{"work_id": 56580688, "full_story": "Trees that reached the sky surrounded me, snow slowly piling up on its branches. I followed the trunk down and saw the trail of sticks and leaves that laid sprawled across Gaea's floor. And finally, the blood that dripped from my chin and onto the ground. A strangely familiar person was lying in my lap. She looked older than me, with long glossy brown hair. She was as tan as I was too. We looked related almost.. When I grow up I want to look like her.\n\nEvery breath she took sent a puff of smoke in the air. I noticed there was a large amount of blood soaking her shirt. Trembling, I lifted it up carefully and found a nasty gash on her abdomen as well as claw marks over her heart. I looked around once more, seeing if there was anything I could use to help with her wounds. Something I can use to stop the bleeding at least. It seemed as if every second I wasted made the body become heavier and heavier. Her eyebrows were scrunched together. It seemed like she was dreaming. Grabbing a handful of random leaves (the ones still intact at least), I pressed it against her stomach and closed my eyes. I had no clue as to what I was doing. The only thing replaying in my head was a desperate wish for her to get better, for her wounds to heal. I prayed for her to get better, for her to wake up okay.\n\nAlmost instantly, her breathing began to change, it went from slow and labored breaths to deep and peaceful ones. I opened my eyes to find two curious brown ones staring back. Carefully, I removed the leaves from her stomach to find no wound painted on it. How is this even possible? Was it me? Looking at her, I asked, \"Are you okay?\" Finding my voice to be hoarse. She looked at me, confused, as if wondering the same things I was. Who she was and what we were doing in the middle of a forest. \"I don't know either,\" I said quietly, reading her expression. The girl got off my lap and sat up. She started to cough, concern filled my eyes. \"Is there anything to drink?\" She croaked out. I shook my head, closing my eyes. I imagined waterfalls, rivers, lakes...\n\nI opened my eyes, looking back at her. Normally I would say I feel comfortable because we're both girls but I felt that there was something deeper... That we're tethered to each other somehow; Broken out of my trance I noticed a river in the distance behind her. I smiled, \"There! It's a river,\" She looked behind to where I pointed. I can't believe it hasn't frozen over yet! We both got up and rushed as fast as we could. My head felt like it was spinning as we ran but once I dipped my feet into the water I felt better. All of a sudden, my vision got clearer. The faint headache I felt coming on, disappeared. And my body felt stronger. I sat down, getting myself more comfortable in the water and played with the pebbles at the bottom. The different textures and patterns of their colors made them so alluring. I turned around to find the girl staring at the water strangely. She seemed almost afraid. How could anyone be afraid of this? Although it was freezing cold, it soothed me. Being in here felt like a breath of fresh air. I would have called her dumb if I hadn't gotten pulled in from behind.\n\nMy vision quickly grew dark and foggy as I sank deeper. The water stung my eyes as I slashed around, trying to get away from whatever was pulling me down. My hair was all over my face blocking my view, and the cold water that once felt comfortable started paralyzing my body. I wasn't sure what to do. Whatever was attacking me seemed almost invisible... but strong. Its presence reminded me of something inhuman... like a god. But why would a god harm me? Aren't they supposed to be good? Where's the surface? It's so dark now, have I been here for a while? Is the girl alright? She's alone. I have to get to her, \"Focus on yourself, you're the one in danger not her,\" A feminine voice said in my mind. She was quickly drowned out by more thoughts. Scrambling, I grabbed one of the biggest rocks I could find and swung it around me. It collided against whatever held me and I swiftly swam back up to the surface. Air finally filled my lungs and I wiped my eyes. I glanced around me, trying to find where I was. Then I saw her, she had passed out once again. Her eyebrows scrunched together as if she was having another bad dream. I crawled towards her, my body now sore from all the fighting in the water. My vision was blurred, and my head was ringing. Coughing harshly, I finally reached her. In an attempt to comfort her, I held her in my arms and gently swayed her like she was a baby. Doing so also comforted me, it reminded me of my mom, where is she...? Then I heard a twig snap behind me.\n\nI looked around. Goosebumps, not only from the harsh wind, but from the feeling of being watched, appeared on my arms. Another pair of twigs snapped and I turned around to find a terrifying bear. The first thing I registered was its size. It was ten times bigger than I was. And I know I'm small but this bear was definitely abnormal. Something in my gut felt off as I noticed its eye, which was halfway from being gouged out. There was blood that was still drying trailing down its nose. It was unnerving. Their sharp pointed claws had blood on them too, I instantly thought back to the claw marks that were on the girl's chest. Realization had set in.\nQuickly, I scrambled away, pulling her body with me. The bear inched towards us slowly, almost like it was waiting to pounce at us. I looked around for a place to hide, to fight with, anything. Then I remembered the river that was near us. Maybe the thing that attacked me would go for the bear also. I pointed behind the bear and yelled \"Look over there!\" The bear turned away. Hastily, I dragged the girl's body behind bushes just outside of the riverbank and sprinted towards the water. The bear's head snapped back towards me instantly. Roaring at me, I yelled back,\"Come at me! Are you scared or something?\" With no clue as to what I was doing, the only thing in my mind was how I needed the bear to follow me into the water. Maybe if I caught a fish and dangled it in front of it? But that wouldn't even work, the bear was looking at me like I was its new treat. The bear kept creeping closer and closer. And I stepped backwards deeper into the water in response. I ended up slipping on a loose rock and fell backwards on my butt. At this, the bear jumped at me, splashing the water in my face and scowling at me. Its fishy breath was in front of my face and smelled disgusting.\n\nAt the same time, something else pulled my hair and dragged me back into the water. A voice rang inside my head, \"Child, you must learn to put yourself first, now you will suffer,\" One moment I was about to get gnawed apart, now I was about to drown by some entity. Kicking strongly, I tried to get myself back up and away from the bear. My desperate attempts to pull back my hair from whatever it was caught on wasn't doing well... And as I saw the bear start clawing through the water, I knew I wasn't going to get out of here alive. I searched for a rock nearby to see if I could do what I did before but found nothing. The entity then latched itself onto my leg. Leaving nasty marks. Blood rapidly mixed with the water's color. I felt so sick. With the pain and the lack of air I couldn't think straight. I couldn't tell if the bear was even there anymore either.\n\nI thought I was being smart but instead I dove into my own death. My life started to flash before my eyes. I saw a little girl, she looked happy, and she always had a bright smile on her face. The little girl then started to grow up. She celebrated her 12th birthday with her family... Had her first date with the cutest boy she ever met when she was 15... And then when she graduated she partied all night with her friends. She got her first job at her family's company. And from then on it got worse. She seemed tired all the time because of all the late nights. And her body looked as if she was skipping all her meals.\nIn these flashes, I saw others as well. They seemed important considering the amount of times they surrounded her throughout her life. One of them was this woman. She didn't seem that tall but by how the girl always reacted, I assumed there was more to her than her appearance. She seemed animalistic, how she treated the girl compared to others. And the lazy eye she had looked disturbing, considering she had only half of it. It reminded me of the bear that was attacking me. As more memories flashed by, she began turning more and more sinister, like a monster.\n\nThen I finally woke up. I stared up at the orange sky, noticing the giant snow covered trees once again. Immediately sitting up, I looked down at my body, to see how my leg looked. But I found nothing. Something feels off.. Where's the bear? My eyes then caught sight of the river. And the small child floating in the middle of it. My heart stopped, I scrambled out of the bushes and ran towards her. Once I finally reached her I pulled her towards me. I brushed the hair out of her face. Her brown eyes stared up towards the sky, lifeless. Her rosy cheeks now had no color to them, and her lips were stained blue. She looked like me, we look the same age too. That was when I realized..\n\nShe was me. I looked down at her leg, and was disgusted by the view of its large bleeding wound. Did I die? Am I all grown up now...? This is so confusing, who's body am I in? Is this my fault? Tears streamed down my face. Through my blurry vision I looked more at my own body, noticing how much bigger I was. I thought about the memories I had seen... and finally understood. She was my inner child. She tried to protect me. And now that she's gone I'm nothing but a dull adult. I should have protected her instead. Now her death is on my hands. I feel so empty, like I'm missing a part of myself. Crying, I closed her... my eyelids and folded her hands in the middle of her chest. The current of the river took her body away as soon as I nudged it out. Then I heard the feminine voice again, \"You have been warned, child. You must act now,\" Abruptly, I woke up. Everything was in my head... but the pain in my heart is still fresh. Finally, I figured it out, this entity was showing me what would happen if I don't start living for myself.\n\n \n\nBut... what entity?", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"56580688\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"drowning\", \"Victim\": \"inner child\", \"Perpetrator\": \"river\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"inner child\", \"Perpetrator\": \"entity/memories\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"narrator's former self\", \"Perpetrator\": \"memories/entity\"} } ```"}

Singing would not save him. \n\nThe rumours spread. He had traded his voice to a god to restore her, he had lost his voice from sadness alone, he had never been all that good anyway. \n\n \n\nTruth lay in the quietest places. \n\nOrpheus had grown used to singing with Eurydice. Nightly duets, dancing and singing until their voices and their legs gave out. \n\nEverything sounded different now, without her. \n\n \n\nThey had been Orpheus and Eurydice, and now he was Orpheus alone. He fell from favour in the eyes of his fans and his friends, no longer willing to perform for them.\n\n \n\nSome, though, did not care what he was willing to do. The Maenads, followers of great Dionysus, begged Orpheus to sing for them, to love them. He refused. \n\n \n\nOrpheus returned to his mother Calliope, who consoled him in his grief. He turned, too, to Apollo, waking each dawn to admire the rising sun. He found solace in the god who had once granted him his music. \n\n \n\nJealous Dionysus offered Orpheus wine, love, treasures beyond any he had seen before. But Orpheus refused, tired of the endless revels he had once played his music for. This angered Dionysus, and he ordered the Maenads, already frenzied by Orpheus's rejection, to tear the former musician to pieces. Orpheus, thinking of his lover in the underworld, did not struggle. \n\n \n\nWhen the deed was done, the Maenads feared the repercussions of their murder. They threw the pieces of Orpheus into the river, and he was taken by the water. \n\n \n\nHis pieces made their way to Calliope, who cried and cried for her lost son.

{"work_id": 57356344, "full_story": "Sun is rising. The cloud reflects some colors, mostly pink, but there are also a couple purple clouds that are turning red with the sun. I frown. I pick up my silver bow and aim at those clouds. The arrow breaks them into nothing.\n\n \n\nSo I was driving my swan chariot, passing through the sky, enjoying the little film happening on earth. Listen to the words they praised for me! Every day they sang my name, and sometimes I would grant them glories if their offerings pleased me. Look at them, a bunch of cowards, rather than fighting in a war, they left their children in hunger, sacrificed those plump sheep to me and hoped I would give them a little pity. Ha, how funny! When necessary, I indeed gave them a little hope, made one of them a hero, so the others would actually believe the same glory will shine on them! How foolish! They would never be loved by me, unless those special ones... \n\nMy eyes stopped on a young man. He was beautiful, more than beautiful, even more beautiful than some of the gods. His chestnut colored hair quivered in the wind, every tan skin and muscle showed his masculinity and strength. His brown eyes were determined and sharp as he swung the sword, and his motions were clean and steady.  I want to own him. \n\n\"He is cute,\" Zephyrus, the west wind, appeared and smiled.\n\n\"He is, and he will be glorified in my name,\" I was annoyed.\n\n\"I do not think so. He will not be your pet just because you are the son of Zeus.\"\n\n\"We shall see.\"\n\nWe both landed on the courtyard the young man was training at. I almost laughed at the look that he was giving, showing his terror.\n\nHe kneeled so fast and lowered his head, dropping his sword aside, \"Your honor, the great god of sun and archery, and the west wind.\"\n\nI grinned, \"get up, and tell me your name.\"\n\nI could tell he was scared, too scared to look at me, \"Your honor, I am Hyacinthus, the son of Pierus, the prince of Sparta.\"\n\n\"I said get up, mortal,\" I wanted to look at his face again.\n\n\"Oh, my dear, do not be scared by him,\" Zephyrus went up and lifted his face, \"just be yourself.\"\n\nI frowned that Zephyrus contaminated his face, but Hyacinthus did look up. With this closer look, he was even more beautiful. Every line, every shape on his face rhymes perfectly. He looked straight into my eyes, fear and a little shine of the water in his eyes.\n\n\"I gave you an offer,\" he shivered again when I spoke, \"you come on to my chariot, and in return, you will be honored in my name.\"\n\n\"I can show you everywhere in the world, and you will be remembered when the west wind blows,\" Zephyrus was pleased by his offering.\n\nThe mortal looked at Zephyrus, then turned to me. He stood up, I was better, or maybe it was the fear, he stepped to me, \"Thank you, the god of  sun and archery, for your kind offering,\" then he turned to Zephyrus, \"and thank you the west wind, I feel honored by you.\"\n\nHyacinthus stepped onto my chariot, not with full confidence, but he was on it. I smiled at Zephyrus.  See, mortals know who will give them more. Then I stepped on to my swan chariot, not looking back at Zephyrus's swelled face. There might be a tornado tonight.\n\n \n\n \n\nTo make a person respect you, you must show them your power. \n\nWe were flying with my chariot, so silence in sound, but not silence inside.\n\n\"Speak,\" I did not look at him, to show my carelessness.\n\n\"Your honor, where are we heading?\" His voice was solid but lithe in the silence.\n\n\"My lands.\"\n\nFollowed by silence.\n\nI turned to him. He was scared, again, so he stood up. He stood too quickly, so he lost his balance. He was about to fall out of my chariot. I grabbed him, pulling him back to the seat. His skin was rough by the training but soft and delicate.\n\n\"Thank you, your--\"\n\n\"Thank me with your heart. We cannot be companions if you hold all your questions.\"\n\nSilence again. The silence was dragging me to anger. I could throw him from my chariot.\n\n\"Companions?\" He finally spoke, \"No hard mission like slaying a dragon?\"\n\nI almost laughed, \"then the dragon would be dead already, no need for you to kill. Come, we arrived. This is one of my lands, Delphi.\"\n\nThis was a wild highland of Delphi. I did not want anyone to interrupt us. Hyacinthus was amazed by the city below, by its prosperity.\n\n\"Done, let us go to the next--\"\n\n\"Wait!\" I was surprised. A mortal interrupted me, but also I was surprised that I was not feeling mad at all. Hyacinthus seemed to notice what he had done, he lowered his head and remained quiet.\n\n\"It will be ruder if you stop me for nothing.\"\n\nHe was scared again, not knowing what to do, \"may I stay longer? Perhaps join the market?\"\n\n\"No,\" he must stick to my plan, so he will know how strong I am and feel honored and satisfied.\n\nHe looks scared again, but more upset this time.\n\n\"Why do you show grief, mortal? Are you not happy that you came to Delphi, the sacred land of Apollo, with Apollo himself?\"\n\n\"I am happy, your honor, I am happy for your kindness. We may leave.\" He lowered his head, trembling.\n\n\"You dare to lie to a god and show fake gratefulness?\" I was angry, a foolish mortal again. He ruined everything, \"I have changed my mind, you will be sent back to Amyclae and never be loved by me--\"\n\n\"It was you who said we are companions! And you even do not know what a companion is! At least show me some respect!\" He ran down to the hill.\n\nI was shocked. Never a mortal would rebel against me, never asking me for respect. Was not my notice of them the greatest respect? Why was he angry? He should be afraid in front of my anger. \n\nI found him in the crowd. He was easy to find, among the ugly, small mortals.\n\n\"Show me what companions do,\" there was no compromise, but only my interest in him. \n\n\"Call me Hyacinthus, I have a name.\"\n\n\"Hyacinthus,\" my tongue was twisted maybe, I do not often say a mortal's name.\n\n\"Greetings, Apollo,\" he looked back, not in fear, but with a smile, softer than the spring, fiercer than the summer. Brighter than ever.\n\nI looked at him, then looked away. It was absurd to hear a faint, weak voice saying my name directly, but I felt no anger, my blood and heart were plumping faster, not knowing why.\n\n \n\n \n\nDays, maybe months passed. Everything was following my plan, well, mostly. I showed him my silver bow and archery, granted him a little glimpse of the art of prophecy.\n\n\"What prophecy do you see about me?\" Hyacinthus lowered my silver bow and asked.\n\n\"A flower, a single stem and many little small flowers attached to it. Purple with red on the edge.\"\n\n\"Hmmm, it might be a flower you made for me.\"\n\nI smiled, not answering.\n\nMost mortals praised me for my power of archery, and I was more known for it. Hyacinthus, instead, loved my music more than my power. I taught him how to play the lyre, his hands seemed small on my lyre. He played me a little piece, not refined, but it was good. Then I played to him. He closed his eyes, sinking in my music. \n\nThe time seems to freeze, sunbeams laid on his face, me playing my lyre and him being the audience. My impulses wanted to break through this moment. I moved closer. I kissed him on his forehead. He suddenly opened his eyes, blushing.\n\n\"So what is that wreath on your head?\" He gave me an awkward smile.\n\nI grinned at his little shyness, \"a laurel wreath, turned from a nymph named Daphne.\"\n\n\"What happened to her?\" He looks a little worried.\n\nI told him how I made Ero, the love god, angry, then shoot me with my arrow to make me indulge in love with Daphne while she was shot to hate me. Finally, she turned into a laurel tree to escape from me. And there were more women who ran away from me for Ero's sake.\n\n\"You never know how scared I am that you may be another scam of Ero.\"  I mean it.  The feeling that I love those women but not loving them myself disgusted me.\n\nHyacinthus grinned, taking my hand to his chest. His rhythmic, strong heart beat with my impulses, my heart never beaten so fast. He closed his eyes, his lips met mine. My mind went blank, filled with him, his lips, his breath, his warmth,  his everything.  For the first time, something was not under my control. \n\nHe then let go, looking at me. His eyes glowed with the world, with me.\n\n\"I am here. I am real.\"\n\n \n\n\"Here is Delos, where I was born.\" We arrived at the last stop of my plan.\n\nHyacinthus was excited to see my past. His eyes shone with curiosity. He ran up to the cabinet, where I lived when I was still a young god. I stayed at the same place and watched him looking around. He put his hand on the wood door, he turned back and looked at me, \" you are not coming with me?\"\n\nI shook my head. Nothing in there was worthy for me to look at and recall. The past laid in the past, and I am no Apollo who I was.\n\nHyacinthus walked out from the cabinet, still with his curiosity, \"who owns the other bed? And that loom? You were a hunter?\"\n\n\"The other belongs to my sister, Artemis, goddess of wild animals and the hunt. Yes, we hunted in the woods a lot. And that loom belongs to my mother, Leto,\" I have not spoken that name for so long.\n\n\"Well, then I must salute to your sister and mother, or I would be rude.\"\n\n\"No need, Artemis does not live here anymore, and Leto is dead,\" I paused and looked at him, he had a worried look on his face, \"She was killed by a serpent named Python, who was sent by Hera for her jealousy. No worries,\" I smiled at him, \"The serpent was killed by me when  I was still a child. You know, I am a good hunter.\"\n\nHe looked at me, full of sorrow in his eyes. I did not quite understand why he was sad  about my mother's death, even I did not grieve for her death. It was normal that the gods fight each other for jealousy. The ones with no power will be the sacrifice of the fight, and the strong ones like me, will win and enjoy the glory.  No need to grieve for the forgotten. \n\nHyacinthus seems to see my confusion. He gave me a hug, his hands tapping on my back, our hearts joining each other. I felt something melting in my heart. Maybe  I was sad. \n\n\"Come, bring me to my place,\" he stepped on the chariot.\n\n \n\n \n\n\"Here, put this on,\" Hyacinthus handed me mortal clothes.\n\n\"For what,\" I wore the clothes. The fabric was rough and the weaving was not fine. I felt uncomfortable and  ashamed.  God in mortal's clothes, what a joke. My skin will remember this disgrace forever.\n\n\"You showed me your lands and your home, now it is my turn.\"\n\nI thought he was going to let me visit his palace house, showing his wealth among the rest. Instead, he brought me to the harbor, dirty, messy, and smelly. \n\nShips and vessels moored and settled sail. Mortals walked around, busy at their work. Sailors yelled to sail, sellers yelled for sale. Young mortal ran around, chasing for money and bread. Female mortals weaved in the shop and carried fabric around. Dogs and cats hid in the dark or found food in the trash. In those dim light allay, homeless mortals laid on the ground, hoping for a rescue.  Something stopped me from laughing at them. \n\n\"Sorry for staining your deity, but this is us.\"\n\n Us. Mortals.  What was I hoping for, we would never be the same. We were born to be different, so we would live parallel, the lines that could be so close, but never intersect.\n\nHe then went on, fulfilling the duty of a future king. He granted bread and covers for those homeless, hopeless ones. He smiled at them and wished them a good day. I did not understand why he helped them. They were no use for this state. It was already a great mercy to leave them alive rather than killing them.\n\n\"People are the core of a kingdom,\" Hyacinthus seemed to read my mind, \"a king is only powerful when he gets people to protect. Without them, a king is just a delicate egg shell,\" he looked at the cracked egg on the ground, \"Here, try it,\" he handed me some bread.\n\nI found a woman, covered in a ragged cloth, sitting on the ground and begging for some change to live through the day. I thought I was standing close enough. This was absurd, all I needed to do was to throw the bread in front of her and leave, and she would be grateful for the bread falling from the sky. No need to have a fake smile. I looked at Hyacinthus, he gestured to me to squat. Squat? A graceful god never squatted, only laborers and mortals did that. With a sigh, I bent my knees and lowered myself to the same height as the woman. I was never this lowly, this would be the stain of my deity.\n\n\"Mor-- Lady, wish you a nice day,\"  I reached out my hand with the bread. I looked away, trying not to stare at her. This embarrassment was killing me.\n\n\"Thank you! Oh thank you, kind young man,\" the woman looked up, staring straight into mine. There was liquid at the corner of her eyes. Her face was covered with wrinkles and scars, burn scars, beating scars. Her eyes were like a dead hollow, but I could see the reflection of my light. This horrible figure stabbed me like a knife, injecting a feeling of silver, pricking at my spine.  Guilt and apology.  Her two hands grabbing my arm, trembling, \"May the great god of sun bless you.\"\n\nI grinned, would I bless myself? I looked at Hyacinthus again. Maybe I would, \"May the god of sun bless you too,\" I put my hand on her shoulder, letting my power of healing flow in her. The wrinkles and scars slowly faded from her face. She smiled, like a yellow flower on the cactus in the middle of a desert. It bloomed in me, releasing a yellowish feeling mixed with the silver.  Joy and sadness. \n\nI went back to Hyacinthus. The new feeling still remained in me. It pleased me but also discomforted me. I would say I was a little scared of this feeling.  Feeling mortal.  \n\nI did not look at him, pretending to speak delightfully.\n\n\"I think there was some problem with her eyes, the liquid that I cannot heal.\"\n\nHe laughed. His laughter made me laugh too, \"That is no disease, it is tears.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"It cannot be described. Sometimes it is sorrow, sometimes joy, sometimes anger. It can barely be held by reason.\"\n\nThen I would never have a tear.  Nothing escapes my chess of reason. \n\nWe moved on. Let that silver yellow flow in me. \n\nThere was a miracle that happened in that harbor of Sparta.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe night fell. The stars hung above us, the trees hid their green, the owls stared their eyes in the darkness. Artemis was somewhere in the world hunting her prey.\n\n\"Ah, what a nice day,\" Hyacinthus leaned on a rock. Dim light reflected on his visage, making his face more angular.  More beautiful than ever.  His eyes shone with the stars.\n\nI sat beside him. The grass surrounding us was lit up by me, \"why is it nice?\"\n\nHe glimpsed at me with a weird look, \"why are you always looking for a reason? There are many things that do not have a reason,\" he leaned towards me, so close that his breath touched my neck, \"but if you really want a reason--\" he bit my ear gently and retreated with his bright smile, but there was a little shyness this time. \n\n\"Well, then this will be a nice day for me too,\" I turned to him, pressing my lips onto his. Why would I say that,  every day for me is the same.  But maybe these days did go well. Hyacinthus responded and pressed harder. Tonight,  it will be nice.   \n\n \n\nOne good thing about being a god was that I did not need to sleep, but I could. Hyacinthus lay on my shoulder, his chest raised and fell along his breath. My head rested on his, I closed my eyes.\n\nI was sitting on my bed, not the one in my palace, but the one in that cabinet on Delos. Everything was at their same place: my bed next to Artemis's, our desk for crafting weapons, and that loom covered in ashes that our mother used to weave at. I pushed the door open and saw the tree that Artemis and I used to target. At the bottom of that tree, there was a woman weaving.\n\n\"Mother?\" \n\nThe woman looked up, smiling at me.\n\nI could not believe what I was seeing, no prophecy showed my mother was still alive. I walked faster and faster, and I ran. My body felt smaller and smaller - I was a child. I rushed to her, but I was tripped by a rock. Mother stood up and granted me a hand. She smiled, the smile that I remembered in my childhood, \"Here, Apollo, get up.\"\n\nI reached out my hand and tried to grab hers. Behind her, I glimpsed a slender figure - a serpent, curling on a branch, opened his mouth and bit mother's neck. Instinctively, mother fell on the ground. Her purple robe was soaked in her red blood. \n\n\n Dead in that purple with the red on the edge. \n\n\n\"Mother!' I screamed.\n\n\"Apollo?\" Hyacinthus looked at me with worry, \"what was it?\"\n\nI opened my mouth, but the words stuck at my throat. When did I start to find comfort from mortals? I need no comfort at all. I shook my head and smiled, \"Minor things.\"\n\nHyacinthus said nothing. The night went on, and I fell asleep again. In my half-consciousness,   I felt warmth , like I was held in my mother's arms.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe sun shone in front of us, the wind blew up the corner of his clothes against my skin.  Itchy. \n\n\"You sure you wanna play discus with me?\" I looked at him, and could not believe a mortal who is shorter than me for a whole head dared to challenge a god.\n\n\"Yeah, is there a problem?\" He looked up straight into my eyes. My light shone in his eyes, but his light never faded. \n\n\"Sure, then show me what a mortal can do,\" I stepped backwards, holding the discus tight in my hand. I twisted my back, tensing up my muscles...  \n\n\"Ha,\" the moment I threw the discus, it disappeared in the light.\n\nHe narrowed his eyes to try to follow the discus, but he suddenly looked at me with that bright smile, \"write me a song if I catch it.\" Then, he ran forward like an arrow of my bow, fast, clean, determined.\n\nHis muscles tightened to a gorgeous shape as he ran. He looks free, free from the world, free from being a mortal. He got further and further, becoming a little dot on the paint of blue sky and green grass. I never knew the power of nature itself. The sun stayed in the sky, clouds stopped their steps, trees and leaves remained where they were. Then all together, with a gust of west wind, quivering, trembling... \n\n\n Wait. \n\n\n\"Hyacinthus!\" I ran to him, as fast as I could, the wind crying and laughing besides my ears.\n\nHow could I, how could I not notice, how could I forget? Jealousy is their daily entertainment. If they cannot have it, then no one can. This was a game about me and Zephyrus, and the wager is Hyacinthus.\n\n\"Run Apollo, run. We made a bet about you, and I say the discus is faster,\" Zephyrus laid in the air beside me, laughing harder and harder.\n\nI am Apollo, son of Zeus and Leto, this kind of small breeze cannot stop me. The ground under my feet flew back. The discus carried by the west wind was still far up in the air. Closer and closer, I can almost touch him, touching  my sun ... \n\n\"No no no, Apollo,\" a surge of west wind made me lose balance, \"the audience are glad to see the son of Zeus is defeated by a discus.\"\n\nHyacinthus noticed my existence. He turned back and saw me sitting on the ground. He cannot see Zephyrus, neither hearing the wind, nor hearing me.\n\n\"What,\" Hyacinthus laughed, laughing so hard that he could not even open his eyes, \"a god can fall on the ground too? Here, get up,\" he granted a hand to me. The sun shines behind him, but it seems like it is himself shining. For a moment, my mother was standing in front of me. I tried to reach for his hand, grabbing the light.\n\nThe discus was getting closer. I had no time. I did not care what power I was using. The grass was decaying but reviving again. Songs were sung and poems were told. Thousands of prophecies flew through my vision. I was standing up, it seemed like the pressure of the wind was weaker. I leaned forward, reaching to his arm.  So close!  My hand broke through the barrier of the wind, grabbing his hand. \n\nA prophecy blinded my eyes.  The flower. \n\nThe discus rolled on the ground. Trees and grasses slowly danced in their tempo. Birds twittered on the branches. Sunshine spilled on us.  Warm.  \n\nHe was in my arms. A smile was still on his face. His chest stayed still. The blood from his forehead dripped into my hand.  Warm. \n\nThe light in him was fading.\n\n\n No! No no no, this could not be. \n\n\nI tried to capture those lights, tried to hold them in my hands. I used my power of healing, broken bones were repaired and opened skin was closed. I sang, singing every song he liked. Why do they sound  sorrowful ? My head dropped onto his chest, hoping to hear that rhythmic, strong heartbeat. \n\nNothing. \n\nMy eyes felt weird, weird liquid filled in them. A tear, that is what he told me.\n\nMy tear dripped into those lights. They glowed. Stems and leaves grew out first, then a little purple bud attached, popping up. Last, it bloomed. I held it in my palms, blood dripping into the flower.\n\n\n That purple with the red on the edge. \n\n\nI stood up, putting the flower on his chest. Slowly, he sank into the ground, and surrounding him, purple flowers broke from the dirt and bloomed. \n\n \n\nThat day, I truly felt sadness. But then I lose it. Something overcomes the grief, hiding it away. My heart, if I had one, became heavier as he sank. The tear on my face vaporized by my heat. I know things would end like this at the beginning, what made me choose to ignore and pretend? I was never like this. \n\nMaybe it is wrong at the beginning. Maybe I should not have noticed him that day. Maybe no mortal and god can last long. Maybe not the weak can be appreciated. Like Leto, he is just a sacrifice of jealousy, the price he pays for being a mortal. No need to be cried for.  Power is the only useful one in this world.  \n\nFor sure, I have no heart, because it lies there, within that purple and red.\n\n ", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"57356344\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"mother\", \"Perpetrator\": \"implied jealousy\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"discus\", \"Victim\": \"Hyacinthus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zephyrus\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 57183703, "full_story": "\nI watched my father come down to this earth from his high stoop on Olympus. He looked presumptuously confident and stupid, with his golden hair and horse-drawn chariot floating gracefully from the sky. If I were with my friends from the village, they would fall to their knees and pray to the God Apollo for being so kind as to visit them. They couldn't be more stupid. \n\n\n\nWhen his chariot touched the ground, it was as if the air stilled, all of the bees buzzing, the saccharine smell of the flowers, and the light breeze brushing my cheeks refused to move. Warmth clung to my skin, and the wind carried the salty smell of the sea. \n\n\n\n     \"My son! I have brought a gift for you!\" He ran a hand through my hair, the other hidden behind his large torso. Red cloth was hidden under bronze armor, a symbol of the sun plated on his chest. He was sinewy in a way no mortal could ever achieve as if his every muscle was carved from the finest marble.  \n\n\n\n     \"Pater, you did not have to get me anything. It is nice enough to see you after you have been in Olympus for so long.\" \n\n\n\n     \"Nonsense, my boy, you deserve such a gift, for you are the son of Apollo! My Orpheus, with all my best qualities and, hopefully, my good musical skill.\" His voice was gruff as it spewed compliments, which I was sure I did not deserve. The moment's suspense vanished as he revealed an intricate instrument with strings pulled tight between its tan frame. \"It is a lyre, my son; sit, and I will show you how to play it.\" The log scratched against the back of my thighs, the sweet sap clinging greedily to my tunic. \n\n\n\n Pater's hands moved over my own gently as he directed the fundamental teachings. It was as if his hands were the only mechanism designed to play this instrument, to coax such a sweet sound out of something so tense. My fingers strummed along with his, never entirely placing them right to copy the charming sound. The way mine fiddled made the strings crack.  \n\n\n\n     Pater did not seem impressed with how I did my best to mimic him, with how I puffed out my chest to attempt to stand as tall as him. No matter how much I breathe in and provide air to my stomach, I can never fully encompass everything as he does. \n\n\n\nHe enraptured anything and everything; the healthy, yellowish ochre that subdued his skin made him shine so much more than me in every sense. Being a God meant he was more significant than any life in Greece, and his reluctant neglect always reminded me of that. He was here when he wanted to be but never when I needed him. \n\n\n\n\"Good, my son. Not great, but good. Much better than the other mortals.\" His dark skin, tanned to a deep bronze from his many hours coaching the sun through cerulean skies, looked strange against mine. Not because the colors were so similar but because his touch was too foreign to feel normal. \n\n\n\n\"Thank you, Pater.\" For a god of the thing that heats all of Greece, he certainly does not enjoy giving the same attention to me. \n\n\n\n\"Take care of your mother, Orpheus. She is a good woman.\" My mother has always waited for him, no matter how long he has avoided her. In her eyes, if he meets with me, he still loves her. How stupid is she? He doesn't even love his son. He loves the attention and mimicking because it feeds his godly ego. \n\n\n\nWith that, he leaves me on the log, with the lyre in my hand, and descends to the sky on his chariot. I've always wanted to be close enough to him to see how he moves the sun in such patient increments, but instead of being able to see him, the sun's iridescent yellow streaks block my vision. \n\n\n\nAgainst my bare feet, the road leading home is chalky and dry dirt, jamming into the cracks on my heels that have taken form over the long summers. The road's ruts, designed for the merchant's carts, make me feel like a bobbing line trying to draw fish in. \n\n\n\nThe market is closing for the day, and people are going home to their families and lives that I envy. One's with fathers who do not direct the bright sun to shadow me as his shame and mothers who refuse to see the earth and its gods for what they truly are.\n\n\n\nI blend into the hordes rushing home, snagging a ripe fig from the first street stall I see. Money is not one of all the gifts my father has given me. It's too much of an earthly concern. \n\n\n\nMy teeth sink into the plush fruit, and warm, sticky juice cascades down my chin. The skin is bitter, a direct contrast to the obscenely sweet inside, and when it touches my tongue, my jaw twinges. \n\n\n\nI follow the crowd, my chest surging with the need for something distracting and not wanting to return home to my mother and her questions about my father. She is obsessed with the fact that Apollo had chosen her once upon a time and naively forgets that he continuously treats us as nothing but his mortal play toys. \n\n\n\nThe hordes of people are not migrating to the cottages, though. They are trickling into the amphitheater, sitting on the rising seats one by one, making the oval shape appear more rounded as their bodies buzz excitedly. My fig is only one bite in, and a show is forming. \n\n\n\nMystical colors draped over men's bodies infiltrate the monochrome gray of the stage, and the people in the crowd watch in amazement. The actors on the stage converse with each other in hushed tones, their muscular builds bumping into one another as they huddle. \n\n\n\nMy seat is at the theater's very back and upper part, the setting sun's last embers striving to reach my shoulders. The atmosphere is hot, the air between everyone doused with an electric crackle of anticipation. \n\n\n\nThe very minute the men begin performing in all their draperies and thunderous tones is when the crowd silences, not even a whisper being muttered on their lips. The play is fine, the music good, but something is amiss. No one seems to care about their craft, about toning it to perfection. I almost wish to laugh at them, but everyone else seems too enthralled with the menial performance to pay that much attention to me. \n\n\n\nMy attention is drawn from the stage when a melodic laugh rings out, sounding more in tune than my father's fingers on the lyre. The fig falls from my hand, smattering on the top of my feet with a wet smack and coating them in the sticky juice. \n\n\n\nHer hair is black like a night sky, but her velvety skin is subdued with a pale pink underwash. Her body flows into soft folds and rounded features, everything about her intricately placed as if designed by Aphrodite. I know of her vaguely, as the town's matrons talk about her and how none of them know where she comes from, but they do know her name. Eurydice.  \n\n\n\nFor the remainder of this part, my eyes never left her. Even when the acting improved, she was the show's star with her effortless beauty and... very full coin byrsa. It was a pretty little thing, made of leather and folded into her robes' soft, deep purple linen. It would be degradingly easy to snatch off her hip if I was able to get close enough. \n\n\n\nMoney fuels people, even if how they get it taints their souls and drags on their minds. I don't want to rob her of something so familiar as money, but it is the one thing I need to survive on this earth. \n\n\n\nThe lyre was heavy in my hand, and the splattered fig juice stained the skin of my feet to a reddish-brown color. It forced the dirt kicked up by the audience to stick and collect in clusters of irritating grains.  \n\n\n\nInfiltrating the orchestra is the easiest part, sitting amongst the other lyres and ducking my head from the beautiful woman's view. It looked like I was just late to the performance, scuffling amongst the other boys with instruments and finding an empty sack full of straw to rest on. Bony knees and elbows collide, a sign of youth and a reminder that we are much lesser physically than the fathers we have adored. \n\n\n\nMy father infiltrates everything, even the beautiful woman. The laurel leaves on her head are a potent reminder of how he is embedded in the stories of Greece and praised as giving life to us in the form of the sun. \n\n\n\nOnce the music begins, it's the only thing my ears will allow me to hear and mimic. Each musical note seems to come alive, ascend to my ears, and fill my chest with adrenaline. A block of too-thick air stopped me from breathing too profoundly, slowly morphing the adrenaline into intense anxiety. \n\n\n\nMy fingers ache from the strings of the lyre, each bound wire digging into my fingertips when I pull at them. My forearms burn from the constant traction of plucking and pushing, and I am drowning in the music and striving to create my best work. \n\n\n\nMy efforts feel like they are for naught when I realize the other boys have put their instruments in the cradles of their laps, their necks craning to look at how I play. The actors stopped acting, the crowds stopped jeering, and even the woman stopped laughing. \n\n\n\nFor once in my life, I am not overshadowed by my father. I am bathed in the night, away from his eyes and his sun, basking in their attention for something I could do instead of feeling like I was merely a dented trophy of my father's.  \n\n\n\nThe song tapered off, my arms and fingers not feeling the intense need to keep creating beautiful noise. My body feels hot, sweat trickling down into my toga's neck and staining it to a deep white.   Embarrassment unblocks the air in my throat, all of the oxygen I had missed in the throes of needy passion suddenly invading my lungs. The show feels disrupted, the comedic flow of the night trickling away as the extended silence ebbs through the amphitheater. \n\n\n\nI was standing, a nervous ball of too-thin knees and knobby elbows. I mumbled my apologies, the curve of the lyre's wood coarse against the veins of my wrist as I wrenched a handout and ripped the coin purse from the woman's belt. It was a violent motion that not even the stupidest of people could mistake my actions for anything less than malicious. \n\n\n\nI rush out of the amphitheater under the main awning, a hot ball of guilt forming in my stomach and my fingers clenching the bag so tightly that my nails create crescent moons in my palms. I can hear her yell to come back, to give her the coin purse like a siren when it drags the men to the depths. She wasn't just pretty. She was vaguely threatening as she chased me. \n\n\n\nIt's hot in the way that spilled wine sticks to a table, invading the splinters with its stickiness. The heat clings to the crevices of your skin in a way that one will never get clean, and sweat cascades down every inch of my body, making me feel slimy. \n\n\n\nSmall pebbles cut into my feet and kicked-up dirt plumes made my legs' skin dry. Looking over my shoulder, the fabric of her skirt was bunched around her hands in thick whorls, revealing thick leather sandals that pounded the ground as she chased me. \n\n\n\nShe wanted this back, and I couldn't let her have it. I needed it. \n\n\n\nThe distance between us lessened as every muscle in my body tired, the lyre and coin bag dragging my arms down. I could only think selfishly of myself and my mother and how this much money would fix so many problems instead of thinking about what would happen to this young woman if she lost it. \n\n\n\nRounding a corner, my heart beat inside my chest faster than my feet hit the ground. The streets were getting more corrugated as we delved into the dingier parts of town, the extravagant temples and amphitheaters turning into dirty cottages and starving children playing with sticks on the side of the road. \n\n\n\nIn my sweat-polluted toga and rawboned body, I looked as if I belonged. Looking like she was Greek royalty, Eurydice seemed out of place, her angered face and potent emotions rolling off her in waves. The people in this part of the city don't care, for they have figured that the Gods have already given up on them, so her ardor only adds to her transcending from the crowd.   \n\n\n\nMy chest concaves with every breath, allowing every sharp intake to dig deep into my lungs. My calves and fingers ache, but she is so close to me. If she reached a hand out, she could rip me back and get what she wanted. \n\n\n\nMy legs quake underneath me, threatening to snap like toothpicks, and I don't dare take another step. I am overexerted, yet as she stops, she seems as if it is rejuvenating for her. She stands tall, the bundles of her skirt falling from her hands and looping around her feet in plum waterfalls. I somehow ended up on the ground, cradling my arms to my chest and leaving the bag and the lyre in the dirt. There is an uncomfortable pinch on my dry knees, but I am unsure if it is internal or external. \n\n\n\nShe looks warm, with the glow from the moonlight making her skin shine over the rosy hue that covers every inch of her body. She shines like my father, almost in a Godly way, and something about her makes me feel less than. She gives off this feeling of exuberance that encompasses not only her but the very air and grass under her feet. \n\n\n\n\"Give it back.\" She demanded, her tone cold and entirely different from how she had been in the amphitheater. \"Now, young man. You can make your living with that lyre. You don't need to steal from me.\" \n\n\n\nThe more she spoke, the more beautiful I realized she was. Her hand was hoisted down at me expectantly, even though she could lean down to pick it up. \n\n\n\n\"Ma'am, I cannot give it back. If I could, I would.\" \n\n\n\n\"You can, and you will. Put it in my hand.\" I don't know why she is so adamant that I give it back to her; maybe it's some sick sense of a power move. \n\n\n\n\"Ma'am, please, I need this money.\" I feel pathetic, my hands shaking as I wiggle my fingers closer to the bag in a desperate attempt to retrieve it. She could have taken it, but she didn't. She wanted me to serve her like she was some kind of God. \n\n\n\n\"I said give it back, small boy. I will not beg you to return what is mine.\" Her voice was barely above a whisper, but her face was smooth as silk. The only indication that she was less than perfect was the tiny pinch of her brow and the scanty frown of her lips.\n\n\n\n\"And I said I needed it.\" I am all arrogance and hubris, demanding something of her that I did not deserve to take.\n\n\n\nMy hand wraps around the bag's opening, feeling smooth leather and cording, and I try to drag it toward me. This action is counteracted by her foot stomping on my hand, crunching down until my fingers make grotesque popping noises. My jaw clenches in absolute pain, but I don't allow myself to cry. That would give her too much power. \n\n\n\nOn the dirt path, weaving around rocks, something sleek and scaly bridles up to her ankle, wrapping itself around the foot she was holding herself up with. A snake, its eyes charging into the tiniest of slits, reared its menacing head back. Before I could stop it, sharp teeth were brutally digging into her skin, forcing crimson blood out of two round holes. It was so dark that it almost looked violet. \n\n\n\nHer shrill scream pierced the air, the pain too much for her to bear. Her pain morphed her cold face into one full of heat, with flushed cheeks and a sneer so hideous that it would rival Medusa's. The snake pulled away after draining its venom into her, the leftover clear liquid infusing itself with the free-flowing blood. \n\n\n\nAs she fell to the earth, her God-like shine drained away from her face. I couldn't move fast enough to catch her, so dust rose around where her body had fallen in thick plumes. Straggling over her, I brushed dark, thin strands of hair away from her placid face. \n\n\n\n     She was dead. She had to be. Her fixed gaze rested on the moon, but the vivid spark of her eyes and easy smile were gone. Nothing was left of the woman I had robbed, and her brightness was taken from the world. \n\n\n\nGuilt forms in my stomach as a ball of a black, hot, stenchy substance, and my eyes water incredulously. I blamed myself for the death of this girl who had been so full of life and had been trying to live the best she could until I obstructed that. My tears soaked into her robes, and my fingers held her skin that was chilling by the second. \n\n\n\nI couldn't manage to stop crying, even when I felt the presence of something otherworldly and heat similar to the sun's basking on my shoulders. Turning from her body, from where her soul had fizzled into the dirt of the earth and the underworld, I saw my father. He didn't touch me or try to provide any comfort. He was standing there while I was at his feet, mourning over a woman I didn't know. I don't know why or where he got the audacity to show up here and now. \n\n\n\n\"Pater?\" My voice cracked, my brown eyes red and teary. \n\n\n\n\"My son! Get up. Stop mourning her! She was just a wood nymph! I sent the snake to protect you. I thought you'd be happy and running off to pay your mother's debts!\" His boisterous laughter filled the air, and even in the night, he shone. Her being a wood nymph explained her attitude and how she absorbed all of my attention, but did she deserve to die for this? \n\n\n\n\"She didn't deserve that! I was the one that stole from her!\" I stood, my legs still recovering from running and shaking. \"You killed her for fighting for what is rightfully hers! You should have killed me!\" My father has a very distorted sense of right and wrong, thinking that what is his is the only thing that matters. \n\n\n\n\"My son, you are blinded by Eros! She was pretty but not a thing to be blinded over,\" His voice was calm and collected, his smile never leaving his face. He was so sure that he was right. \n\n\n\n\"Father, I do not have to love her to realize she didn't deserve that! Where is your humanity?\" He reared back, the smile turning into a sneer, revealing a thin row of his teeth. His hand looked as if it itched to rise, jumping at his side and pinching at his tunic. \n\n\n\n\"I am no human! I do not have their insipid values or their mortal beliefs. You are a fool, Orpheus, and you must realize you are my son. You are a demigod! Start acting like one.\" He went to turn from me, to vanish to Olympus again, but I grabbed his shoulder. Fear spiked in my chest when I saw his clenched jaw and cheeks flushed from anger. \n\n\n\n\"Send me down there so I can retrieve her. I know you can.\" On any mortal, the intense pressure of my nails on their skin would mar them and create blood, but my father stood tall and unflinching. \n\n\n\n\"No, my son. I just protected you. I will not send you down there to die,\" His tone revealed that he did mean his words, even if they were full of anger. I departed from his shoulder to retrieve a coin from the bag to pay Chiron to pass the river Styx and the lyre. It has become comfortable in my hand and is my only notable earthly possession, so I decide to take it. \n\n\n\n\"You told me to start acting like a demigod. Allow me to rival Hercules' courage, to brave the monsters like Perseus, or even become great only to die like Achilles!\" My father was not satisfied with only me; he wanted me to be great, and the myths told throughout my childhood allowed me to beg to be better and satisfy that need of his. \n\n\n\n\"Fine, son. But if you do not come back, I warned you. The underworld is a not so forgiving place.\" His rage cooled in front of my eyes, and the red tint of his skin was completely gone. He was more ominous than angered. \n\n\n\n    His hands flicked, orange sparks of what seemed to be sunshine crawling up his arms and encompassing his shoulders. It breathed a new kind of life into the space around us, charging it with energy and sounding like it was heaving for air. The sparks fan out into hot flames, engulfing both of us until all I could see was orange. I immediately start sweating, but my father appears to be in his element in this heat, the flames cradling him like they are cherishing him. \n\n\n\nA large circle of black appears in front of me, tendrils of cold air curling out from it. I stand on my toes to push just past the edge, my eyes instantly seeing lines of men, women, and children with coins piled in their hands and waiting for their turn to cross the river Styx. Some look as if they are still alive, with flushed cheeks and full bodies, while others look hollow. \n\n\n\n\"Go. Hades awaits you.\" My father whispers, his muscles tensing as the black circle wavers. The obscene roundness started fading as the curves became fuzzy, black bleeding into the orange flames. Whether he was struggling to contain it or struggling to keep it alive, I am not sure. \n\n\n\nIt is cold. For some reason, I expected it to be swelteringly hot. The dirt down here flies around heads and curls around limbs as if inspecting everyone before allowing them entry to its home, and the souls of what once were people seem irritated by it. There are no plants or sun, just endless miles of cold desert dirt and gray sky. \n\n\n\nThere is no trace of the sun that my father so desperately loves, and the darkness down here is welcoming. \n\n\n\nTraversing the line of souls revealed that they were only a mist that came apart when touched, only to float back together again. I pushed my way to the front, feeling the cold spray of the Styx on my feet. It washed away the dirt, and the fig juice in small splatters, and the water of the shore rippled as a wooden boat approached. \n\n\n\nI look up, chills running along my spine as my eyes connect with his. Chiron is tall but hunched, with a curved nose and blue eyes that resemble the bright Greek oceans. His dark cloak pools around his feet and in the boat, his sleeves falling back to reveal pale skin and hands clenched around a wooden stick that delves into the water. \n\n\n\nHe makes the idea that I may die down here real. \n\n\n\n\"You are alive. I can smell it on you, and it reeks.\" His voice is gravelly and deep, coming out of cracked lips. \n\n\n\n\"I just need to retrieve someone, and then I will return.\" His eyes narrow into thin slits of blue. I tuck the lyre into my belt so that I do not have to hold it in my hand and have it drag me down. \n\n\n\n\"Hades will not allow you to steal someone back from his realm.\" \n\n\n\n\"I just need passage,\" I say, handing him the coin. It is warmed by my living hands, not as cold as the ones he usually gets, but he accepts it regardless. Along with some others, I board the small craft, journeying across the black depths. I can't hear anything besides my breathing in the middle of the river. The water seems to be rushing under the boat in fast currents, but it is so quiet. \n\n\n\nOn the other side of the river, I am greeted with dry, brown grass crunching under my naked feet. This side is cold as well, a result of being hidden from the sun. It is a comfortable solace to know my father could not see me down here, even if he tried. \n\n\n\nSome houses appear to be made of mud, with straw roofs and souls of women gabbing on the porches. They almost look alive, their heads clustered together and their hands clenched around the stems of kylix drinking cups, but they are transparent and misty. They are conceivable and can touch but appear less solid. \n\n\n\nLooking past them, a long road paved with dark cobbles winds to an imposing temple made of black marble. There is no light to reflect off it, making it all the more imposing. Eurydice, with all of her vengeance and fight, would not be down here with the matrons. She would be up there with Hades, either picking a fight or enjoying the afterlife with all she had. \n\n\n\nDead trees, charred with a black crust, are dusted with the gray ash falling from the sky. The smell of mold jams into my nose, making my stomach flop like a fish. I could vomit, but something told me it wouldn't make the anxious feeling go away. \n\n\n\nThree small dogs sit at the temple outside the massive arched doorways. I only see one tail wagging away, and all three tongues loll out of their slobbery mouths. I lean on my knees, wishing to absorb their cheery attitude through touch, but they roll onto their back... and there is only one small body. It is lumpy and a dirty tan color, with 4 petite legs, but it is only one. \n\n\n\nI rip my hand back, fear swallowing me whole, while the puppy rolls back onto his stomach. He seems happy to be getting any attention, even if that is born of fear. I tentatively pat his head and stand, pushing all my fear into a box in my chest. \n\n\n\n\"Good boy.\" He may be strange, but he is cute. \n\n\n\n     Inside this temple, pillars line the sides, some cut in half to hold dishes of fire, and piles of bones line the floor. The dingy lighting exemplifies the macabre scenery, with dead flowers on the giant stage-like steps like an offering. There is a large, spiky throne directly in the middle of this palace, with men and women so beautiful around it that the poets down here will never lack a muse. \n\n\n\n\"Boy,\" A dark voice booms into the corridor and echoes into my ears, \"You are still alive.\" Looking at the throne, a man more significant than even my father sits. He has inky black hair and pale skin, a long face, and sharp features. He isn't as muscular as my father; he looks lankier and more malnourished, but his spindly legs prove his height. \n\n\n\nI see Eurydice peeking out from behind the throne among the beautiful muses. \n\n\n\n\"I came for her. She didn't deserve death.\" I point at Eurydice, her blank expression morphing into one of disdain. \n\n\n\n\"You would even steal death from me?\" She asks in a shrieky tone. Hades silences her with a bony finger in the air, the pointy tip of his nail tracing under her chin. I don't feel jealousy as I do not love her but fear for her soul. He can touch them as if they are more than a mist, which makes him terrifying. \n\n\n\n\"You cannot take her. She is dead and therefore mine.\" He eyes her side profile with a malicious grin. \n\n\n\n\"I know. But she didn't deserve death. My father killed her for all the wrong reasons; I should be here, not her.\" I twist my words using my antics, and Hades has that same haughtiness as my father. He is colder, having basked in icy death, while my father was warmer from the hours of sun. \n\n\n\nHis gaze goes to the lyre I tucked around my leather belt, making the fear trickle out of its box. I untuck it from my belt, wondering if I can trade. \n\n\n\n\"I can offer this for her.\" It would seem acceptable on earth to trade something material for a literal living soul, but Hades changes the rules to serve him in his realm. \"It is a gift from Apollo, so it is made better than any earthly one.\" My voice cracks, feeling smoke curl around my legs. Looking down, my feet are still on the cold stone, but thick smoke covers them. \n\n\n\n\"One cannot trade a soul for a lyre. One needs a soul for a soul,\" He whispers, leaning forward with an outstretched hand. The room around me seems lighter, as if what is wrapping around my legs is the room's shadows. \"How far are you willing to go to make things right?\" \n\n\n\nI feel the shadows trickling up my thighs, cold and threatening. It travels over my toga, trapping the fabric in an airtight seal. The dust around the line of souls waiting for Chiron wasn't blown dirt; it was his powers keeping track of who traveled here. \n\n\n\n \"If I do this, will you allow her to return with no strings attached?\" With the gods, one has to be careful with how they word things. They are more intelligent than many mortals, leading to the myths our parents try to teach us to keep us alive.\n\n\n\n\"Yes. She will go back to earth, body and soul.\" His promise is followed by the smoke squeezing my wrists and forcing my hands to go cold. I drop the lyre from the pressure, hearing it clatter onto the floor. Smoke wraps around my bony shoulders and thin neck, menacingly sitting by my face. I gulp for air, but there isn't any left for me to take. No one down here needs it, so maybe I took all of the little amount for myself. \n\n\n\nMy heart is pumping. My teeth are grinding into one another. \"Send her back. Now.\" I demand, and I can see his lips tip up. He keeps me in my position, but with a click of his fingers, bright lights flood my vision and blind me. \n\n\n\n     The next moments aren't painful. The lights fade away, replaced by comforting black, until I can open them again. My hands jitter, my teeth unclench, and I look down. Everything on me is washed in a bluey-white. \n\n\n\nHades smiles, his arms opening me as if he accepts my soul. I look around, and the room is dark once again. My body isn't behind me as I expected it to be, but I don't feel the same sensations that I did when I was alive. I don't feel my chest concave with breaths or feel anything physical. \n\n\n\nIt's all gone. Everything that I once considered normal was gone. \n\n\n\n\"Thank you, Hades.\" I pick up the lyre and walk over to his stage. It's fitting for a theatrical God to have such a display for him and his prizes. I am now nothing but another trophy for another God, but it is different. He will admit that he doesn't love me and obeyed my will once, unlike my father, who never did it at all. \n\n\n\n\"I needed a musician.\" He muses, and I sit where Eurydice had once stood. I am away from the sun, holding something that I can do, and I am guilt-free. I am not paying for my father's mishaps, and the woman who loved life was back where she needed to be. \n\n\n\nSo, I string out a note, Hades smiles, and the other trophies begin a song. \n", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"57183703\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"soul transfer\", \"Victim\": \"Orpheus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Hades\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 57165361, "full_story": " \n\n\nEurylochus led a handful of men to the edge of the ship, signaling them to dive in just as a wave crashes against the wooden ship. The threadbare shirt he wore did nothing to protect him from the freezing water, but that was the least of his worries. \n\n\n \n\n\nHe quickly took count of the men and began swimming to the front of the ship, trusting the others to follow. He took in a deep breath, forcing his heart to slow down, and went underwater, following the faint glow in the distance. His eyes stung, but blinking in the salty water didn't help. \n\n\n \n\n\nHe pushed through the current till he came face to face with the source of the glow; a woman-like creature, with canines too long to be human and scaled green twin-tails that flapped in the water.\n\n\n\nHe watched the furious expression at being confronted transform into a more familiar face, \nPolites?\n, before he had his arms wrapped around the neck of the creature. Spines erupted along the tail, the siren thrashed, but he held steadfast, couting away the seconds till the figure stilled. He pushed upwards and thankfully gulped in the night air. \n\n\n \n\n\nHe waited a few sseconds, and the others too emerged from the water. He brought up the rear as they crowded near the ladder, waiting for Odysseus' next command. He could barely tell what was happening above deck, but through the broken reflections in the water, he pieced together the image of his queen, Penelope. \n\n\n \n\n\nHe drank in the sight of his best friends' wife for a few serene moments, memories of their family and him and Polites from before the war flooding his mind before the shadow of a man waved from the top of a ship. Eurylochus drew the knife, steeled his guts and dived once more. He focused on those sweet, sweet memories of his family as he cut the tails of the unconcious sirens floating near the ship.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nHalf an hour later, he stood on the deck, still shivering slightly as he removed the beeswax from his ears. Odysseus was stoicly staring out into the night sky, melodramatic ass that he was. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"So?\" Eurylochus asked the obvious.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"The lair of Scylla. That's how we get out of Poseidon's grasp.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nAnd just like that, all previous humour vanished. \"So, we do the impossible. Just another day then?\" \n\n\n \n\n\nOdysseus looked apologetic, but still nodded, unwavering in his decision. They stayed silent after that till the sky lightened ever-so-slightly to allow Eurylochus to make out Odysseus' thoughtful frown.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"You're quiet today.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Not much to say.\" His voice was gravelly, tired, but then again, whose wasn't? Eurylochus did not inquire further.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe silence grew, but Eurylochus could feel it growing closer, stifling him till he breathed out through his mouth and spoke up, \"I've got a secret I can no longer keep.\" \n\n\n \n\n\nThe guilt, of not just lies, but of all the blood on his hands, was squeezing, choking him. Odysseus barely looked at him, but his slightly tense body told him he was listening. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"I opened the wind bag while you were asleep.\" There. Those simple words for betrayal of trust of his closest friend. \n\n\n \n\n\nOdysseus just shook his head. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nAnger would have been better. Anger would have been appreciated. Eurylochus knew anger. He knew the blinding rage and hurtful words and stabbing pain and he knew to relish the soft, sharp hurt it brought with it. But dissapointment? The twisting in his heart it caused was worse.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"I'm so sorry.\" Eurylochus whispered. \"Forgive me.\" And Odysseus nodded and that was that. \n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus did not want to start to decipher the dark look in Odysseus' eyes, the strange hunger present alongside the familiar guilt of leading your own men to death. They sat silent once more, and Eurylochus felt the rising tension as though he was waiting for his verdict. \n\n\n \n\n\nOdysseus finally simply walked away, ordering Eurylochus in a cold voice, \"Eurylochus, light up six torches.\" He did as he was told, eyeing the way the flame raced up the liquid-doused wood and flickered violently. He handed them out to his own men, relishing the little warmth it provided. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe ship sailed on, and men came up and down the deck as guard duty shifts changed. Eurylochus lingered by the edge of the ship, eyeing the horizon once more. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Captain. Somethign approaches.\" A darkness that had nothing to do with the night towered in the distance, and Eurylochus' heartbeat sped up once more. \nIts just another battle\n, he thought to himself, gripping the leather-wrapped hilt of his sword till tiny crescent-shaped nail marks were permanently carved into it.  He met the eyes of his men around him, those holding the torches as well as those behind them.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Hello.\" The deep growl had Eurylochus' stomach curling, some ancient part of him telling him to run, to flee, to save himself. He stood his ground as the monster wailed, the voice echoing around the cave and giving the illusion of multiple beings. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Row.\" Odysseus shouted, eyes widening in fright. \"Row for your lives.\" \n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus repeated the words to those at the oars, and that shook then out of their trance. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"\nDrown in your sorrow and your fears.\n\" \n\n\n \n\n\nThe chill to Eurylochus' core had nothing to do with the wind. \"\nChoke on your blood and your tears\n.\" \n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus peered around the dark, both looking for and not wanting to find the speaker. \"\nBleed till you've run out of years.\n\" \n\n\n \n\n\nNo one made a single noise as they rowed, everybody stiller than they had been in the wooden horse in Troy. \"\nWe must do what it takes to survive\n.\" \n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus held his breath, Odysseus doing the same beside him. A sudden groan to their left was followed by the booming voice. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"\nGive up your honour and faith. Live up your life as a wraith. Die in the blood where you bathe.\n\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nEurylochus swallowed the sudden tide of guilt as the words hit his heart, but still, they seemed directed at Odysseus. He was looking into the darkness without fear, something even Eurylochus was reluctant to do. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nAnother groan in front of them, and Eurylochus ducked when something came out of the water and wrapped itself around the man to Eurylochus's right holding a flaming torch. The shrill scream pierced through the veil of darkness before the man was dragged underwater by that monstrous appendage. \n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus stifled a shout of terror and instead huddled closer to the floor. \n\n\n \n\n\nDemetrius, another one of his men, stood near him, holding the torch aloft. He bent and joined Eurylochus on the floor. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Extinguish it.\" Eurylochus ordered in a harsh whisper. Demetrius smiled sadly. The torch flickered in the dry summer wind, shadows bouncing around Demetrius' face creating the illusion of a watery grin.\n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus could see his steadfast eyes, though. The eyes of a man not afraid to die. \"I command it.\" \n\n\n \n\n\nDemetrius shrugged as well as he could while lying face down and holding up a torch. \"I'm sorry. We both knew this was long coming.\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"No. Demetrius I get that- Andreas-\"\n\n\n \n\n\nDemetrius held his spare hand up. The shadows looming just out of reach of the torch seemed to grow closer. A dread that had permanently taken up home in his mind grew once more. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"I may not see Andreas again, or Polites, but sacrificing myself for my crew, my king? Why, brother, that's the best kind pf death, isnt it?\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nEurylochus wanted to scream, to tell him to drop the torch in the water, to hold him down till he followed, but Demetrius got up, dusting himself off flippantly. Eurylochus could still see the slight tremble of his hands. \n\n\n \n\n\nBefore he could shout, could do anything, the stupid, brave man walked forward, steering well clear of the huddled groups of men. He waved the fire around, and the sudden focus of the monster on his person was palpable.\n\n\n \n\n\nDemetrius turned and met Eurylochus' eyes one final time, apologetic, scared, but so obviously relieved too. With tears in his eyes and a grin on his face, Demetrius raised the torch high like a flag, closing his eyes, water trailing down his face, as Scylla dragged him to the depths of the ocean. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe rest of his men carry the damning torch seemed to realise the inevitability of the situation and, much to Eurylochus' horror, by silent agreement, another man followed Demetrius' lead, offering himself up as easy sacrifice. \n\n\n \n\n\nBile rose in Eurylochus' throat. His gut threatened to turn, and he swallowed his nausea, sobbing silently. \n\n\n \n\n\nHe met their eyes each time in the dark, his sense of duty preventing him from dishonoring his men by doing otherwise. His eyes blurred, but he steadfastly looked at them, returning their small salutes with his own.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nAfter an eternity in the dreamlike terror, all the torches had been extinguished by water, and with it went all forms of light. Eurylochus was shaking. He huddled closer to himself, the overwhelming utter helplessness catching in his throat and joining the shame in his heart.  The swirling hurt and guilt expanded outwards and, as they emerged into the open night sky, sharpened into something red hot and ugly. \n\n\n \n\n\nOdysseus was at his side as always. His stricken expression melted into a blank mask as his eyes slid to Eurylochus', but he knew what to look for this time, and saw this too was an act for his benefit. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe sky outside was a slowly lightening blue, the setting moon turning the world to grey. Slowly, the men uncurled and got up, and those who had taken cover under the deck cautiously emerging up top. \n\n\n \n\n\nOdysseus offer him an arm up, and Eurylochus took it, probably gripping it too tight to be comfortable. He stared at the hollow eyes and tried to get the panic in his chest under control. \n\n\n \n\n\nWhat happened to you\n, he thought, running his gaze over the other man, scared to see someone he didnt recognise if he looked too close. Out of the two, Eurylochus had always been the harsher one. The carrot, the stick and the brains and charm. Polites, himself and Odysseus. He barely knew who any of them were anymore.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nEurylochus balled his fists, digging his nails in flesh. \"Tell me you did not know that would happen.\" \n\n\n \n\n\nHis voice mercifully did not tremble. Odysseus released his arm. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Say you didn't know how this would end.\" He was avoiding his eyes, Eurylochus realised, and it was like a bucket of cold water was dumped on his heart. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Look me in the eyes,\" he pleaded. \"And tell me, Captain.\" That dark gaze look turned to him, and Eurylochus felt spark that expanded into something big between them every second their eyes met. His breathing was quick, tear tracks drying on his face, but no fear, only the chorus composed of guilt and denial and his ever present anger. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"That you did not just sacrifice six men.\" His voice was a roar by the end. Odysseus calmly met hus eyes, but beyond his own reflection in the gleaming iris, he could see the crumbling walls and Odysseus desperately holding on to the same anger he was. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Use your wits and try and say I'm crazy and mad.\" The one time he would not mind being proven wrong by Odysseus. He was pleading his oldest friend, his brother and king. Fresh tears burned his flesh and left him bare in their wake, something raw struck as Odysseus refused to look away, both sensing the approaching disaster but stared, transfixed by the cracking of bonds forged through time and war and disaster and loss. \"That this is all some trick the gods have sent.\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Tell me.\" His voice broke. He continued despite the glass in his throat that cut him down from the inside with every word. \"That you did not miss home so painfully bad, that you gave up the lives of six of our friends.\" Eurylochus spit out the words with disgust, not sure if it hurt more to blame himself or to blame his brother.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nEvery second Odysseus remained silent, another part of Eurylochus disintegrated into nothingness till only a bitter husk remained. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"When we fought the cyclops, you were quick to hatch a plan. And when we fought Circe, even when I wanted to save ourselves, it was you who left behind no man. \"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"But when we fought this monster,\" \nas if they'd actually raised arms against Scylla\n, \"We didn't take a stand.\" He scoffed, trying to channel myriad of emotions through his words rather than his fists. \"You just ran.\" \nLike a coward\n, went unsaid. But not just a coward, no. He let their friends, the men who had followed his every word for ten years with full trust in his abilities to get them home, drop like flies to save his own life. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Say something.\" He yelled, voice rough with emotion.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"I can't.\" Finally, the man snapped.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nEurylochus uncurled his hand and curled it again around his sword, a gift from Odysseus that he had used to defend his king for years, and cut off the final part of himself still clinging to his soul. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Then you have forced my hand.\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nRuthlessness is mercy upon our selves\n. The words floated up through the swirling fire that were his thoughts. \n\n\n \n\n\nFine, then\n. He settled into a fighting stance, feet apart and sword pointed at Odysseus' bare neck. He could see a vein visibly thump under his skin. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Lower your weapon.\" The harsh words of someone who knew he would be listened to. Eurylochus went against every instinct screaming in his body.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"No can do. You miss your wife so bad, youd trade the lives of your own crew.\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Dont make me fight you brother.\" Odysseus frowned, but his hands still did not creep towards his own sword. \"You know you'd have done the same.\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"If you want all the power, you must carry all the blame.\" Eurylochus threw Odysseus' own words back, voice filled with venom.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nOdysseus did not raise his sword even as Eurylochus drew closer. A wave of distaste filled Eurylochus at the arrogance, and he finally attacked, sword swiping through the air where Odysseus had been a moment ago. The sound of a sword being removed from a scabbard rang and Odysseus dodged and turned, arms raised defensively.\n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus charged again, Odysseus parrying with relative ease. He pushed again and again, increasing the force behind each slash, his mind running through every trick in the book to find an opening. Odysseus did not allow him that, clashing swords till a bead of sweat dripped from his brow. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nTheir breaths puffed, but Eurylochus did not allow a moments respite, stabbing at his shoulder. Odysseus ducked and twirled, a leg hooking around Eurylochus'. He \ntwisted\n, and Eurylochus fell to his knees. \n\n\n \n\n\nHis heart missed a beat, but he recovered, tossing his own sword aside to wrestle the smaller man in the close quarters. \n\n\n \n\n\nA punch landed on his face, blood gurgling down his mouth, and Eurylochus smirked, teeth covered in iron red. He snapped his head, meeting Odysseus' cheek bones with a satisfying crack. To his credit, Odysseus did not yell, instead just backed away and finally, finally began attacking with renewed vigour. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThey traded blows back and forth, bloodlust in both their veins. Eurylochus grew desperate, his muscles cramping from the sudden activity. This man had built and torn down his entire life. He was at the centre of each moment in Eurylochus' existence, and it was only now that he saw who they truly were. \nMonsters\n.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nHe took a gamble, faking an attack to his shoulder. Odysseus' was quicker, running on pure adrenaline, and a well aimed blow had Eurylochus doubling over. The next second, a cool metal pressed against his throat, hard enough to sting but not to draw blood. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"I am not letting you get in my way.\" Odysseus said, drawing a line of red on his neck, and Eurylochus noticed Odysseus' eyes. Wild. Desperate. A dog squaring against a bear, losing all semblance of humanity till only the desire to survive remained. Eurylochus swallowed, throat bobbing against his sword. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nOdysseus was leaning over him, close enough for Eurylochus to smell the sharp sting of sweat and blood, the familiar scent of war. His eyes were hidden in shadow, a small cut on his cheekbone streaked red. He nodded his head ever so slightly as the sharp edge pressed harder, preventing him from breathing. \n\n\n \n\n\nBlood sprayed over Eurylochus first. Odysseus staggered backwards, eyes wide as his hands came bloody from his stomach. He looked at Eurylochus in horror, then behind him, at Gregory, one of Eurylochus' men, holding a knife dripping with his own blood. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"My brothers.\" He croaked, before collapsing to his knees with a dull thud. \"Why?\" The haunted voice whispered before Eurylochus quickly knocked his sword hilt against his Odysseus' temple. \n\n\n \n\n\nHis eyes closed, face relaxing, making him look much younger. Eurylochus stood, one arm holding his sword, and met Gregory's eyes. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Tie him up. We sail to the nearest land.\" The crew seemed uneasy, but no one argued. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nOdysseus came to with a groan. He tried to shield his eyes from the blinding light, sunsequently realising his hands were tied. He slowly opened his eyes, blinking rapidly till they adjusted to the midday sun. A dark shadow sat at his side, and Odysseus greeted his closest friend with a nod, regretting the decision a moment later. He groaned at a stab of pain. \"My head.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus merely stared at him, eyebrows furrowed but eyes cold. \"Where are we?\" He asked, looking around intrestedly at the picture perfect scenery. Blue skies, lush green grounds. A rocky beach and dense forest. A few men sat around in groups, looking out of place with their worn and dirt-covered clothes and weapons in the beautiful landscape. He thought he heard the mooing of a cow somewhere, but craning his neck to find it was also a bad idea. A much sharper pain pierced his side. A stab wound, hurting like hell but dressed in clean bandages. Eurylochus' work, if he had to guess. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Some island.\" Eurylochus replied, a distraction from the pain Odysseus readily accepted. \"The first one we could find.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's bursting with cows.\" Eurylochus added, frowning. A little redundantly, if you asked Odysseus. He could hear the mooing just as well. A cow strolled into view, and Odysseus raised his eyebrows appreciatively at the giant animal with soft eyes and shining white fur, before noticing the hungry look in Eurylochus' eyes as he considered the cattle before him. \n\n\n \n\n\nOdysseus' stomach growled as if on cue, though maybe that was just his insides trying to recover from the being stabbed. \"They are just roaming about. There are no people here. There's just so much meat.\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nOdysseus' stomach was empty, hadn't been completely filled in months, but their encounter with the lotus-eaters had taught him better. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Eurylochus.\" He said urgently. \"Don't. You know there is no way this ends well. We- our men could be die.\" Eurylochus snorted, and Odysseus had to admit the derision was well deserved. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Look, I'm sorry. But there was no other way.\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nEurylochus ignored his apology. \"There is no other food here either, nor is there anything in the ocean. We have nothing left. And hunger is so heavy.\" \n\n\n \n\n\nOdysseus' heart softened at seeing Eurylochus in pain for a moment, before his head thrummed, reminding him how he had been knocked out. The haze in his mind prevented any clear thoughts. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nEurylochus looked at him, shoulders drooping, before noticing something on his face and joining him on the grassy ground. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"You're bleeding.\" He said, pouring what was possibly the last bit of alcohol still remaining on his head wound. Odysseus hissed but did not move as Eurylochus wrapped a bandage around his head. He sat heavily beside Odysseus, leaning against the tree. He could maybe reach a knife on Eurylochus' belt, cut himself out, but his warning glare had Odysseus settling once more. He had no crew, no food. Not even a fully functioning body. Couldn't do much at the moment.\n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus' gaze returned to the cows milling about, and Odysseus could see him fantasizing eating them. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"There's really no one here?\" Odysseus asked; his turn to distract Eurylochus from doing something they would regret. Eurylochus regarded him for a moment. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Just a statue of the lord of the sun.\" He answered. \"Don't nt know where its from, but the cows seem attracted to it.\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nA warning bell sounded in Odysseus' brain, some legend about Apollo and cows that Athena had told him on a lazy afternoon as they relaxed after a lesson in his youth, but he could not, for the life of him, maybe literally, remember the foggy memories through his haze. He silently cursed Eurylochus.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nEurylochus got up suddenly, grabbing his sword and decidedly unsheathing it. \"Eurylochus, wait.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nThe larger man stilled. \"Please don't ont tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do.\" Odysseus said softly. Eurylochus turned to face him, and Odysseus could have sobbed at the look of pure devastation on his brother's face. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Ody, we're never going to get to make it home, you know it's true.\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nA piece of Odysseus' heart shattered. The defeat in Eurylochus' voice had his gut twisting. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"You don't know that's true.\" Eurylochus hunched further, but made no move to leave. \"This is the home of the sun god.\" He tried to argue.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"I'm starving my friend.\" Eurylochus said it so matter-of-factly, his voice devoid of any previous anger, that Odysseus flinched. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"If you kill his cattle, who knows what he'll send.\" He stated quietly. \n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus' dark eyes met his own. \"I'm tired, my friend.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"But we're so close to home.\" Odysseus pleaded, softly tugging against the ropes binding him. \"This can't be where it ends.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"You see a light at the end of the tunnel, Odysseus. I don't. No matter what, i am not getting Polites, my men, back.\" Odysseus swallowed roughly. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"How much longer must we suffer now?\" Eurylochus asked rhetorically, and Odysseus wished he had an answer. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Please don't do this.\" All he could do was beg. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"How much longer should we push through doubt?\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"I need to get home, Eurylochus.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"How much longer should I go about my life like this?\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Eurylochus.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"When people die like this?\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"We can get you home.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"I have no home left. Not anymore.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Eurylochus. I'm sorry.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"I'm just a man.\" Eurylochus said, and got up once again. The set in his shoulders was definite as he stalked towards his prey, and Odysseus tugged harder at his bonds. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe sun shining on Odysseus' face left him able to only see the dark silhouettes. Eurylochus' sword raised, and Odysseus shouted, \"Eurylochus, no!\", just as he brought it down with a powerful swing. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe red blood arced through the air, gleaming like stained glass against the sun midair, before splattering against the ground. The world hung silent for a few moments.\n\n\n \n\n\nOdysseus whispered in horror, throat parched, \"You've doomed us.\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nEurylochus looked back up at him. \"You've doomed us all, Eurylochus.\" He yelled, fury bursting forth like water through a dam. \n\n\n \n\n\nWhat had he done? \nI have to get back. To Penelope, to Telemachus.\n Odysseus thought distantly, and that single thought propelled him. He tugged desperately against the ropes holding him back, ignoring the pain it brought, and with a final crack, they snapped. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Captain?\" Eurylochus reproachfully asked, lowering his sword.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"We need to get away from this island.\" Odysseus yelled. Crashing noises came from deep within the forest, a deep groan as the earth below their feet shifted. \"Now.\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe cows ran about, panicking, but by some miracle the men avoided getting hit as everyone ran to the ship as fast as legs allowed. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Grab an oar with all the strength your arms allow.\" Odysseus reached the top of the ladder and hit the ground rolling. He clambered to his feet, approaching Eurylochus. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"These cows were immortal.\" He snapped. Eurylochus watched him with wide eyes. \"They were the sun god's friend.\" \n\n\n \n\n\nThe anchor was pulled up, and ship slowly got off the beach as the final line of trees crashed into the ground with a resounding crack. \"And now that we've pissed them off,\" Odysseus snarled, staring up into Eurylochus' horror-drawn face and shouting, \"Who do you think they'll send?\" \n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus took a step back. \"Full speed ahead.\" He yelled, officially wrestling back control of his men from Eurylochus' short reign. \n\n\n \n\n\nOdysseus' heart hammered in his chest, anticipation and adrenaline twisting and overriding all feelings. \"Faster\" he yelled, looking behind them for any signs of a threat. The sky around them darkened. \"Faster.\" The waves were beating against the side of the ship. Wind howled, and the smell of ozone reached Odysseus first. Thunder crashed, lightning blinding him for a moment before he realised there was someone standing in front of them. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"We're too late.\" He whispered, the throbbing of his brain loud in his ears, or maybe that was his heartbeat. One moment passed, the world remained frozen, and the next, all his men were standing behind the lord of the skies.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nOdysseus dropped to his knees, kneeling as he set his sights on the king of the gods' corpeal form for the first time. He still had nightmares about the rumbling voice from the last time they had met. He could not stop the building dread in his gut. \n\n\n \n\n\nZeus smirked at him, cruel eyes glinting. He held a lightning bolt in his hands, and Odysseus shivered under the mere presence of the weapon used to slay titans. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Pride is a damsel in distress.\" Began the king of gods. His voice like the rolling of thunder, the god miracled himself a huge, golden throne in the middle of the ship and settled into it, legs spread under the royal purple toga. Odysseus stood frozen, not daring to look away from the god in front of him. If it was any other time, Odysseus might have been in awe. As it was, he did his best to not move, lest he attract the famed wrath of Zeus. \"Hiding away where only I can undress her.\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe king cupped one hand around something in the air, and an ornate, silver goblet shimmered into existence. \"Try all she can not to confess. In the end, its all the same once I apply all the pressure.\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nOdysseus mused distantly why Zeus was telling him this. Was it a lesson, or a comparison. Was he being too prideful? He wondered. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nZeus looked away from his drink, apparently finished with the speech, and raised a surprised eyebrow at Odysseus still kneeling on the ground. \"Get up.\" He vaguly waved his ring adorned hand. Odysseus stood, knees creaking. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Tell me, Odysseus.\" Zeus rumbled. Odysseus would not have been surprised if his heart had stopped in that moment. \"If I were to make you chose; the lives of your men and crew, or your own. Why do I think they'll lose?\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nZeus took a sip of the golden liquid with a satisfied sigh, before tipping the goblet in Odysseus' direction. \"Enlighten me, king of Ithaca. Since hunger was far too great, I wonder who'd take the weight of the damned and suffer a gruesome fate.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\"You made a grievious error, son of Laeretes. You insulted the gods, my son, no less, and expected your act of crime to go unpunished?\" He asked, bushy eyebrows frowning incredulously.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Choose.\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Choose?\" Odysseus breathed out, voice shaky and tight with emotion.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Someone has to die today. You, or your crew? You have the final say, king of Ithaca.\"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe king looked back at him, deep blue eyes filled with dark amusement. \"So, choose.\" A slight smirk twisting his lips, Zeus gulped the rest of his nectar and sat back, eyes hooded dark with power. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"Please, don't make me do this.\" He begged, tears in his eyes. The same words he had uttered when given the choice to kill Hector's son or to never see his family. The first time, it had been his family or the child. \n\n\n\nNow, it was him or his men. \nI can't let them die, \nhe thought desperately.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nZeus said nothing, simply lounging on his chair, fingers trailing along the body of the lightning bolt. An immortal, all-powerful deity, forcing Odysseus to make impossible choices, for what? Entertainment? Some twisted feeling of power? Odysseus pushed the thoughts out of his racing mind.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nChoose? He could choose to save his own hide, to return to his dearest Penelope, to his sweet Telenachus, to go home and be happy? Or he could choose his men. The thirty six men who he had sworn to protect. Men who had given their everything to him for over twelve years, who were his citizens and his army and his family. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nIn the end, there was only one option.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nEurylochus' voice pierced through the darl veil of thoughts. \"Captain?\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I have to see her, Eurylochus.\" Odysseus begged him to understand. He wondered if the other man was thinking about the conversation between them and Polites after the first time he met zeus. How overcome by guilt he had been, how close to the tipping off the ledge. \nNow, look at the pair of them\n, he thought darkly. \nKillers. Traitors.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\"But we'll die.\" The quiet whisper would haunt him for the rest of his life. Odysseus looked away, not wanting to see the tears on his mens' face. \n\n\n \n\n\nEurylochus stubbornly stared at him, pulled his into the swirling darkness of his tearful eyes, and a thousand unsaid words passed between them in that instant. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"I know.\" He said, shaking with silent sobs. \nI know you'll die. I know you're sorry. I know I'm a monster. \nTears refused to stop flowing down his face.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nOdysseus was falling, and for the first time, he didn't know what to do. His heart twisted, guilt crashing down upon him in waves that had him shivering. He dug his fingers into arm, hard enough to provide momentarily relief, before a new wave of pain washed over him as he looked over the men who had followed him to literal hell. Tired eyes, broken figures. Not a single dry eye. \nI'm sorry.\n Empty words that would change nothing.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nZeus, seeming unaware of Odysseus' inner bdnd, sat up on his chair. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Well, this has been fun.\" He rose to his full glory, using the lightning bolt as a cane as he got to his feet, robes swishing under some unseen wind. \"I wish you luck, king of Ithaca. You will need it. Until next time.\" \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe king of the gods waved his hand, and the world disappeared around Odysseus.\n", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"57165361\", \"death_event_1\": { \"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"implied\", \"Victim\": \"crew\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zeus\" }, \"death_event_2\": { \"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"implied\", \"Victim\": \"crew\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zeus\" } } ```"}
{"work_id": 57137989, "full_story": "\"The old crone lies, my darling Semele,\" Zeus told her.\n\nAn unfamiliar sensation gripped his heart. It was named fear, and he felt shame, for that scourge was only for the torment of mortals, not the immortal gods, and certainly not the one who was the greatest among them.\n\n\"I am sure the crone is my jealous wife, Hera,\" he went on. \"She hates my mortal lovers and plots to ruin them and cause me pain. I have promised to grant you any boon, but do not ask this of me.\"\n\nBut he saw that Semele's mind and body were saturated with curiosity. She'd told him what the old crone had said: if she experienced Zeus's fire when he lay with her, she would become immortal and her son greater even than his father.\n\nSo she stared at him implacably. She'd boxed him in handily, exactly as the crone had told her. \"You must beg for a boon and then pretend to disbelieve that he will honor his promise. He will swear by the River Styx, and such a vow is unbreakable,\" the wrinkled old hag with the fathomless eyes had said.\n\nZeus went on, struggling to convince her to withdraw her demand. \"The fullness of my godly light and fire is many times greater even than that of Apollo, the sun, in his chariot at high noon. As you know, no mortal may look upon the chariot of the sun without burning out their eyes. You will surely perish if I come to you as I am on Olympus.\"\n\nSemele wanted the immortality the hag had promised Zeus could give her. \"On your son whom I carry within my womb, Zeus, I insist that you do as you promised. You swore on the river Styx, and nothing is more powerful than that, for everyone will cross it eventually, although mortals eons sooner than gods and titans.\"\n\nShe opened her robes, showing him her body, which glowed with the power of their son within her. Zeus knew he had lost to his clever wife. But he thought he might yet salvage something from this tragic situation. He covered Semele, and entered her, and let forth the full power of his desire.\n\nShe cried out in climax, but then his divine lightning struck, searing the land for miles around.\n\n~~~\n\nZeus wept tears as he carried the lifeless body of his lover to a pond where he might wash her and prepare her for her journey across the river he had sworn upon. She had been unable to withstand his glory, just as he had feared.\n\nThe presence of his son in her womb had protected her body from the divine wind and fire, but her eyes had been burned out of her skull, leaving only charred sockets. And even if her brain might have survived, her mind could not have.\n\nZeus washed her body, cleaning it of the ashes that had rained down on them as fire consumed the tree they'd been lying under.\n\nThen he turned to the gruesome task of opening her belly to rescue his son, whose mind Zeus could feel struggling for freedom.\n\nThe child was still incomplete, a fetus less than a handspan in length. His veins under the translucent skin resembled the grapevines that yielded wine, succor and temptation of men and gods alike. The mark of a panther's paw was upon his forehead. When Zeus severed the umbilical cord, a green gem took its place.\n\nThe next step was excruciating even to the greatest of the gods. Gritting his teeth, Zeus slit open his scrotum with a knife fashioned by Hephaestus from a ruby. So great was his cry of pain that an earthquake shook the island on which he sat with the dead body of his lover and his living son, who would be known as the twice-born. Tsunamis tore across the sea in all directions, swamping coastal cities and capsizing swift ships. Even Apollo, the sun, now riding far away to the west, heard the cry of Zeus and wondered what it meant.\n\nOnce he had his son safely stowed, he sewed up his organ of generation, using a needle made of sapphire and a thread unwoven from his tunic, and his tears of pain came to earth in a thunderous downpour, while branching lightning split trees across the island straight down to the roots.\n\nHis and Semele's son would be fed by the seed of his father before his second birth, and would thus count great powers of fertility among his blessings to bestow.\n\nZeus began climbing the great stairs to Mount Olympus, wincing with each step. He hurt now, but the immortals healed quickly. And it would all be worth it to see the look on Hera's face when she realized what he had done.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"57137989\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"burning\", \"Victim\": \"Semele\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zeus\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 57121198, "full_story": "Long before this tale a battle over a city took place between Wisdom and Sea. The Sea, jealous of Wisdom, fought for the city but was unable to take it within its grasp. Wisdom proudly took over the lands, naming them after her, where people prospered under her intelligence and creativity.\n\nMany years later a young girl joined Wisdom's temple to be a part of her priestesses as no man could enter her temple. Wisdom protected those girls and women from the men they could not escape for if they tried to enter she would smite them from which they stood. The young girl loved the temple filled with warmth and love from the other priestesses she met. Yet she was not whole, she longed for more a glimpse of hope or love but she knew she could never get it.\n\nDays turned to months and months to years, the girl grew into a beautiful young woman captivating the hearts of many but most of all Wisdom as she watched her from Mt. Olympus. The young woman was kind to all giving when she could and always taking care of the others at the temple. Wisdoms interest grew soon leaving her longing for a chance to speak to the young woman that brought light to her life. Little did Wisdom know that Sea was also watching the young woman noticing her beauty as well as Wisdom's interest in her plotting ways to make the young woman his.\n\nOne day Wisdom's dream came true as the young woman knelt at her altar alone. Wisdom went to meet this woman and how glorious she was, kind yet cunning, strong yet beautiful, she was everything Wisdom ever wanted and the young woman wanted Wisdom for herself as their love blossomed under the blessings of a certain Goddess. Sea's anger grew to a boil once he learned of Wisdom and her new found lover, hatred raised the sea to meet the lands of the city yet a flood did not come. Sea's plan grew and took shape as he traveled to Wisdom's temple for her lover.\n\nSea crashed into the temple filling it with water inducing panic in all those inside but Sea let the water seep back before it killed. Sea tore through faces before he found Wisdoms new lover, her face was struck with panic as Sea beckoned for her to come to him. She obeyed but only out of fear, kneeling before Sea, she pondered how she got here before Sea took her face in his hand pulling up to face him. The young woman knew of cruelty and lust yet never had she seen it like this on the face of Sea. The young woman knew of Wisdom and Sea's rivalry yet she never thought she would become a player in the obscene games they played.\n\nSea took in the young woman's face and how lovely she was before he pulled her up dragging her deeper into the temple. The young woman tried to free herself from Sea yet she was only mortal, weak against Sea's power.\n\n*****\n\nUpon the altar the Wisdom first met her lover Sea took to defying her as she pleaded for him to stop.\n\n****\n\nWisdom could no longer watch as she descended to Sea and her lover, Wisdom banished Sea from her temple taking her poor lover in her arms in protection. Wisdom called that Sea be punished for his deeds yet as he was Thunder's brother Posiden he went unpunished. Wisdom or Athena, as she was known fondly by the young woman, Medusa, decided to protect her lover by bestowing gifts of impenetrable skin, eyes that could see no matter the light, venomous teeth to bit her enemies, immortality in a sense, and talons that could perce anything. Athena made her lover deadly yet beautiful all the same.\n\nMesmerized Medusa looked at her reflection her hair fell softly around her heart-shaped face as her eyes glittered green with cat-like pupils her nails had lengthen and her skin was still pale yet took on a rougher texture she smiled then letting her now sharper teeth shimmer before kissing Athena in gratitude and relief that she did not abandon her. Then Athena told Medusa that if a man looked at her he would turn to stone god or mortal to keep her safe. Athena took her to a beautiful beach far away from any known lands where mortals and gods could not find her. They would spend days laying together on the beach building a lovely home of marble and olive trees.\n\nAthena would leave her lover for heroes that needed her help yet would always come back to Medusa. Years passed, a tale of a hideous monster that would turn everyone to stone spread through the lands as Posiden tried to sabotage Athena and Medusa's relationship. Many men were sent to slay Medusa only to be frozen in stone added to the lover's garden as decoration.\n\nOne day Thunder called Athena to Mt. Olympus to have her help his son defeat Medusa to claim victory and save his mother. Athena agreed to help the son yet not if it would kill her lover, Thunder angered by Athenas refusal claimed he would raise her cities spreading destruction and letting mortals curse her name till she faded from their minds. Athena was stuck, ending with her agreeing to help Thunder's son. She gave Thunder's son her shield with Hermes by her side to prevent anything that might deviate from Thunder's plan. Once Hermes went with Thunder's son she weeped for her lover's future, Athena could only hope that Medusa would live killing Thunder's son before he killed her.\n\nDays passed before Athena could visit her lover at their secret beach as she touched down upon the warm sand. Something wasn't right. Athena called for Medusa but only the breeze answered her calls. She searched for her lover only to come across her mutilated corpse, head cleanly cut off and slashes upon her torso. Athena fell to her knees crawling to Medusa's body cradling it in her arms as she cried. She cursed Thunder and his son for the death of her beloved if only she could have done something, anything to save her.\n\nAthena buried Medusa under their favorite tree in their garden of marble and olive before taking her place back upon Mt. Olympus, never offering help to any of Thunder's children again for the loss of her love. Thunder would tell the story of his son, Perceus saving his mother by beheading a disgusting monster that could turn men to stone with a glance and gifting it to her tormentor and his cronies. As well as how he saved a beautiful princess marrying her and spending their days together but never the love story of Athena and Medusa, lovers forever separated by the jealousy of Thunder or Zeus and Poseidon.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"57121198\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"beheading\", \"Victim\": \"Medusa\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Perseus\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"mutilation\", \"Victim\": \"Medusa\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Perseus\"}} ```"}
{"work_id": 56575177, "full_story": "Today is indeed the day.\n\nKlytemnestra sat in her usual seat, waiting for her handmaids to bring all her jewelry. She had already made the sacrifice to the gods so she was allowed to wear the gold crown and gold ring[1]. Besides, wearing something fancier on a big day like today would be understandable.\n\nIt was quite early. Helios had not yet ridden his horse-drawn chariot. Candles lighted up the palace. Klytemnestra put a candle on the table, it gave off a tranquil glow, helping Klytemnestra see her reflection in the mirror. The queen's dressing room was not as crowded as usual. Normally, handmaids would fill the room with their sweet laughter and soft footsteps. Klytemnestra always enjoyed these morning chats with her servants. She was not a rigid person--during these chats, she rarely spoke but often listened. Whether it was the rustling sounds within the palace or the distant sayings outside, she had a firm grasp on every whisper through this way.\n\nThis does not mean that Klytemnestra was easy-going--she was, after all, from a noble family. Such a person she was, the queen of Mycenae, the daughter of Tyndareus.\n\nThe palace had always been a quiet place. The servants were all well-organized. They came and went quietly when their masters needed them, with heads bowed and submissive attitudes, and never dared to disturb their masters. Anyone who witnessed the manner of the palace would undoubtedly praise the mistress for how well she handled everything. \"She has talents,\" they might have said, \"she will be a great ruler one day...If she wasn't a woman.\"\n\nA knocking sound drew Klytemnestra's attention. She lifted her head to watch the handmaids come in with their hands full of shining diamonds. \"Hope you have had a great sleep, mistress.\" The girls smiled at her and greeted her respectfully. They all stood still, waiting for Klytemnestra's orders. \"Thank you,\" Klytemnestra allowed them to come closer to help her put on all the garments and the sparkling crown. \"How are my children? Did Iphigenia wake up yet?\" Klytemnestra asked, something soft in her voice--she was a mother, and mothers cannot hide their love for their darling children. Some handmaids smiled gently, appreciating the queen's warm tone. One of the closest handmaids answered the question, \"They are doing well. The prince is still sleeping. Iphigenia has already woken up. She is getting dressed now.\" Klytemnestra nodded and let out a soft sigh.\n\n\"Are you worried about today's journey, my queen?\" As the dressing process neared completion, the handmaids held all unused pieces of jewelry and went back to their positions. Klytemnestra stood up, adjusting her gown one last time. \"They informed me that her future husband--Achilles, is a great warrior and a man with honour.\" Klytemnestra was ready to wave her hand, sending away the servants. \"I hope for the best. Tell Iphigenia to hurry up.\"\n\nThe servants signalled that they understood and they quickly dismissed themselves, leaving Klytemnestra once again alone in the room. Which is what she wanted. She needed some time to herself. As a mother, she was always proud of her children, especially Iphigenia, her eldest daughter. All the wonderful memories felt as if they had just happened, and yet her little girl was about to get married. Klytemnestra spun her golden ring with her fingertips unconsciously. She got emotional when she started to think about the future of Iphigenia.\n\nDays ago, Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, her husband, asked someone to send her a letter.\n\n\"Agamemnon sends a greeting to my Klytemnestra.\" The letter started with, \"I have some news you may want to hear.\" And that settled it--an arranged marriage for Iphigenia and Achilles. Klytemnestra did not mean to complain or dare to question the decision of the king but she did feel kind of lost. She thought at least she would have had a chance to discuss marriage with her children; she could have made a list of all those young, beautiful men around the country and picked the perfect one after some careful investigation. But Achilles, according to the old man who brought the letter, seemed to be a good man and indeed a good match for Iphigenia.\n\nAt least in this part, she felt truly happy for all this. Very well. She said to herself, \"I shall accompany Iphigenia, and I will walk her to her husband with joyful tears.\"\n\nOnce again, Klytemnestra heard some footsteps and the gentle sound of fabric rustling. She could not control the smile on her face, even though she had not yet seen who had arrived. \"Mother[2]!\" A voice as clear as crystal rang out, full of joy.\n\nKlytemnestra turned around to welcome her daughter. \"You look great, Iphigenia.\" Klytemnestra praised. \"Thank you, Mother,\" Iphigenia said happily. She looked a bit nervous, with her fingers pinching the clothes, but she was absolutely stunning in that deep purple chiton, and her long, curly hair went all the way down her back; some gold-made hair ornaments shimmered in the candlelight, adding a glow to her pale skin. Klytemnestra leaned in to adjust the position of a necklace for her daughter and then, with some reluctance in her voice, she said slowly, \"We have to go.\"\n\nThe carriage was prepared last night and is now waiting outside the palace. Klytemnestra took the lead and walked toward the gate, followed by her daughter and some handmaids who had been chosen by the pair to accompany them all the way to Aulis.\n\nThe carriage was dimly lit. Mother and daughter found themselves bored with few things to do. \"Have some rest, my daughter, if you are tired.\" Klytemnestra noticed how Iphigenia had yawned several times. Normally she would not allow this to happen--how can a well-educated, noble lady be so relaxed? But she was willing to make some exceptions for now, as she could not imagine when she would be able to see her dear daughter like this again. \"I know the time is early; the black-robed goddess just drove her chariot across the sky.\" Klytemnestra softly patted her daughter and encouraged her to lean against her shoulder. The carriage continuously rumbled along the road, not quite steady but somewhat hypnotic, especially in the darkness of the night. Iphigeneia shook her head. \"Thank you, Mother. But there is no need. In fact, ... do not blame me, Mother. May I ask for some information about my...future husband?\" A faint blush appeared on her cheeks, hard to notice in the darkness.\n\nKlytemnestra smiled and said, \"Of course. I will tell you what I know, for this is a good match, I believe, and this will not be too inappropriate for you to know.\" Then, Klytemnestra began to describe this mysterious Achilles, whom she did not even have a chance to meet for herself. \"Your father spoke of him often. He is one of the best warriors on our side, for he has great strength in both his mind and body. The fertile Phthia is his home, the well-known king Peleus is his father, and the water goddess Thetis is his mother. Such a nobleman he is that I am truly satisfied with this marriage, even though it was arranged by your father instead of me.\" After hearing her mother say that, Iphigenia felt relieved. Her heart beat fast, and she cannot help but begin to anticipate her marriage.\n\n\"I am just so delighted, my daughter, that you do not have to worry about any harm that will come to you.\" After all the silence, Klytemnestra suddenly spoke again, with a low and soft voice, almost like a whisper. \"I am sure Achilles will protect you. May Artemis protect you for now and Hera will guide you in your marriage and household, my dearest daughter.\"\n\nFor a moment, she seemed profoundly sorrowful, and Iphigenia keenly perceived that.\n\n\"What happened, Mother?\" she asked cautiously.\n\n\"...It was something before your father took me as his wife. But that is something a young lady like you should not ask about.\" Klytemnestra gazed up at the sky, trying to determine what time it was and how long it would be until dawn. \"Yes, Mother. Please have some rest as well.\" Iphigenia sensibly stopped asking and leaned to the side, falling into sweet dreams.\n\nUnder the pale moonlight, Klytemnestra watched her daughter rest, her chest filled with pride. \"I have raised her well,\" she prayed silently with all her heart--may the gods bless her and keep her safe from harm.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter travelling for a long time, they finally arrived at their destination. The sun had risen. Klytemnestra could see the sea now, vast and deep, stretching endlessly. The surface of the sea shimmered with reflected light, adding some golden glitter to the deep blue. The weather was great, and the sea was calm.\n\nKlytemnestra smiled. This was a good omen. The gods all rejoiced at this marriage.\n\nAulis was the place where the Greek fleet gathered. This place was supposed to be the departure point for the Greek army but for some reason, they stayed here longer. At least longer than Klytemnestra had expected. With that being said, Klytemnestra did not concern herself with the matter.  It wasn't her place. She had only one task here, and for this task, she was willing to take the risk of being here in the army with soldiers.\n\nThis was certainly not an ideal venue for marriage. Thus, Klytemnestra was more worried about Iphigenia, her young innocent daughter.\n\nAgamemnon had already sent servants to welcome their carriage. These servants surrounding the carriage helped the royal family get out of the wagon. Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, was waiting here too. He looked strangely\nin pain, with his brow furrowed and the corners of his mouth turned down. How surprising! Klytemnestra thought to herself. The king did not look full of happiness like a normal father, especially since he was the one who planned the wedding. Some pleasant laughter rang out behind Klytemnestra. Iphigenia, unaware of her mother's thoughts, rushed into her father's arms. \"Oh, Father[3]! How I missed you!\" Agamemnon opened his arms and caught his daughter tightly. He found himself smiling too. \"My dear daughter, I missed you too,\" he said.\n\n\"That's wonderful! I'm so happy to be with you and keep you company.\"\n\nThe king lowered his eyes, avoiding the gaze of his family. \"Perhaps,\" he murmured.\n\nKlytemnestra had been amused by their daughter's adorable little gesture, but then she couldn't help but fall into contemplation. Agamemnon let go of Iphigenia and started walking toward Klytemnestra. \"I hope the trip was not too boring and exhausting,\" he said in a hushed voice, with a faint smile. \"Lord Agamemnon,\" Klytemnestra bowed to him. \"We have come here and followed your commands, with hope and excitement.\" Then she turned to her handmaids, who waited nearby, and asked, \"How is Orestes? Bring him to his father.\" Soon the maids brought the young prince. Orestes was too small to notice anything; he was wrapped in warm and soft fabric. When seeing the face of his father, whom he had not met for quite a long time, Orestes waved his fists; a big smile on his face. Just as if he was aware of the upcoming wedding.\n\nDespite this, Agamemnon still looked weary and sorrowful. \"How are you, Father?\" Now even Iphigenia had noticed that something was wrong. She grasped her father's arm and asked worriedly, \"Is everything alright? I hope you are doing well with all the soldiers, for I know the condition here can't compare with what our home has.\" There was a look of concern in her eyes--such a sweet little girl.\n\nThere was a moment of silence. They were both waiting for Agamemnon's response. Agamemnon took hold of his daughter's hand; he gazed at his family members, and his tone carried the perfect blend of tenderness and sorrow. \"Forgive me, my daughter,\" he turned to Klytemnestra and added, \"I am sure your mother understands me--how can a father not be sorrowful when his dearest daughter is about to get married into another family? I have not seen you, my precious, in a while because of the war. When will I see you again? This I do not know.\"\n\n\"Then,\" there was a bright smile blooming on Iphigenia's face, like a flower in bloom. \"Please forget all the troubles, Papa. I will accompany you as long as I can.\" The smile on their daughter's lips was so beautiful, and Klytemnestra realized that she was also beginning to grin. \"Very well!\" Agamemnon looks relaxed as he is comforted by his daughter's warm words, \"But do have some rest now, my daughter, for you have travelled far.\"\n\nSome servants stood silently by, upon hearing the king's words they stepped forward and took the initiative to lead the princess to the house.\n\n\"Goodbye for now, Mother and Father.\" The young princess bowed to her parents and then followed the servants. Orestes was with his sister right now and she carried him into the house. Even the horse-drawn carriage was taken care of and all the dowry Klytemnestra prepared was taken by some servants into the house.\n\nThen there is only Klytemnestra there with Agamemnon. A silence fell between the two of them. Klytemnestra stared at her husband, wondering if he had any other orders. Agamemnon went silent for a while, and then he walked a few steps toward a more distant, secluded area and gave her a sign, asking her to follow.\n\nAgamemnon was not always a talkative person, or he was, but not always with her. Honestly, Klytemnestra did not care. Their marriage could hardly be counted as a happy one, for she had no right to choose. What was even worse was how Agamemnon brutally murdered her real husband and son--he messed up everything precious to her and then, as a reward for winning the fight, she became a prize for him. But Klytemnestra was a Greek woman with a sharp mind, she knew how to stay in line. She managed the house carefully; she knew what to say to comfort Agamemnon. She gave birth to her children for him and the happiest moments she had were watching her children grow up. This was the light of her mundane life, and she prayed that their lives would be whatever they wanted.\n\n\"I am sorry, Klytemnestra,\" the king's voice woke her. \"...Please follow my words. ...I will be in charge of the wedding ceremony. You should have some rest instead.\"\n\n\"...What?\" Klytemnestra widened her eyes, unable to believe what she had just heard. \"I will follow your command at all times, but I do not understand. How can a mother be absent from the wedding of her daughter?\"\n\n\"You'll see.\" Agamemnon stood with his back to her; his clothes looked meticulously neat and his voice sounded cold. \"It is not suitable for my wife to be around all my men.\" \"But then Iphigenia will be here alone, with the same men!\" Klytemnestra almost laughed at the absurd request. \"No, my king, I will not abandon Iphigenia here. I will hold the wedding torch and I will accompany my girl. Unless our customs and piety toward the gods are no longer important to you.\" Agamemnon remained silent; Klytemnestra could see his clenched fist.\n\nThe silence continued for a while, then the king finally spoke, \"Fine, woman. Do what you want!\" His voice trembled slightly, which gave Klytemnestra a flash of confusion. However, she did not have time to think about it carefully. She turned back into the house to be with her daughter.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe house was warm. Iphigenia and Orestes had already laid down, preparing to rest. Seeing that Klytemnestra had finally returned to the house, her daughter grabbed her hand and pleaded with her to stay. \"Please have some rest too, Mother. You are tired, I can see.\" \"Do not worry about me, my daughter.\" Klytemnestra gently ran her fingers through her daughter's hair, tidying it up for her. \"Mother will stay here with you. Now close your eyes, because there will be many things to do when you wake up.\"\n\nAfter ensuring Iphigenia had fallen into a deep sleep, Klytemnestra walked back outside, gazing at the endless blue sea and enjoying some breeze from Euripos through her delicate hair. The breeze blew away some of her unease. Ready to ignore the strange way Agamemnon behaved earlier, Klytemnestra resolved to prepare for her daughter's wedding with full enthusiasm. Agamemnon was probably too nervous about all this. Klytemnestra murmured to herself, \"Me too. This is the process everyone has to go through, but that doesn't make it easier to accept\". She sighed.\n\nThere were some footsteps near her. Klytemnestra turned to check, only to find that the other person seemed to not have noticed her. He was a good-looking man, with armour and weapons--he was a warrior, undoubtedly. More importantly, he looked like one of the best. The man seemed to be startled by her presence. \"Sorry, I did not see you,\" he said, taking a few steps back, respectfully not looking at Klytemnestra. Before Klytemnestra found a chance to speak, an old, hoarse voice suddenly spoke up. \"Our noble mistress, the Queen of Mycenae,\" an old man hurriedly approached them, \"please wait.\" And then he recognized the man near Klytemnestra. \"By the gods! I did not know you were there too, Achilles.\"\n\nBesides the call of the old slave, Klytemnestra was surprised--she took a closer look at this man and tried to join her hand with Achilles. \"Child of the goddess, daughter of Nereus, you are a noble man--let us join our hands and rejoice! For we\nwill soon be a family, after the wedding.\" However, the son of the goddess looked confused; he seemed to know nothing at all, which made Klytemnestra uneasy. \"It would be completely wrong for me to touch what I shouldn't touch.\" Achilles simply turned around and decided to leave directly.\n\n\"Wait, the descendant of Aiakos.\" The old slave stood in front of them, breathing heavily. \"I have some unfortunate news for my mistress, the daughter of Leda and Tyndareus--for I am your slave, my mistress; your father gave me to you when you married Agamemnon, and I stayed and will stay loyal to you.\" He stopped Achilles with respectful yet determined gestures. \"This involves you too, the child of the goddess.\" Upon hearing these words, Klytemnestra felt her heart tighten as if a hand had squeezed it. She turned away slightly, not daring to hear what the old slave had to say. \"I know you. Your loyalty is unquestionable. ...Please speak.\"\n\n\"There will not be a wedding, my mistress. Our king wants the princess to be there because...\" Klytemnestra anxiously twisted the ring on her finger, and she quickly urged, \"Please, go on.\"\n\n\"...Because he plans to kill your daughter and sacrifice her to Artemis.\"\n\nFor a second, her mind went completely blank. She struggled to stay on her feet. Klytemnestra stared at the old slave intently, trying to detect any trace of dishonesty in his words. Nothing. The old slave was telling the truth, and deep down in her heart, she knew that.\n\nNo. No, no, no, no.\n\nHow could it be?\n\nThis could not happen. There was a sound echoing in her ears; it was her heartbeat, beating faster than ever. Her fingertips were as cold as ice. Klytemnestra closed her eyes, trying her best to figure everything out. Although she was not so intimate with her husband, she knew Agamemnon was not a madman. She tried to calm herself, but the overwhelming sense of panic and loss nearly constrained her throat.\n\nAchilles stands silently behind her, seeming skeptical of all this. \"How could he possibly do that? Kill his daughter?\" \"What are you talking about?\" Klytemnestra says it with a cold tone. Her voice was full of anger. \"Don't you dare say that to me! I demand that you leave.\" There were tears in the eyes of the old slave; his voice sounded slow, with a depressed tone. \"I was always loyal to you. Even more so than to the king. I have watched the young princess grow. It is with great sorrow that I talk about this.\"\n\nKlytemnestra closed her eyes, preventing any tears from falling. \"Tell us everything.\"\n\nThus, the old slave spoke, \"The Greek army is gathered and ready to go for the war against Troy. Yet, our lord accidentally offended the goddess, the mistress of the woods and animals, the proud daughter of Leto, Artemis, with her golden bow. The goddess demanded our lord make a sacrifice; at least our seer Kalkhas said so. As for the wedding between the girl and the child of the goddess, it was meant to be a disguise. So that you, daughter of Tyndareus, would happily bring the poor girl with you, all the way from Mycenae to Aulis.\"\n\nKlytemnestra could no longer hold back her emotions. Everything had been prepared; there seemed to be no way out. Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. No human can suffer such pain--the mother is forced to be separated from her child permanently. Klytemnestra covered her face in a desperate attempt to wipe away all her sorrows, but it was pointless.\n\n\"I apologize.\" She tried her best to look better but failed. \"Alas! How can I hold back my tears, my poor daughter and I! Fate has been cruel to us! It was my husband's fault and his brother's problem, yet our daughter is the one to pay for the price!\" Clouded by her own tears, Klytemnestra heard Achilles's sigh. Like a tree hit by a bolt of lightning, she suddenly realized something: \"Achilles, you are the child of a goddess. You are indeed from a good family--a family nobler than mine. I pray that you may help us, for it is your name that my husband used to deceive us.\"\n\nNo man could stand the suffering in her voice. This was the sound of a broken heart. Yet the child of the goddess, swift-footed Achilles, didn't answer right away. For a moment, he seemed to be lost in thought, and then, with seriousness, he replied, \"Do not worry, daughter of Tyndareus. I am willing to help in every way that I can. Although I don't know if I could truly make a change--Agamemnon is the leader, after all. I was looking for him; once I see him, I will talk about this with him.\"\n\nHis words gave a glimmer of hope to Klytemnestra, yet her heart still ached terribly. The child of the goddess quickly left. As the leader of the army of Myrmidons, he had many responsibilities to his people.\n\nKlytemnestra stood by the seashore for a long time, with only the old slave for company. The once-bright scenery of the beautiful Euripus seemed to have lost its colour. She took a deep breath, hoping to calm herself down so that her unfortunate daughter would not worry about her when she went back to the house. Unexpectedly, Klytemnestra encountered her husband on her way back to the house. Filled with anger and a sense of betrayal, she quickly caught up with him. Agamemnon was perplexed by her unusual behaviour.\n\nHe stopped and faced his wife. \"Is everything all right?\" Klytemnestra wanted to speak, but as soon as she opened her mouth, tears began to fall. \"I am here to ask you, my king.\" Agamemnon looked confused, but his lips pressed together, and his gaze shifted to the side.\n\n\"Ask whatever you want; I will always answer.\" The king replied.\n\nNow I get it. Klytemnestra thinks to herself. How could I not have realized this earlier? It was obvious.\n\n\"Do you, or do you not, intend to kill our daughter? Kill the child we raised and loved for all these years.\"\n\nHer voice sounded calm. Despite all the tears, Klytemnestra continued to stare directly at the king. Agamemnon looked shocked. His eyes widened, but all of a sudden, he looked pale and depressed, as if all his energy had drained away. \"So, you have heard about that.\" His reaction said everything.\n\n\"How can you let this happen? It is our daughter whom you want to sacrifice. How can I, as the mother, witness all this?!\" \"Calm down, woman!\" Agamemnon became somewhat enraged, his voice turning hoarse. He could not bear to be accused by his wife. \"I tried to warn you! I sent the old slave to give you a letter, but he failed. Now soldiers have all heard about the sacrifice--they are angry and demanding that I do it sooner! How am I able to go against them all?\"\n\n\"How can you not? This is your daughter and now you are about to kill your own daughter with the knife in your hands! What kind of man would have a heart like this?\" After a moment of silence, Klytemnestra continued quietly, \"You had taken my child before and now you are about to do it again.\"\n\n\"You do not understand,\" said Agamemnon. \"I am with the Greek army. This is the only way to resolve the matter.\" The cold words of Agamemnon disappointed her, yet she was more clear-headed than ever. She watched in silence as her husband hurriedly walked past her without further words.\n\nI knew you would be like that. Klytemnestra felt frustrated. When she finally returned home, her daughter was already awake, smiling at her as usual.\n\n\"I hope you had a good rest too, Mother!\" She greeted her mother with warm words. Klytemnestra tried to pretend everything was fine but she found it impossible. The moment she saw her beautiful and caring child and heard that gentle, happy voice, her tears flowed down her face like a breaking dam. The sorrow was too deep. She held her daughter tightly in her arms, which amused Iphigenia. \"What happened, Mama? You scared me.\" Although she knew nothing, Iphigenia opened her\narms and hugged her mother. \"Do not worry, I will be there with you.\"\n\nYet, to her surprise, Klytemnestra held her even tighter, just like holding a treasure. The queen was reluctant to let go of the embrace. Who would have thought--she hugged all her children so many times in the past years, but at this very moment, she felt like it would never be enough. Iphigenia wiped away tears for Klytemnestra: \"Pray tell me, Mama. What happened? Did something happen to Father?\" Klytemnestra smiled weakly at Iphigenia, trying to offer some sort of comfort.\n\nShe did not know how to tell her daughter about this terrible, tragic fate. Her young girl had just come into her own, like a blossoming flower. There would have been a bright future. Klytemnestra had hoped for a happy marriage for her daughter, unlike the one she had--now this thought seemed like a joke. \"I do not know how to tell you, my child.\" Klytemnestra pressed a kiss on Iphigenia's forehead and said, \"Woe is me! What can I do to protect you? Your father is going to do something terrible! The Greek army wants to make a sacrifice to the divine daughter of Leto.\"\n\nSpeaking those words drained all her strength. Klytemnestra could not look at her daughter, for it would break her heart, though it had already been torn apart. Instead, she hugged Iphigenia desperately. Iphigenia did not speak a word for a few seconds. Klytemnestra noticed that the young girl was confused at first, but then suddenly understood everything.\n\n\"My daughter!\" She cried. Iphigenia was silently shedding tears; her rosy cheeks were now pale as death. \"Mother, I cannot bear to leave you! I cannot bear to leave this world and enter the dark realm of Hades. I love the bright sea, the brilliant sunlight, and the lush trees. I beg you, Mother, do not leave me alone!\" The mother and daughter embraced each other and wept bitterly.\n\n\"Mistress,\" a servant came in, interrupting them, \"there is a message from the child of the goddess, daughter of Nereus.\" It was Achilles. Klytemnestra stood up in a panic. She eagerly asked the servant what the news was. \"He said--all the Greeks are against me. There is just no way.\" Having heard such awful news, Klytemnestra felt distraught. She had expected this. Achilles was indeed a good man. He did not need to get involved in the first place.\n\nKlytemnestra sat back down, overcome with distress. But then the worst happened. There were many noisy voices outside the house. They sounded Greek. Soldiers had gathered in front of the house, demanding to see the princess. Iphigenia softly took her mother's hand, seeking comfort from her mother. Her palm was moist with tears and Klytemnestra could not help but tightly squeeze her daughter's hand. Someone entered the room; it was Agamemnon. He silently gazed at his daughter and wife.\n\n\"Father...\" Iphigenia cried, \"Please do not do this to me!\" However, Agamemnon looked away. He dared not look at his daughter. \"I am sorry, I am so sorry, my dearest daughter...but the Greeks forced me to do this.\n\nThey would kill all of us, all the family members, if I did not do this.\" Klytemnestra spoke up, \"But you are the commander! You are sacrificing our beloved daughter for someone else's unfaithful wife and for the sake of your brother's affair. How would you think that this is a fair trade? Gods shall not permit such acts to happen unless they have made another arrangement.\" Such a woman she was, even the king could not meet her eyes directly. The queen continued, \"I would take my daughter's place if it is possible. A mother should do anything for her children and I only wish for her well-being-\"\n\nAgamemnon sighed, \"Daughter of Leda, please do not say that. Have you forgotten your duty? You should head back to Mycenae, for there are other children for you to take care of.\" The king of Mycenae said this to remind Klytemnestra of her position.\n\nNoises outside the house grew louder, and Agamemnon wept as he spoke to his poor Iphigenia, \"My dearest daughter, the Greek soldiers are waiting, growing increasingly impatient. As for me, I would never want you to sacrifice yourself. I, just like your mother, love you as well.\" Agamemnon approached Iphigenia, wanting to take his daughter's hand and hug her. The young girl looked surprisingly calm now. She asked her dearest father if this was truly the end; there was no other way out. \"If that is the decision you have made for me, dearest Papa, then please allow me to speak a few more words with my dearest Mother.\"\n\nKlytemnestra held onto Iphigenia with such strength, afraid that if she let go, she would never see her daughter again. \"Do not weep for me, Mother. This is my fate, and at least I hope I will be able to help our soldiers. Do not forget me; always remember my love, the deepest love a daughter could have for her parents. Take care of my brother and sisters.\"\n\nAs the words fell, Iphigenia kissed her mother for the last time and she stood up to follow her father out of the house. Klytemnestra tried to shout out Iphigenia's name but the words got stuck in her throat. She struggled to grasp her daughter's wrist but failed.\n\nIphigenia glanced back at her one last time, \"Farewell, my dearest Mama.\"\n\nThe immense grief engulfed Klytemnestra. She wanted to follow her daughter to the altar but found every drop of her strength had left her body. She could no longer cry, for there was only a hollow inside her. Her body was shivering and her fingers were all cold. She feels immediately sick. She can still recall the warmth of her daughter's hand. Everything in this room reminds her of Iphigenia.\n\nHow can I live when I go back to Mycenae? How can I travel with the horse-drawn carriage, the same carriage we used when we first came here? I should have asked Iphigenia to stay in the palace... Klytemnestra stayed in the house for hours, with nothing to do but reminisce about the memories of her daughter. Agamemnon came in once to demand she go back home. The king had already put on full armour, so Klytemnestra knew it was time to leave this place.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKlytemnestra had been ruling the kingdom for nearly a decade.\n\nPeople were willing to recognize her as the new ruler since Agamemnon had gone to war. But she was a woman after all--therefore she needed support from other royal members, particularly Aegisthus, the cousin of Agamemnon. For a long time, their collaboration had been peaceful and uneventful. However, there was always a plan in Klytemnestra's mind. She had been thinking about this plan for ten long years, biding her time. She was the daughter of Tyndareus and Leda; she certainly was a clever woman who knew how to hide her emotions. And Aegisthus barely participated in making decisions. He was exactly the one Klytemnestra needed.\n\nAfter all this time, the gods handed her a perfect chance.\n\n\"Victory belongs to us!\" Klytemnestra turned to her people and announced the delightful news to them. \"Our king, my husband Agamemnon, sent us the message through Hephaestus' flame. Each beacon carried the fire from Ida[4], all the way to the house of Atreus.\" People began to cheer and celebrate, and some started crying.  Everyone had been waiting for this moment for so long.\n\nImmediately after the announcement, a sacrifice was arranged. Sheep and (Sleek heifers[5]) were prepared, waiting for the queen to start the ritual. Women were all following Klytemnestra, as they brought the woven peplos for the goddess. Aromatic wines were poured into the cups and ready for libation. People were excited. Klytemnestra tried not to recall that sacrifice that had once pierced her heart. She couldn't even stand by herself and face the whole ritual at that time; but now, she was watching animals get ripped apart[6] without any hesitation.\n\nShe won't let anything similar to that happen again.\n\nAfter the celebration ended, Klytemnestra turned back to the palace, asking servants for details for a specific task: \"How are my children?\" A part of her heart trembled at this word. My children. She forced herself to stop thinking about it. Very soon someone respectfully replies, \"To the daughter of Tyndareus, queen of Mycenae, they are doing great and have settled down in the places you chose for them.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Klytemnestra, with satisfaction. This was the first step of her plan. She needed to send all their children away from the palace, probably for a few months, to ensure their safety. The rest of the plan could wait until Agamemnon returned from Troy.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKing Agamemnon returned a few weeks after people received the news. He went back with so much glory that everyone was proud of him and the Greek army. Klytemnestra bowed to him, showing respect and love with all the luxurious candles and tapestries. Of course, she did not really mean that; these are the gifts tainted with hostility. She nearly sneered openly.\n\nThere was another girl--Kassandra, brought with Agamemnon from Troy. The king commanded servants to treat her as a guest, so Klytemnestra greeted her herself. She neither envied nor resented the girl. She was just curious--how would this 'war prize' react, after she fulfilled her plan? No one could understand the words of this former princess of Troy, so soon enough she was left all by herself in the palace. Klytemnestra took her leave to continue accompanying the king.\n\n\"My king, you must be tired.\" Klytemnestra smiled gently at Agamemnon and guided him to the bath. \"Please have a rest and take a bath!\" Agamemnon looked surprised and pleased; he was more than happy to be led to the bathhouse by Klytemnestra.\n\n\"The water is ready,\" Klytemnestra said, feeling a surge of excitement. Her hands were trembling slightly and her heart beat rapidly. She tried her best to conceal it, hoping the king would not find out. And--one, two, three. Now was the time! Klytemnestra quickly wrapped the king in a robe--a robe that was so tight and not convenient to take off. Agamemnon appeared shocked and confused, but he did not have a chance to ask.\n\n\"In case you are wondering, this is for Iphigenia.\" Klytemnestra did not miss the fear in Agamemnon's eyes, even though it lasted for only a short time. The king began to grasp what would happen to him. His pupils shrank in fear as he struggled within her trap. But it was too late. Klytemnestra raised her weapon with the enjoyment of vengeance. The weapon, which she had hidden long before Agamemnon arrived.\n\nThen...\n\nShunk, Shunk, Shunk...\n\nThree sounds of stabbing and a long sound of howling. Agamemnon lay heavily in the bathtub, blood staining the entire pool.\n\n\"...and you,\" Klytemnestra says, turning around and finding Kassandra. For some reason, the girl appeared here, witnessing the scene of the murder. \"Give me a reason not to kill you.\" Klytemnestra casually wiped the blood off her clothes and skin, and then tightened her hand on the weapon, \"For you are from my enemy's side.\"\n\nSurprisingly, the former Trojan princess laughed. She did not look at Klytemnestra; instead, her gaze was fixed on the dead body, and she seemed to mutter some words quietly: \"...now my duty is truly done. I have made my revenge, though through another woman.\" Then she walked towards Klytemnestra, with the flames of madness burning in her eyes, \"I have seen all--at least I will die with the satisfaction of revenge!\"\n\n ...\n\nVoices slowly gathered on the other side of the door; the court elders must have heard the commotion inside the bathhouse.\n\nKlytemnestra calmly lowered her weapon. Her mind wandered, recalling the old memory of when her daughter was taken away for sacrifice. Back then, the only thing she knew was how to cry.\n\nI have to find Aegisthus, Klytemnestra thinks. That would be the final step of the plan--he will be the new king, but I will be one with the real power.\n\nShe glanced at the two bodies on the ground, and a small smile appeared on her face.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n[1] Women are not allowed to wear gold jewelry or rouge... in some temples\n\n[2] Meter\n\n[3] Pater\n\n[4] Ida Mount?\n\n[5] Book 6, Iliad\n\n[6] Blood sacrifice, thysia", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"56575177\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"stabbing\", \"Victim\": \"Agamemnon\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Klytemnestra\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"Kassandra\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Klytemnestra\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 56574667, "full_story": "He had another. She knew. It was impossible not to when he smiled like that.\n\nHow sad was it? That she had come to associate her husband's smile and happiness with his cheating?\n\nBecause she knew, she followed him, in the death of the night, to a mortal's house. She refused to call it by its name, the stalking, as she watched them talk.\n\nSoon it became apparent, he had been seen this human the whole month, they wouldn't be that close otherwise; and she --the mortal, Semele-- knew he was him, knew he was Zeus.\n\nWhen he cheated on her with a mortal, they either did not know who he was or they knew, but they only stayed together for a few days, a week at most.\n\nThis change in routine meant trouble for Hera; this could mean that he was ready to replace her, find someone better --someone like Amphitrite, someone who doesn't take revenge on his lovers, who cares more about the advantage such union gave her than the meaning of it--.\n\nThe normal punishment --on the lover, on their children-- would not suffice, she needed to send a message, make him realize --no matter how many he found-- only one would remain. He could only have her. This one had to be harsh, off-putting; he had to be the one to do it, to suffer the consequences.\n\nSo she stayed and waited until he went back up to Olympus, then she started talking.\n\n\"How do I know he is Zeus?\", she said in the mortal's head. \"What proof did he give me to know he is a god, a king, the king of gods?\". The way it was phrased, the mortal could only think they were her own thoughts. \"There is a way to know\", she told her, \"If he swears on the river Styx to never hide anything from me, then I ask him to show me the real him, he will have no option but to do so\".\n\nShe tapped into magic, amplified those thoughts, erase all will to question them and what they entail.\n\nShe looked at her work, smiled and left. Zeus has in for a little surprise.\n\n\"You promised!\", his lover screamed.\n\n\"I know, I know, but please understand why I mustn't\", he begged. He could not help but hiss as his skin started to burn from breaking his new oath. He shouldn't have sworn, he knew better than to do so.\n\n\"Do it!\". He shouldn't. He knew this was not her, she was not like that. Alas, there wasn't another option.\n\n\"Forgive me, Semele\", he whispered and closed his eyes. He let her see him, with all his divinity, for only a second. Unfortunately, humans were far more fragile than he had ever cared to notice. He refused to look at her corpse, intensely burned in some places, completely raw in others.\n\nHe amplified his senses to detect all life forms in the area, hoping his aura did not reach outside the house. Then, he felt a faint life in front of him, it could not be her, it had to be...\n\nHe knelt at her side and put a hand on her; it wasn't her, it was something inside.\n\nHe took a shaky breath and did what he had to without acknowledging it.\n\nSoon, but far too late for his mind, he had the demigod in his arms. It had not grown enough, and there was only one thing, one magic spell, he knew could help in this situation.\n\nHe sat down as the weight settled inside him. Took a minute, and left the house. Sooner or later a neighbor would find Semele and prepare her funeral, there was no point in staying there anymore.\n\nHe only left a note, \"Cause of death: divine aura, accident\".\n\nHe should go back to Olympus, but could not bring himself to do so, not at the moment. He needed rest and to process... All that.\n\nSo he flied to Crete, to his mountain, to his cave. It was smaller than he remembers, but he was small back then.\n\nHe gave a satisfied sigh at the sight of his old belongings, they weren't many, but they were his.\n\nThe once too large blanked now fitted perfectly as he settled down for a nap.\n\nShe did not see her husband until three days after Semele's death. She had gone down to her house after Zeus had been gone for one too many hours. She watched as the neighbors prepared the funeral, as they discussed a strange note that had been left there --obviously from the god-- and the odd burns on the house interior walls.\n\nWhen he came back, she knew something was wrong, too wrong. He tried to hide it, and did it fairly well, but there were things everyone could notice. How defensive he was. How tired he was.\n\nThey had another fight, that was... Not good, but common, routine, safe. Except it wasn't, normally neither would cry, rarely she would cry --out of anger--, now he did --but he did not look mad, but sad--. And he fled the room, fled Olympus.\n\nHe did not come back until a week later. And all he said was \"You did it, didn't you?\" with the more apathetic face he had ever made. That's all he said for the rest of the month, refusing to talk outside of meetings if she was in the room.\n\nApollo tried to check on him multiple times, but he refused to. Ares began following him around the palace, claiming to be \"his bodyguard\"; he did not seem to mind it too much. Poseidon and Hades tried to talk to him, to get to know what was going on, but could only get him to admit he needed a hug or help with something --sad enough, that was more open than usually--.\n\nThen he disappeared again; Hermes claimed to have found him, but that Zeus refused to go back and preferred if no one knew his location. He went back and forth, from Olympus to the secret location, during the day --when Apollo was too busy to follow personally-- in the shadows --where the sun could not follow him-- and constantly changing the route --making it too complicated for Iris to deduce where he was headed--, and gave them Zeus' orders to maintain Olympus afloat while he was gone.\n\nMonths later, he came back.\n\nActed like nothing had happened, which only worried Poseidon and Hades more, though they did not express it verbally.\n\nRefused to talk about it, if she brought it up; if Hera name-dropped Semele he looked at her dead in the eye and refused to elaborate.\n\n... At least she had gotten what she wanted, he was no longer open with any lovers --which did not mean he had any less, in turn, he had more and more and barely stayed a day with any of them--. Yes, he did not talk with her either... But it did not matter, right? They were never close like that, why would it matter?\n\nMovement at her side woke her up. Her husband was rolling in his sleep, clearly disturbed. Concern filled her mind as she tried to calm him down, then to wake him up when that did not work.\n\nHe talked in his sleep \"Please, please, Semele, you know I... I cannot do that, please, I beg you\". She froze at that. She knew it had affected him, that was the whole plan, to affect him so much he would not dare find a replacement.\n\nHe started to cry, tears falling as he tried to stop the memory. He suddenly awoke with a scream. She hug him as he continued to cry, taking his hair in his hands and not looking at her, but pass her, like he wasn't in his room.\n\nShe rocked him back and forth and whispered reassurances in his ear.\n\nWhen he managed to calm down enough to notice where he was, he just pushed her away. \"Do not touch me\", he said.\n\n\"Is everything okay?\". They turned around to see Ares in the doorway, his words meant he had just arrived but how he was standing --hand loosely holding his spear instead of firmly griping it-- made her think he arrived there at the initial scream.\n\n\"Ares\", the king said, \"do me a favor and help me get to Poseidon's, I have to talk with him\".\n\nTheir son went back to \"bodyguard mode\" saying \"As you wish, father\" while giving him a military greeting.\n\nShe stayed there, asking herself when did they fall apart.\n\nThe next years went by as the ones before them, with him cheating and she getting revenge --always making sure he wasn't there to see it--.\n\nHe either stopped having nightmares or stopped sleeping altogether as, no matter how late she went to sleep or how early she arose, she could never catch him at nighttime.\n\nTheir talks went back to normal and everything was as if the incident did not happen.\n\nThen, the rumors of another child of Zeus appeared; an ascended demigod.\n\nShe ignored it at first, she had learned the bad way not all the mortals that proclaimed themselves to be children of Zeus necessary were. Some just thought the pros of being one outweighed the cons, some were demigods of other deities but thought only the king had demigod children for some reason, some were just playing.\n\nBut she did ask, \"This 'Dionysus' claims to be your son, is so true?\". The only thing he responded with was, \"He is the son of Semele, only that I will tell you. Don't you dare touch him.\"\n\nHe left her again, this time as she tried to figure out how that was possible.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"56574667\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"burning\", \"Victim\": \"Semele\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zeus\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unspecified\", \"Victim\": \"Semele\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zeus\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 56417806, "full_story": "It is late afternoon, early summer. I stand by the cliff overlooking the harbour of Knossos, where a large flotilla of fishing boats and ships have assembled. The priestesses sing hymns; offerings are made. At last, I raise my hands to bless the fishermen down below us, their boats and nets, ensuring that they will have plentiful catches of fish.\n\n\"All hail the living Goddess of Kaphtor,\" they gratefully shout up to me. The rites have gone well. I am pleased.\n\nThe priestesses and I walk the short distance back to the palace, the House of the Double Axe.\n\n\"Will you be taking your evening meal in the caves again this evening, my Goddess?\" a maidservant asks. I nod. We do not speak of the reason I go down there, to be with my son. But she understands.\n\nAs I begin descending the stairs toward the cave entrance, deep underneath the palace, the weariness of the day departs from me. My heart beats with joyful anticipation. My woman-flower moistens.\n\n* * *\n\nI am the living Goddess. I am Pasiphae.\n\nI am Goddess and Queen: my word is law on this blessed island of Kaphtor; no one may gainsay my wishes.\n\nI am Goddess and Queen, yet I must hide from my people the thing that most gives me joy. As though it were a thing of shame. I refuse to be ashamed: I love my son. Though he be called a monster. Though my love for him is not the chaste love of a normal mother.\n\nI am not normal. I am the living Goddess. I am Pasiphae. My divine body burns with sacred desire for him, for my Asterion. Though he be called a monster by the people of Kaphtor, though he must be kept hidden away, imprisoned in the caves beneath this House of the Double Axe. To me he is perfect. He is beautiful. He is my delight.\n\nHe is my delight, from his strong bull face, with his sad, tender eyes, down to his mighty hooves, that stamp the ground impatiently as I approach his chambers. (He can smell me coming, even before I enter the caves.) Yes, his head and legs are those of a bull; but his chest, arms and buttocks are like a man, though covered in short, coarse bronze-coloured fur, flecked with patches of ivory. I love to run my fingers through his fur, feeling the powerful muscles rippling under his skin, as he pounds into me. Yes, there is one other part of him that is magnificently bull-like. No woman but I can fully ensheathe him, down to his testicles. No phallus but his can satisfy me. We were made for each other. Or rather, I made him for myself.\n\n* * *\n\nWhat divine inspiration was it that led me to lie with his father, that magnificent White Bull of Knossos? How did I know that my womb could accommodate him, when no other woman's could?\n\nI was then in the first flower of womanhood. It was just a year after my mother, the old Queen died, and the spirit of the Goddess passed to me. In the preceding years, my chubby girlish body had blossomed. Between my legs, a thick carpet of silky black hair had appeared, from my navel back to the furrow between my buttocks. My hips and thighs flared out wide and full; my breasts grew heavy, my belly was soft and plump. I was ready for marriage. My counsellors advised me to take Minos, son of the Cypriot Queen, as my consort: it would establish friendly relations between our two islands, they said. I followed their counsel. But Minos could not satisfy me, and his seed was thin as water, with a foul smell: it had no life in it. He gave my womb no joy, and no child grew in it. After a few months of this, I ceased to lie with him. I could give myself more pleasure with my own fingers. I could adopt some suitable girl to be my daughter, to succeed me as Goddess. Minos has remained king; I saw no reason to humiliate him and offend Cyprus, by deposing him. Since those days, we have not spoken much to each other.\n\nOn Midsummer Day of that same year, I walked out into the fields with the priestesses, to bless the herds and flocks with our dancing. The White Bull stood out from the other cattle as the full moon stands out from the stars. The priestesses all noticed him; they commented on what a splendid bull he was. But I -- I could not take my eyes off him. I returned the following day, alone, to watch him: something drew me.\n\nThen I saw him mounting the cows. I saw that glorious phallus emerge from his shaggy underbelly. The sight of it inflamed me, so that I could think of little else. How fiercely I envied those cows! Nectar dripped down between my thighs. The White Bull sniffed the air, then looked directly at me. As though he could see into my soul.\n\nI returned again the next day, late in the afternoon. He allowed me to approach him; he seemed curious, almost amused by my presence. I offered him some figs from my hand, and he ate them, his thick tongue licking my palm. He let me caress his brow, his horns, his muzzle, his powerful neck and shoulders. His gentleness moved me; his beauty and power aroused me. He sniffed the air again, lowering his head, bringing his nose near to my lap.\n\nIt was now after dusk: the herdsmen had all gone home. I removed my skirts, wondering how he would respond. To my delight, the Bull immediately shoved his muzzle between my thick thighs - snuffling with his hot breath, nuzzling at my shaggy pubic nest, licking over my engorged woman-flower, lapping up my abundant nectar there.\n\nThere was a large boulder nearby, shaded by a myrtle tree. I bent over the boulder, offering the Bull my body, presenting my fat rump to him the way the cows do. Again, he shoved his muzzle into my furrow, licking over my anus, over the petals of my woman-flower, with his thick hot tongue. He pressed the tongue-tip between them, deep into my sheath. But I was greedy for something even bigger and harder.\n\n\"Please ... mount me!\" I begged.\n\nDid the Bull understand my plea, or was he about to do it anyway? I will never know. He reared up, placing his fore-hooves on the stone above my shoulders. And then, delirious with joy, I felt that enormous, thick phallus slide into my woman-sheath, filling me up, knocking the air out of my lungs. I had been close to orgasm from the Bull's licking, but now I immediately came. And I kept coming as the Bull drove deep into me over and over again, splitting me open, repeatedly punching my cervix with the head of his phallus. Had I been a slenderer woman, his pounding might have shattered my pelvis. But my hips and belly were amply cushioned, well able to absorb his thrusts. At last the Bull gave a great bellow, shuddering. I felt his phallus twitching deep inside me, as he flooded my womb with his hot, potent seed.\n\nHe withdrew, and the thick seed poured out of me, splattering on the boulder beneath me, puddling on the ground. He nuzzled my shoulder and licked the nape of my neck, licked at my armpits, a gesture of deep tenderness. I sat up, turning towards him. I kissed his muzzle.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I wept gratefully. He snuffled, as though returning my thanks. I hugged his warm neck. At last, I refastened my skirts and hobbled back to the palace, buoyed up on a cloud of euphoria, my inner thighs coated with his sticky seed.\n\nI was so sore the next morning, I could scarcely walk; but the soreness was delicious to me, reminding me of my sweet tryst with the Bull the night before. I bathed for several hours in asses' milk, and by late afternoon I was mostly recovered. As dusk fell, I went out to the fields, to meet my Bull again.\n\nThis went on for many days. Rumours reached my ears, that some herdsmen had seen us. But I took no notice. I am the living Goddess. I am Pasiphae. I need not blush at rumours.\n\n* * *\n\nOne evening I went out to the field, but he was not there. Discretely, I asked my maidservant Rhea about the White Bull. Word came back that King Minos had offered him in sacrifice. I quaked with rage and crumpled in despair, but I could say nothing. For the king to sacrifice such a magnificent animal, so everyone thought, was an act of great piety; his behaviour could not be faulted. Not without publicly confirming the rumours.\n\nFor over a month, I shut myself away in my chamber, drowning in grief. I became ill with it, my belly began to swell with it, or so I thought. My maidservants grew alarmed.\n\nBut the High Priestess examined me and shook her head. \"It is not grief that makes your belly grow, my Goddess. You are with child.\"\n\nAs the months passed, my belly swelled up till the skin was tight as a drum. My maidservants constantly rubbed olive oil into it, to keep the skin supple, fearful that I would burst open. Never had they seen such a heavy pregnancy, they swore. Toward the end, I could not walk without their assistance.\n\nMeanwhile, everyone congratulated Minos on getting me with child. He said nothing to disconfirm his fatherhood, nor did any of the palace servants, though they knew very well that it had been nearly a year since Minos had shared my bed.\n\nThe day came when my water broke, and the contractions started. No other woman could have done it, but my woman-sheath, that had allowed the White Bull of Knossos to impregnate me, now stretched to allow the birth of his son. The midwife recoiled in shock as she reached in to draw out the crowning head -- not a human head, she found, but that of a bull-calf. At last, he fully emerged, making high-pitched grunts rather than cries. The midwife cut the cord and laid him at my breasts. I was exhausted with the labour, but joyful to hold my child. Joyful as well that he bore some of the features of his true father. I fell in love, instantly, deeply, completely, with his sweet bull-face, his fur-covered but human-shaped body, his adorable little hooves.\n\n\"Asterion. He shall be called Asterion,\" I panted.\n\n\"But ... is it not for King Minos to name the child, my Goddess?\" asked Rhea, unsure how to react to this monstrous-miraculous birth.\n\nI shook my head fiercely. If I conceded to Minos the power to name him, he could instead order the child to be thrown from the cliffs. Rhea was giving me a way out, thinking that I would want the \"monstrosity\" quietly disposed of, to put this sordid affair behind me. How little my maidservant knew me.\n\n\"He is Asterion. I, Pasiphae, have spoken.\" Like a she-bear protecting her cub, I hugged him tightly to my bosom.\n\nAsterion's little bull-muzzle rooted for my nipple and latched on, drawing forth milk from my breast. A fog of drowsiness descended upon me. I fell asleep, grateful to be suckling my precious new-born son, comforted at last after the loss of my White Bull. I now had Asterion to live for.\n\n* * *\n\nOthers were not so happy about Asterion's birth. No one spoke to me of him except in the most euphemistic and indirect of terms. I saw that my people were embarrassed by Asterion. Their lust-addled Goddess-Queen had lain with a beast of the field, obviously, and consequently given birth to a horrifying monster, half-man half-bull. What were they to think of that? I am their Goddess: they may not rebuke me; they may not question my behaviour. It was easier for them to pretend the whole thing never happened. As long as I kept Asterion from public view, their manner toward me was warm and respectful as before. But when I spoke with motherly pride about Asterion's childish accomplishments - learning to walk, to eat solid food, and so on -- I felt their cold disapproval.\n\nI had never experienced this sort of treatment before, and it did not please me. I could have railed at them and threatened curses. My angry words might have made them fear me - and hate me. But I wanted their love, their reverence, which could never be won with harshness, I knew. I am their Goddess and their Queen, but that carries with it great responsibility as well as great power. They are my people, my worshippers, and I must take care for their well-being, just as I must take care of my precious son. I cannot run roughshod over their feelings.\n\nAnd so, Asterion was kept away from public view. As he grew, my servants hinted that perhaps the best place for him was in the caves beneath the palace.\n\nIndeed, he grew much more quickly than a human child. A bull matures in two years. Asterion did not grow quite that fast. But certainly by ten years of age, he was full-grown. To my sorrow, he never could learn to speak. Whether this was because his lips and tongue were not shaped for human speech, or because he could not think in human language, or some mixture of the two, I cannot say. Often he makes a sound, like \"hmmagh-hmmagh\". I think perhaps he is trying to say \"mama\". He seems to understand some of my words, or perhaps the gestures that accompany my words. But even without language, Asterion and I understand each other, perhaps more deeply than most humans do. There is a look of bright intelligence in his eyes. He knows how deeply I love him. Of this I am certain. Just as I know he returns my love.\n\nHe likes to spend his days making things: a chair, a goblet, things of wood or things of clay. There is skill in his fingers, and his wares are quite beautiful. I often give them as gifts to the priestesses and other officials. His creations are much sought-after in Knossos. I do not say who made them, but they know. Sometimes he makes fantastical figurines, with absurd faces that make me laugh. It pleases him, to make me laugh. It helps us forget that he is, by general agreement, imprisoned in these caves. There is no lock upon the entrance, but he knows he must not leave. His chambers are comfortable, of course. He is provided with all that he needs. The servants leave his meals by the entrance. He takes normal human food, neither the grass and straw that his father ate, nor the human flesh that some ignorant gossipers whisper about. I ordered shafts to be cut in the caves' roof, to allow in sunlight. There is a spring-fed pool in one of the chambers, in which he can bathe. A separate channel was cut to carry away his wastes. Sometimes after dark, we stroll together outside, so he can take in the fresh air. As long as we keep well away from other people, there are no repercussions.\n\nMy duties as Queen require me to spend some daytime hours away from my son. But I spend nearly every night with him. I cannot sleep, apart from him.\n\n* * *\n\nI know my son's body intimately. From his infancy onward, it was I who bathed and dressed him. From month to month, from year to year, I saw him grow to manhood - if that be the right word. I saw him shoot up, to a stature much taller than me, taller than most men. He put on muscle. His strength is prodigious. I would love to see him pit his strength against the men of Kaphtor in the sacred games: I am certain he would win them all. But alas, for him to move about openly among the people of this land -- that is a wish I will never see fulfilled.\n\nI am the living Goddess. To whom can I pray, to whom can I turn with the deepest supplications of my heart? I can pray to my divine Self, but that brings me no consolation. Instead, I pray to him. I worship him. Asterion is my God.\n\nFrom his brow, horns grew, that remind me keenly of his father, the White Bull. And I saw the boyish waterspout between his legs grow into a magnificent bull-like phallus, another potent reminder of his father. Perhaps it is even a little bigger, I cannot be certain. In those all-too-brief times when the Bull and I were together, I was always so impatient to have him inside me, I never got a good close-up look at that instrument of my pleasure. With Asterion, however, I can examine and admire him to my heart's content. When erect, it is longer and thicker than my forearm, from my fingertips to beyond the elbow. I know: I have measured it.\n\nHe grew into adolescence. As I washed him, or as I hugged him or caressed him affectionately, as any mother may do with her son, his phallus would emerge from its hiding place, becoming fully erect. The first few times this happened, the look in his eyes was still that of a child, though his body seemed nearly full-grown. I patted his sweet phallus affectionately, then kissed his cheek, to let him know his erection was nothing to be alarmed or ashamed about. Gradually, the look in his eyes changed. It was replaced by a questioning look, unsure what to make of the strong new feelings arising in his heart and his body. Then a begging look, pleading with me to do something to relieve these feelings. In time, he would guide my hand down to his phallus, and I would pat it affectionately, as I had often done before. But now, he would put his hand over mine, holding it there. I would grasp his strong phallus with my fingers, though only partially: it is too thick for my fingers to fully encompass it. He would snuffle with happiness when I did this. Even more so when I stroked my hand up and down the shaft. It is one of the few parts of his body that is not covered with fur, and I love the feel of his bare skin there. A rivulet of seed often dribbled down from the tip.\n\nBy this time, the look in Asterion's eyes was no longer that of a child. There was desire there, such as I had seen in the White Bull's eyes. I could not behold that desire in his eyes without being deeply moved. In truth, the desire in his eyes, and the sight of his phallus, the bare-skin feel of it in my hand, the smell of his seed from its tip -- these all inflamed my passions. As with the White Bull, I soon could think of little else. Nectar welled up in my woman-flower, flowing out between my thighs, and he could smell it. He grunted, questioningly, longingly: \"hmmagh-hmmagh?\"\n\nWhen this happened, I would pull my hand away. I would sit a little further away from him, attempting to subdue my own growing desire. I tried to reassure him that I was not upset with him, that he had done nothing wrong. I caressed his brow and horns. I kissed his cheek. Strong as he is, he could easily have forced me to do what he wanted. But he always accepted whatever limits I set. His phenomenal strength is matched by his utter gentleness; this makes me love him all the more. The question was, could I abide by those limits myself?\n\n* * *\n\nOne evening as we reclined together, instead of guiding my hand to his phallus, he dipped his head down and took my breast in his mouth. I had not suckled him in years, and it brought back a flood of sweet memories. I cradled my dear son's head in my arms, stroking his brow and horns as he continued to nurse, switching from one breast to the other, licking my hard nipples with his thick, hot tongue. There was no milk in them, nevertheless my heavy breasts seemed to comfort him. His mouth felt so good on them. Instinctively, I reached out and began stroking his phallus. He huffed with pleasure. Between my thighs, I was wet as Knossos harbour.\n\nYes, I thought, this is what my son needs. He is ready for it, and no other woman can give it to him. I too am ready - more than ready. Ever since the birth of my miraculous son, everything had been leading toward this blessed moment. I could fight it no longer; I did not want to fight it. I am crossing a line, I recognized, beyond the normal love of a mother for her son. But I am not normal. I am the living Goddess, I am Pasiphae.\n\nI rose to my feet, watching his reaction, as I unclasped the girdle that held up my skirts. They dropped to the ground, and I stood naked before him. He had often seen me naked before: we frequently bathed together. But this, he knew, was different. Asterion looked at me in wonderment, his eyes bright with emotion.\n\nThat first time, I had to show him what to do. My son had never seen a bull mount a cow, nor a man lie with a woman. I motioned for him to lie back on the bed. I straddled him, guiding his daunting phallus between the petals of my flower. Then I slowly sank down on it. It took some determination - surely he is even larger than the White Bull! - but I was able to take all of him, down to his testicles. Back into the place he came from. He did not last long the first time. Neither did I.\n\nAfterwards, we both wept for joy, holding each other, kissing each other, as I sucked his thick bull-tongue into my mouth. At length, I laid my head down on his powerful, furry chest, feeling the mighty heart beating within. Thank you Asterion, I fervently prayed to my God.\n\nBut just like a man, he promptly fell sound asleep.\n\n* * *\n\nLying with Asterion is quite different from my times with his father. The White Bull did what he wanted with me, and I happily let him do it. With Asterion, there is an intimate back-and-forth. Show me mother, his eyes always seem to say.\n\nThat does not mean he is passive. He has learned that I love for him to mount me and ravish me like a cow in heat, just as the White Bull did. This he does very forcefully. He enjoys playing with my fat, wobbly buttocks as he pounds into me from behind, kneading them with his powerful hands. His father could not do this: he had no hands, only hooves.\n\nMy son loves kissing my buttocks, licking them, licking the deep hair-lined furrow between them, licking over my anus and my nether lips, sometimes for hours on end, making me come again and again, till I can take no more. Sometimes I gush fluids as he licks me, and I drench his face. I was embarrassed by this at first. But he seems to love it when this happens. He loves the taste of my nectar.\n\nI love his taste too. Ever since he began having erections, I had longed to take him in my mouth. I could lick along the length of his shaft, I could suck on the very tip, as I stroked him with my hand. He seemed to love this. He squirmed and huffed with pleasure, then erupted, splattering his viscous white love-potion all over my face and neck. But how was I to take him inside my mouth? Initially, I could barely get the thick head past my lips. My jaw ached, trying to open wide enough. But he tasted delicious. I was determined: if my womb could accommodate him, so would my mouth.\n\nIn time, I learned to relax my lips, jaw and tongue, and I found I could take the whole head in. I feared I would not be able to breathe, but soon I realized I can breathe through my nose. As the head slid into the back of my throat, I felt a need to cough -- a sort of choking sensation. But I meditated on the sacred Snake who guards the House of the Double Axe: She swallows her prey whole, and I am She, I am the living Goddess. I learned to keep calmly breathing through my nose, relaxing my mouth and throat, swallowing him into my gullet. At last, I was able to take the full length of him, till his heavy, warm testicles rested on my chin.\n\nOnce we reach this point, I bob my head up and down, letting his phallus slide in and out, just a handbreadth or so. Invariably, this quickly leads to him coming, filling my stomach with his copious seed. It is a delightful way, I find, to conclude our love-making for the evening, before we drop off to sleep in each others arms. I love having this mighty man-beast under my spell, like putty in my hands - or rather, in my mouth. I love to have him whimpering, huffing, bellowing with gratitude at the pleasure I give him this way. It is one of the ways I worship my God.\n\n* * *\n\nI reach the end of the stairway. I can hear him stamping behind the door. I step through it and immediately he takes me in his arms, lifting me off my feet. He kisses me, open muzzle to open mouth, my little tongue duelling with his massive one, with a little more passion than usual.\n\n\"That was a lovely greeting, my son. But you may put me down now.\"\n\nHe pays me no heed, instead carrying me straight to bed and setting me down on it, pulling off his kilt and loincloth. He is fully erect already.\n\n\"My, you certainly are eager this evening!\" I laugh. \"Will you not show me what you worked on today?\" That is usually how we start our evenings together.\n\nBut tonight, he seems to have other plans. He throws back my skirts, diving his head down between my thighs, lapping up the wetness he finds there, snuffling and huffing with excitement. I grip his horns, using them to steer his tongue towards my hard little nub, the centre of my pleasure.\n\n\"Oh yes, right there. Oh my sweet sonnnnn! Right there. Ahhh, I'm ... cummmmnnnnnnnffff!!!\" I cry out, splashing his face with my nectar. But he does not let up. One of his thick fingers invades my anus. Immediately, I come again, wailing and thrashing about. Still he does not let up.\n\n\"NO! Stop!\" I say severely, closing up my thighs. He backs off, afraid he has upset me.\n\n\"Hmmagh-hmmagh?\" he grunts.\n\nI stroke his muzzle and smile at him, to let him know I am not upset. \"If I let you,\" I shake my head at him, \"you will keep licking your mama all night long. But I want you inside me now. In my anus. I have been fondly remembering the last time we did it that way. And you seem so eager tonight: I want to give you something special.\"\n\nHe understands nothing of my words, probably, or very little. I get up to find the butter dish, and hand it to him. His eyes go wide, and he snuffles with excitement. This he understands.\n\nI pull off my skirts and bodice, kneeling at the edge of the bed, face down, assuming the cow position.\n\nAsterion is now slathering butter on his phallus. I reach back to spread my buttocks apart. \"Me too,\" I remind him. He comes behind me and smears a generous dollop on my anus, then works it inside with his finger. I shiver with anticipation.\n\nHe pauses. I can tell exactly what he is thinking, the scamp: he is salivating at the sight of my buttery anus; he wants to lick it all out, slowly, and then start over again. I am tempted to go along with this. But my impatience for his phallus wins out.\n\n\"Uh-uh-uh,\" I chide. \"I want you inside me.\" He sighs.\n\nA moment later, his fingers dig into my buttocks, spreading them wide. I feel the hot head of his phallus against my exposed anus. Slowly it presses its way through my sphincter. I whimper at the strange pleasure of it, tinged with pain.\n\n\"Wait,\" I hiss. He obeys. I need a moment to adjust, to let my sphincter relax and ready myself for the pounding I am about to receive. I breathe slowly. I feel melting butter trickling down out of my anus into my pubic hair, mingling with the nectar flowing from my woman-flower. I wriggle back a little, taking him in a finger-breadth deeper. Then a little more. He gently presses forward. Slowly, slowly, the enormous butter-coated shaft slides deeper and deeper into my rectum, till at last he is completely buried in me. We stay like that for some time. The feeling of fullness is quite overwhelming. He licks my shoulders and neck. I coo with pleasure. My son's phallus feels so deliciously warm and alive, deep inside me. His hands begin to fondle and knead my heavy breasts, his fingers playing with my nipples, making them leak milk.\n\nAsterion cannot understand my speech, but somehow he can read my body with perfect understanding, knowing exactly when I am ready for him to start. He withdraws a little, then slides it back home. Then again, a little more forcefully this time. And again. Soon he is pounding into my rectum with all his might, his heavy testicles slapping against my buttocks and thighs, as I whimper and keen and wail and come again and again; my nectar repeatedly spraying out all over his thighs; my breasts leaking milk, soaking the bed; my legs trembling. His breathing becomes more and more excited. He is close, I know.\n\nMy thoughts all turn to mush, and I'm aware of nothing but the glorious battering ram pounding deep in my rectum. At last he tenses up and bellows, filling my bowels with his hot seed.\n\nHe withdraws, with a final caress and squeeze of my buttocks. My body is completely limp now, as though every bone in me had melted away. My legs are still shaking. Tenderly he lifts me back into bed, then rolls in beside me. I lie back, too exhausted to move. I feel a gush of his seed spilling out of my gaping anus, wetting the mattress beneath me, along with all my other fluids. The servants will have to clean that up later.\n\nPresently, Astarion pulls and lifts me so that I am mostly lying on top of him, my head resting on his chest. His hand strokes my hair. I look into his eyes and smile.\n\n\"Hmmagh-hmmagh.\"\n\n\"I love you too, son. Thank you.\"\n\n* * *\n\nWe rest in each others arms for some time, recovering. Eventually, we switch positions, with him resting his head on my breasts. He takes one of them in his mouth, licking my nipple with his tongue. (Asterion's frequent sucking at my breasts, whenever we lie together, has caused me to be in milk once again.) I sigh with relief and pleasure now as he nurses, emptying out both sides.  I cradle his head against me, tenderly caressing his brow and horns.\n\n\"We can continue this later, son. It is time for our bath. I think we both need it after that, darling.\"\n\nWe make our way, arm in arm, to the bathing chamber. He rubs oil on my body and scrapes it off with a strigil. As he kneels down, I pour water over him, then scrub his fur vigorously with a boar-bristle brush. I pour oil over his phallus and scrotum, and lovingly rub it in with my hand. We both plunge into the pool to rinse off. The cold water revives me. I can think again now. And it soothes my sore sphincter muscles.\n\nIt seems that all that pounding has given us quite an appetite. We put our clothes back on, and I summon the servants, who have been waiting by the cave entrance. They bring in our evening meal and serve it up: tonight it is grilled sea bream on a bed of spinach leaves, with plenty of fresh-baked flatbread, washed down with a crisp resiny white wine. I am a hearty eater, but Asterion, of course, eats four times more.\n\nOne of the servants changes our bed-linen, as the other one lights the lamps.\n\n\"Will there be anything else this evening, my Goddess?\"\n\n\"No, that is all. You may leave us.\"\n\nOf course the servants know perfectly well what goes on between my son and me. They probably could hear everything a short while ago: my cries and his bellowing, and the slapping together of our flesh. They can see the state of our bed. The caves smell strongly of our coupling. Of course rumours of this circulate among the broader population. But my people are already accustomed to pretending not to acknowledge the scandal of Asterion's existence. If I lie with my son, that is simply one more shocking little scandal for them to pretend to ignore.\n\nAsterion now takes me to his work chamber, showing me the model ship he made today. I took him to the harbour only once, when he was four years old; he has not seen a ship since that day. Yet he has created an accurate model - sail, oars, rigging and all. It is marvellous. I praise him for the model at great length. This will make an excellent gift for Kikeru, the harbour-master. Asterion does not understand my words, but he understands that I am pleased with his work, and he is content.\n\nBut my time with my son is precious. Only a few more hours before we sleep. I cannot carry on conversations with him; we communicate in a more primal way. The anal pounding earlier took a lot out of me, but I am ready for more now. I lead him back to the bed-chamber. I shed my bodice and skirts again, lying back in bed. My son, naked as well, climbs on top of me, between my open thighs. He licks and feeds at my breasts for some time, making me shiver with love and desire.\n\n\"Please son!\" I beg.\n\nOnce again, I feel that glorious tree-trunk of a phallus slide into my woman-sheath, filling me up so perfectly. His pace is slower this time, less frantic - but just as forceful: a long, steady pounding. I grip his powerful shoulders; I grab his horns and pull his face down to kiss me. After some time, I turn over onto my knees and elbows, so he can pound into me from behind. He keeps going for over an hour. I come and come and come again, I know not how many times. At last, he comes too, bellowing and spurting his seed deep within me.\n\nI am his mother; I am his cow in heat.\n\nAfterwards, I take him in my mouth, deep in my throat. I receive my after-meal treat, yet another measure of his precious seed, filling my stomach.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning as I dress, I try to clasp my girdle. It is too tight. I must loosen it. This is the second time I have loosened it. Suddenly I recall: my moon-blood did not come last month. I am well into the second month.\n\nWell well.\n\nIt is hardly surprising, with all the seed he has been pumping into my womb. No morning sickness this time: that is a blessing. A little sister or brother for Asterion. As the realization hits me, I begin floating in a cloud of joy.\n\nAs I give my son his morning breastfeeding, I try to convey to him the good news, with words and gestures, that I am with child - his child. But he does not understand. He only sees that I am suddenly very happy, not knowing why. Of course he has no memory of my previous pregnancy: he was inside me! He does not understand where children come from. Or does he? Well, he will find out soon enough. He will see the changes in my body. Two months gone, in seven more months he will be confronted with a little infant, bovine or human or some mixture of the two, perhaps without any inkling of what is coming. I shall hate not being able to explain this to him.\n\nWell, I shall have to keep him reassured that all is well, with me, and between us. That much I can do. When I take his phallus in my mouth, all care and sadness leave him. I lick my lips, looking forward to these reassurance sessions.\n\nIf it is a girl, I shall call her Ariadne. It means \"most holy\", a fitting name for our future Goddess. I hope it will be a girl.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"56417806\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"N/A\", \"Victim\": \"N/A\", \"Perpetrator\": \"N/A\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 56347633, "full_story": "Melinoe is the goddess of nightmares and madness. She can speak and control the ghosts that reside in the mortal world. She has spent centuries helping her father, but desires something different. Melinoe has been watching the past, present, and future of the Targaryens. She has also sent them nightmares to warn them. \n\nMelinoe looked up to where her father sat. \"Have you heard of the Targaryen's?\"\n\n\"The idiots who worship the weak gods. It's quite amusing when their souls pass through here instead of wherever they believe they do. As if their gods are as powerful as us,\" Hades sneered.\n\nThe goddess of nightmares nodded and feigned innocence and curiosity. \"Anything interesting happening there?\"\n\nHer father looked at her and sighed. \"Whatever you're thinking the answer is no.\"\n\n\"Come on! I'm so bored here. It's the same routine every day for thousands of years! It's getting tiring to torment people here,\" Melinoe complained.\n\n\"Why don't you visit Olympus?\" He said absentmindedly.\n\nMelinoe disappeared, black smoke surrounding her body and reappeared right in front of her father's throne. \"That got boring 200 years ago! and Uncle Zeus has banned me for turning him into a fish.\"\n\nThe room had went silent and Hades was staring at his daughter in stunned silence. Melinoe just smile innocently. Her uncle Zeus absolutely hated the sea. And he obviously didn't take being a fish in his brother's territory well. At all. Instead Melinoe was banned from the heavens, the seas, and Athens. Her cousin Athena didn't like how she tormented the mortals with ghosts. Or madness. But what else is she supposed to do if not torment beings that are below her?\n\nHades burst out laughing, startling Melinoe. She stared at him with a hint of disbelief. He was always brooding that seeing him smiling was both scary and relieving.\n\nWas it really so bad that she wanted something different? She just really wanted to see the dragons in person. And to see if there was more entertainment than here.\n\n\"So is that a yes? Please! If you don't agree I will make the Underworld my personal playground,\" she glared. They both knew she was being serious and Hades didn't really care. He loved his daughter but it would be nice for the Underworld to have some quiet. \n\n\"Go ahead daughter. But at the first sign of real trouble, you come right back.\"\n\nMelinoe held in her squeal and rushed to give her father a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Then she rushed to her room.\n\nShe really didn't need to pack anything, but she needs her onyx pendent so that the ghosts won't overload her. It was a birthday gift from her father. It was the one valuable object she has. When she had retrieved it she had stopped and looked down at herself. The thin dress she is wearing is half black and white, just like her hair. It was parted the same way as her hair which she always thought was pretty. Meaning she had white hair on the left and that part of the dress was also white. She also wore a light crown upon her head, showing her goddess status. Her eyes were pure white, a contrast to her abilities. Ironically, there was nothing light about her goddess powers. The white represented the afterlife. Represented the fact that there is life after death and where you go depends on the choices you make in your human life.  \n\nMelinoe was excited to finally see the dragons. There are of course dragons in the Underworld, but they're more... skeletal and dead looking. Which was pretty awesome, but she wanted to meet living ones. \n\nHer cousin, Apollo, had been letting her see the future for the Targaryen's and had let her know now is the time. Melinoe really wanted to wait until they were killing each other but her cousin had always advised against it. He's of course no fun, but at least he assisted her. \n\nMelinoe had disappeared to King's Landing, leaving behind only black smoke. She appeared to what looked like a funeral. She made sure she was invisible to the human eye and watched the proceedings. There seemed to already be a divide between the Greens and Blacks. Melinoe giggled when the man speaking had made a subtle insult to Rhaenyra's children. It seems these humans are as stuck up as Athena. Throughout the proceedings she couldn't help but notice the ghost that appeared pregnant and sad. \n\nThe ghost made eye contact with her and approached the Goddess. \"I'm ready.\"\n\nMelinoe smiled sadly and reached her hand out. \"May you and your child have peace in the Elysian Fields.\"\n\nThe beautiful woman appeared brighter and smiled as she closed her eyes. The Goddess watched as her soul vanished and knew her mother would have a soul to take to paradise. Woman who die in childbirth deserve to be taken to the Elysian Fields. \n\nThe Goddess saw and felt the tension between the factions. It was hilarious to her that Alicent was obssessed with Rhaenyra. The pious woman hid behind her false gods and claimed to be virtuous. How silly.  \n\nMelinoe followed Rhaenyra but quickly went to someone else as Daemon approached her. She remembered watching that scene and didn't want to be apart of it. She gasped in excitement as she saw the little green boy approach the large dragon. How was this little boy not afraid? \n\nThe boy, Aemond, approached cautiously the Goddess saw the dragon eyeing him up. It was like the dragon was measuring his soul to see if he was worthy. It seemed to be a positive assessment when Aemond climbed on her back and flew into the sky. \n\n\"I want to ride a dragon,\" Melinoe pouted. She wondered if there were any more dragons and went to look. She stopped in her tracks when she felt the presence of ghosts. There were so many that if it wasn't for her pendant, she would've collapsed. She let out a shaky breath and calmed herself. \n\nTurning around, she walked in the direction of the castle. Her pace quickened when she heard crying and yelling. Finally!\n\nShe teleported to the room, becoming impatient with walking. She was a goddess, she wasn't going to do a mundane task like running. She saw Aemond with a bloody eye and Rhaenyra's child with a bloody nose. Children seem to be quite vicious. \n\nRhaenyra and Daemon came in, appearing disheveled and Melinoe laughed. They really couldn't have picked a better time. \"Who did this?\"\n\n\"They attacked me!\" \"He attacked Baela!\" \"He broke Luke's nose!\" \"He stole my mother's dragon!\" Melinoe heard all at once. She really tried to keep it in but at the last child's comment, she burst into laughter. \n\nShe broke through her glamour and startled everyone in the room by her laughing. When the guards looked at her eyes, they began to advance forward.\n\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you, mortals.\"\n\nThey froze in their step and the false pious woman demanded to know who she was. Melinoe was bored of this woman already and all she did was demand an answer. I felt pity for those who had to listen to her. on a daily basis. \"I don't listen to mortals, but I am Melinoe, the Goddess of Nightmares and Madness.\"\n\nEveryone seemed to be frozen in shock, but I heard startled chuckles. You know, Melinoe didn't like being laughed at. It's quite an insult. Everyone watched as her eyes glowed a brighter white and how black smoke appeared out of her right hand. Their eyes followed the smoke and it revealed a familiar woman. A woman whose soul hadn't been taken yet. \n\nQueen Aemma.\n\nThe children cried and hid behind their parents while the others watched on in horror. Queen Aemma approached her daughter who had silent tears streaming down her face. \"My sweet daughter. I am so proud of you and I will always love you.\"\n\nIt seemed the Queen had finally found peace. Melinoe felt a heaviness in her arms and looked down to see a beautiful baby boy. She smile softly and called out to the dead Queen. \"Your soul is ready, Queen Aemma. And someone is waiting for you.\"\n\nThe ghost turned to the Goddess and approached with a bright smile. She took the baby in her arms and turned to King Viserys, who looked as if he was going to be sick. The dead Queen thought of saying something to him, but knew it would hurt more if she was silent. She turned to the Goddess and indicated she was ready to go.\n\nMelinoe once again reached her hand out, \"May you and your son roam the fields in Paradise. Don't worry, your other children are waiting.\"\n\nShe disappeared slowly and Melinoe raised an eyebrow to the occupants in the room. The ones who wore green appeared to be terrified, while Rhaenyra appeared to be content. Melinoe approached the Heir to the throne. \"Don't worry, my mother will make sure Queen Aemma and her children will always be happy.\"\n\nMelinoe clapped her hands, shocking everyone out of their stupor. \"Now where were we?\" she out a hand on her chin before jumping and turning to Daemon's daughters. \"Oh I remember. No one can steal a dragon, child. If the dragon didn't deem Aemond as worthy, she wouldn't burnt him to a crisp.\"\n\n\"It wasn't his to take,\" the girl snapped. Daemon saw how annoyed the goddess was and gripped his daughter's shoulder to silence her. What awful manners this child has. \n\nMelinoe chose to ignore the small mortal and approached Alicent. She could feel the eyes on her and she saw how the false Queen shook. Melinoe giggled as she caressed her face. \"You're going down a dark path, false Queen. And you will have no Gods to save you.\"\n\nThe woman let out a gasp and clutched the pendent on her chest. \"Stop your lies! The Seven will protect me!\"\n\n\"Are humans always this amusing? Didn't you hear what I said? The Seven don't exist.\" Before the Targaryen's can say anything, the Goddess raised a hand. \"The Valyrian gods exist, but they are weak compared to us. The magic of Valyria has almost run out.\"\n\nEveryone listened carefully to her words and had no choice but to believe her. She moved away from Alicent and walked towards the King. He was still looking at the spot where his dead wife was. Pathetic. \"And you. Viserys, the weak. When my brother and I sent those nightmares to you, you were meant to learn from them.\"\n\nThe King snapped his eyes to the Goddess and went to protest. But she had interrupted him. \"Didn't you feel the dread every time you woke up? They were nightmares, you idiot. A son would bring the destruction of your family.\"\n\nMelinoe rolled her eyes and walked towards the center of the room and made eye contact with every single person. Her smile unnerved everyone and the children seemed to be the only ones not afraid of her. Interesting. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a sword coming at her head. She lifted her hand and stopped the sword and the person who held it. She slowly turned and saw it was the guard dog. \n\n\"You're quite stupid aren't you? Prince Daemon. What did I say I was the goddess of?\"\n\nPrince Daemon smirked. \"The goddess of nightmares and madness, your divinity.\"\n\n\"That's correct. And as you've seen I can control ghosts.\" Melinoe scoffed at the audacity and stepped back. \"Honestly, you're not worth it to be killed by a Goddess. In fact, I think there's someone here who would very much like to slit your throat.\"\n\nDaemon walked forward, but stopped when the Goddess held up a hand. \"Not you.\" Her pure white eyes went to Rhaenyra. \"You. I'm sure you'd want the honors after how he treated your sons.\"\n\nThe Goddess had thought she would say no, but Rhaenyra stood firm when Daemon gave her his dagger. Before Rhaenyra could do anything, a loud \"No!\" was heard. Everyone turned to see Alicent with Viserys' dagger going towards Rhaenyra's son, Lucerys.\n\nRhaenyra and Daemon were too far to stop her and all Rhaenyra could do was scream. She had stopped when she the Goddess standing in front of her son. Alicent's eyes went wide before the dagger pierced through the Goddess' chest. There was a moment where Alicent smiled with glee but it dropped when she saw the fury in those white eyes.\n\nMelinoe chuckled darkly and gripped the false Queen by her neck. That seemed to catch the attention of the Green's and she could hear Alicent's father demanding to have the Goddess killed. \n\n\"You know I came to the human world to ride a dragon and have fun, but now I will destroy the Green faction. I've never seen mortals so idiotic before and I will surely have a talk with Athena about her useless creatures,\" she seethed. Black smoke appeared and held the Green's in place. \"I cannot be killed as I am a Goddess. But the intent is still there.\"\n\nMelinoe gripped Alicent's throat tighter, making her try and claw her way out. The goddess leaned forward and gazed into her eyes. \"I will make sure your soul never finds peace. You will never see your mother or your children again.\"\n\nAlicent's eyes widened. \"Please don't kill my children! They did nothing wrong! I was at fault, don't punish them for my sins.\"\n\nHer children were tense and Melinoe can feel fear coming from them. \"Unlike you, I don't kill children. What I can do is have their minds erased so they will never remember you.\"\n\nThat seemed to have broken her as she sobbed uncontrollable. Melinoe was annoyed by her cries and was quickly becoming bored. She squeezed her neck until she felt Alicent's life drain from her body. She let go of her and ran her hands over her dress, trying to ride herself of the mortal. Melinoe made eye contact with the ghost who was still crying. \"May your soul never find peace and let Hades deal with all of you.\"\n\nWith those words, her soul disappeared along with every other green in the room. Melinoe knew her father would get the message and he wouldn't be please. Ignoring the mortals who were  watching her cautiously, she approached Aemond, Aegon, and Helaena. These poor children. She caressed each of their faces and felt a wave of sadness when each one of them flinched before leaning into her touch. \n\n\"There's no need to be afraid anymore, little dragons,\" she said softly. \"Though I do have a gift for you. A gift of youth. It will erase your memories and give you a new start. Or you can have your memories erased and reside with Rhaenyra.\"\n\nAemond and Aegon looked horrified at the last option. Aegon looked at the Goddess skeptically, \"If we take the.. gift who will raise and take care of us?\"\n\nMelinoe clapped her hands together and giggled. \"Great question, little dragon. Before I tell you, everyone who is not a Targaryen needs to leave the room.\"\n\nThe room cleared so fast and it was amusing to see them trying not to trip over the bodies that covered the floor. When only Targaryen's remained, she spoke. \"Have you ever wondered why you can connect to dragons? It's because of the blood that runs through your veins. You are descended from the weak Gods and you have a very slim piece of divinity in you.\"\n\nShe turned towards Aegon to answer his question. \"Because of the divinity in your blood, you can be raised by a god/goddess of your choice.\"\n\nGasps were heard and Viserys chose now to grow a spine. \"You cannot just take my children.... your divinity.\"\n\n\"Father, shut up,\" Rhaenyra snapped. She was pale, but anyone can see she was relieved. \"Did you not see what happened to half of the people in this room? It seems you'd like to join mother as fast as you can.\"\n\nMelinoe snorted and covered her mouth. Heads turned to her and she cleared her throat, trying to stop the laugh that wanted to crawl it's way out of her throat. \"Oh, child. Your father will never enter the Elysian Fields.\"\n\nViserys looked as if he was going to be sick. He knew that meant he'd never see his wife again. \"I don't understand.\"\n\nThe goddess feigned sadness and sighed, \"Let me put it this way. In your quest for a male heir, which you ignored my warnings about, you killed 6 children and your wife. Because Queen Aemma had become with child so young and had no rest between pregnancies, her body wasn't strong enough. And whose fault is that? Yours.\"\n\nMelinoe enjoyed his gasps of pain as he realized the consequences to his actions. She couldn't help but dig the knife deeper. \"Queen Aemma is with her 6 children in Paradise. And you. Will. Never. See her. Again.\"\n\nHe broke down sobbing and collapsed to his knees. Don't worry, he didn't die. It's not his time, yet. Melinoe ignored him and turned back to Aemond, Helaena and Aegon. \"Do you have an answer, little dragons?\"\n\nShe expected them to be frightened of her. After all, she did kill their mother and grandfather. Oh, can't forget she killed their guard dog too. What a waste of space those mortals were. \n\nWhen she met their eyes, they were full of hope. Maybe a little bit of distrust. Helaena was the first to speak. \"I accept. And I think you know who I would choose, your divinity.\"\n\nMelinoe smiled softly at the little seer. \"My cousin, Apollo, would be honored to raise you as his daughter.\"\n\nThe seer smiled widely and hugged the goddess. Melinoe froze, but quickly returned the embrace. Maybe children aren't so bad to have. \n\nThe goddess looked to Aemond and Aegon who looked even more hopeful. They both agreed to the gift, but Aemond wanted the Goddess to choose for him. Melinoe thought about the temperament of the boy. Her beloved cousin, Ares, loved his children. He might've been bloodthirsty but there was nothing he wouldn't do for his kids. \n\n\"The god of war would be a great choice for you, Aemond. I see how fierce you will become and Ares will love and protect you,\" she mused. \n\nA scoff was heard and Melinoe turned to Daemon with an amused look on her face. \"Is there a problem, Prince Daemon?\"\n\nHe stiffened and the smirk dropped from his face. It seems he forgot who was in the room with him. His daughter's hid behind him, fearing the Goddess would harm their father for speaking out. \"The Hightower's don't deserve this honor, your divinity. They should join their kin.\"\n\nRhaenyra gasped and turned to her uncle with a look of horror. Before she could defend her siblings, the Goddess did it for her. \"They are children who were raised to believe you and Rhaenyra would kill them. And it seems like they had a right to be concerned as you just threatened them.\"\n\nShe stepped towards the man and enjoyed how he tensed. She was significantly shorter than him, but that didn't stop the fear Daemon felt. \"It's funny how you seem to forget they are still your blood. They even have dragons they are bonded to. Your hatred for them is unwelcome and childish.\"\n\nMelinoe dismissed him and turned to Aegon who looked at her in awe. \"Do you have anyone in mind, Aegon? Though with your love for the arts, Apollo would be a great choice.\"\n\nAegon immediately shook his head. He looked bashfully at the Goddess before mumbling something even she couldn't understand. Melinoe smiled encouragingly at him, \"Go ahead and say it.\"\n\n\"Can you do it? I mean can you raise me as your own?\" He blurted. The goddess looked at him in surprise and contemplated it. Normally she'd say no, but she has come to the conclusion that children aren't so bad. Besides, she can teach him how to torment her father. \n\nMelinoe smiled in delight, but frowned. \" I would love to, but I'm not perfect Aegon. I can be a bit of a nuisance sometimes and I don't think I would be a good mother.\"\n\n\"Will you hit me? Or insult me?\"\n\nThe goddess looked at him appalled, \"Of course not!\"\n\n\"Then I want you to be my mother,\" Aegon demanded. \n\nMelinoe clapped excitedly and brought the three in for a hug. \"I am excited! It's been soooo long since there have been small children around! I can't wait to terrorize the Pantheon!\" And with that exciting thought in mind, all 4 of them disappeared in a puff of black smoke. \n\n \n\n ", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"56347633\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"tearing to pieces\", \"Victim\": \"Hightower kin\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Melinoe\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"unknown Hightowers\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Melinoe\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 17464, "full_story": "You cannot sleep. You lie in your extravagant bed alone, you, Alexandros, the fairest man this side of the Aegean Sea. Helen has not touched you in years; she hates you for taking her away from Menelaus. You don't love her, either.\n\nHe presses heavily against you, tan fingers digging into your golden thighs, and you can almost see the purple bruises that will appear the next morning. You try to touch him, but he only bats your hands away before clutching your thighs again.\n\n\"I hate you,\" he tells you\n\nYou only ever loved him. You never loved Oenone or Helen...only him. You think you should have stuck with one of them, probably Oenone since she loved you, because neither of them are your brother, and that makes all the difference\n\nand you know he doesn't, you know he loves you. Everyone loves you, or loved, anyway, except for Cassandra, and he is no exception. He welcomed you when you first appeared at the palace in your shepherd drags, and even when you brought Helen back and earned yourself disapproval from some, he never did anything but love you and support you.\n\nThe only difference with him is that you love him back\n\nbecause only your brother can hurt you this much. Sometimes, you wish you never fell in love with Hector.\n\nHis widow is still in mourning, but you, who love him the most, received your entire share when the funeral games ended. You are the only person left to command the army, and you wish you fought more when Hector was still alive\n\nand you know he knows that as well. He continues.\n\n\"I hate you for foolishly bringing Helen to Ilium just because Aphrodite promised her to you. I hate you for charming me so much that I didn't force you to take Helen back to Sparta so that she won't bring war upon us. I hate you for turning to me when she abandoned you. I hate you for making me love you so that I can't hate you,\" he utters lowly, sliding into you faster and rougher, and you know now that he isn't lying, that he loves you but hates you at the same time.\n\n\"I can't believe I'll die because of you,\" he growls\n\ninstead of charming your way out of everything in order to live a life of idleness and luxury. But you still had Helen then, and by the time you lost her, no one came to ask you to fight anymore. They all still loved you, of course, because you are Paris, but Hector was the only one who really cared about you. At least, he was the only one who actually came to you when Helen left you.\n\nAnd now, you have no one. You don't have Oenone or Helen and especially not the only person you ever loved, and you think that maybe you deserve all this because it is your fault, anyway, that any of this happened. You caused everything, so you really shouldn't be surprised that you would lose in the process as well, even with Aphrodite's protection.\n\nand you arch up into him as he says, \"Because I killed Patroclus, Achilles won't let me live.\" With one last thrust, you are coming, and he says then, \"I won't live to see tomorrow night. All because you made me too weak to order the return of Helen,\" and when you finally regain enough senses to open your mouth in protest, he covers it brutally with his own.\n\nHe releases you with the taste of blood in your mouth, and he tells you, \"Never again, Paris. You can't charm me anymore.\" He turns away from you, and though you reach for him, he doesn't see. He doesn't want to see.\n\nHe doesn't turn back, just dresses himself and leaves you by yourself in your bed, and you think that maybe he doesn't know that you love him, after all, that you are in love with him.\n\nYou finally manage to sleep a few hours before a servant awakens you, and when you dismiss him, you gaze at the armor laid before you, the armor that you must wear now that your brother is gone. You touch each piece and wonder how your brother felt, sweating under them in the sun, blood staining the shining metal plates.\n\nYou put your armor on slowly, and when you finish, you gaze into the mirror and know that you don't fit within the confines of war. Your golden, smooth skin contrasts sharply with the cold hardness of the armor, and you are reminded of the scars and calluses on Hector that you used to lick as he slowly stripped himself of his armor. Hector was a warrior; you are nothing but a soft prince.\n\nYou watch when Achilles strikes your brother down, watch your brother's glorious form fall under the wrath of a goddess's son, and you can almost hear your brother telling you again that he hates you, that you are the reason he won't live to see the sun set this day.\n\nWhen Achilles drives around the city with your brother's corpse tied to the chariot, you turn away from the dust beginning to cover Hector's handsome figure. The spectators on the walls weep, and though you yourself do not, you think that they have no reason to cry at a hero's death when only you ever loved him the way he deserved to be loved.\n\nNo one stops you when you leave for your rooms, too caught up in their own grief and despair at the seemingly inevitable doom of Troy to even notice you slipping away. You don't cry; you don't know how to because you have never before had an occasion to do so.\n\nYou only hope Hector forgives you\n\nYou stand upon the city walls, and you can discern Achilles by the godly armor he wears. You think of your dead brother's beautiful body burned at the pyre, think of how you will never again see the sunlight glinting off of your brother's armor as he fights, and you want nothing but revenge for the death of the only person you ever loved. You know Phoebus Apollo favored Hector, and you pray he may help you, too.\n\nThe thick dust before Troy rises as the day's battle begins, and you whisper to the glint of gold shining through the hazy cloud at irregular intervals, \"Dust you are, and to dust you shall return.\"\n\nbecause though you caused his death, you will also avenge him. He is the only person you ever loved, and \n\nHe is the only person you will ever love.\n\n04.02.24", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"17464\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"killed\", \"Victim\": \"Patroclus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"struck down\", \"Victim\": \"Hector\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Achilles\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"death\", \"Victim\": \"Hector\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Achilles\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 17701, "full_story": "\nYear 1\n\n\n Spring\n\n You find the court of Lycomdes boring, cooped up with the women. They do nothing but weave all day, and they always berate you gently when you make some blunder that the princess Pyrrha should have stopped making in childhood. You can see the looks of confusion and pity in their eyes, and even though you want to, you cannot tell them that you are meant for something much greater than this. The monotonous, confined routine is more than enough to drive you insane. \n\n You long to see Patroclus again. You do not know whether he is still with Chiron or if he is back in Pthia, and you do not really care. You would even stay here if he were here with you. You wouldn't mind going back to Chiron, either, where you ran wild, or your own home in Pthia, where you at least had some freedom, much more freedom than as Pyrrha. \n\n When Deidamia comes to you, you do not refuse her. You are lonely and bored, and you don't see why you should say no. She is not particularly beautiful, but neither is she plain. When you fuck her, you imagine she's Patroclus, and that makes you hard every time, but you cannot maintain the illusion when she talks to you. \n\n It is not enough. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n The soldiers are restless, waiting for Iphigeneia to arrive. Some of the other kings can barely control their troops now, and riots have become commonplace. Fights, too, because there is no other way to let out all the pent-up frustration and aggression, not since the surrounding towns have been sacked. \n\n Your troops know better, of course. You may be the youngest among the kings, but you know you are stronger than all of them. All the men know it, too, and they often skirt a berth around you when you're walking through camp, careful not to offend you even accidentally. \n\n That just makes it easier for you to laze in your tent with Patroclus. He is still as handsome as ever, sun-blessed hair and skin and sport-honed warrior's body, and it's yours, all yours. \n\n You want to fight and win glory for yourself, but you want Patroclus more, especially when he lies before you, golden and bare and that look in his eyes, that smile-smirk on his mouth. \n\n You won't mind if Iphigeneia doesn't come for another month. \n\n \n\n Autumn\n\n The Trojans have been expecting your fleet. They are ready for your attack, and it goes badly at first when Achaeans are being slaughtered even before they set foot on land. But they clearly did not expect such a big force because they run out of arrows before all the ships have arrived, and with you and your men at the front, they are forced back into their city. \n\n Patroclus turns to you, blood on his cheek, and you want him very badly that instant. In your tent, you lick the blood from his cheek, and the gesture is both intimate and lustful. You think of licking blood off his body after a long day's battle, and you become unbelievably hard. \n\n Only he can do this to you. \n\n \n\n Winter\n\n The Trojan winter is like winter back home, and the fighting continues underneath a less harsh sun. It snows one night, but you know that the war will go on the next morning, like nothing it has happened. \n\n The dirty sandals of everyone leave black imprints upon bright white, and as you go through the day, the snow is dyed splashes of crimson as well. It is an interesting sight, and at the end of the day, you think of the few times it has snowed while you were with Chiron. It was impossible to teach you and Patroclus those days, and Chiron could only let the two of you run wild. \n\n You have heard of lands in the north where it snows all winter long, and you think you would like to see that for yourself some day. You would like to watch the snow fall upon an already endless white, and you want to fuck Patroclus then, too, white on gold on gold on white. \n\n You will not have Patroclus upon soiled snow. \n\n \n\n Year 2\n\n Spring\n\n You can already tell that this will be a long war. The Achaeans have made little progress against Troy, and the army is never at full power because there always has to be some men spared for provision hunting. The Trojans can just stay in their city and merely repel your side's attacks, but that is not the point. You want to conquer Troy, and they want to drive you out. \n\n It is fine with you. The longer the war lasts, the more chances you have for everlasting glory before you die, as your mother told you you will. And the longer you can be with Patroclus. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n The Trojan summer is dry and hot, and it is only tempered by the sea breeze. You sweat just by standing under the sun, and if you were a lesser man, you would have lost control of your weapons from the sweat coating every bit of your skin and perhaps even lost your mind from the unbearable heat you must endure in full armor. \n\n But you are Achilles, and this is your specialty. And when the fighting is over, you have Patroclus, who removes your armor. His hands are not cool, but that does not matter. Having those hands upon your skin afterwards is worth fighting underneath the merciless sun every day. \n\n \n\n Autumn\n\n There are fires everywhere. Soldiers are running around you, looting and killing and raping at will, and panicked citizens are trying to avoid them and run to safety, if that even exists. You revel in this chaos, this destruction, this plunder. Patroclus is beside you, mouth drawn into a thin line, and you know he does not approve of the men killing and raping innocents, but he knows the realities of war, and he knows this cannot be prevented. \n\n You pin him against a wooden post, and you kiss him hard. He does not resist, and he does not protest when you reach beneath his skirt, either. It is fast and rough, and both of you are watching for danger during it, but you think it is beautiful the way the two of you can join so perfectly while a city is being destroyed around you. \n\n \n\n Winter\n\n The Trojan women gather on the walltop everyday and watch the fighting. At night, you hear soldiers talk about how they wouldn't mind fucking some of them, leers on their faces. Patroclus has remarked to you that even Andromache watches, but you know Helen does not, and you are not surprised. \n\n You find their wails annoying at worst and oddly amusing at best, and you want to fuck Patroclus in front of them, on the battlefield, in the midst of this death and blood and merciless destruction. You want to do it anyway, want to defy the very nature of war. \n\n If you ask Patroclus, you know he will not say no. \n\n \n\n Year 3\n\n Spring\n\n The blood of the dead seeps everywhere, and you notice that it has even spattered onto the newly green plants. Some days, it seems to drown them, and you know that plants cannot live on blood. You wonder if they can learn to, though, the same way many of the men have stopped reacting to the blood and gore and death. \n\n You are a good botanist, but you are a better warrior. It does not matter what the plants do because the bloodshed will continue, and no one except you and Patroclus, really, will notice if they die. But then, no one else has spent three days straight searching for a plant to cure each other, not knowing it was a test. The two of you would have done it anyway, even if you had known. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n Many gulls fly around now, mostly after the day's fight is over, pecking at the carcasses. The battlefield becomes complete gray and white, and the soldiers curse about having to shoo the gulls away. They swoop around camp, following the scent of blood and shrieking; there's always a few flying around you, and you find them annoying. \n\n Patroclus laughs at you, and he whispers into your ear, the blood on you is mine. The way he says it sends shivers through you, and you don't want it any other way. The next day, you snap off the neck of a particularly annoying gull, and when you enter your lodge, hands bloody, Patroclus merely raises an eyebrow at you, then raises your hands to his face and licks them clean, looking at you the whole time. It is so erotic, what he does, and you know no one else can make you feel this way. \n\n \n\n Autumn\n\n Some of the soldiers have taken up agriculture, and they have sectioned off a bit of land at the edge of camp, which they tend after the day's battle. Some of the others laugh at them, but you do not think it completely stupid, although you would not do something like that yourself. But then, you were not born a farmer. \n\n You would rather sack cities, but the goal is still the same: to get provisions. Their way is steady and sure, but you prefer danger and the thrill of conquering. You prefer watching a city burn before your eyes while you and Patroclus fuck, two contrasting kinds of beauty linked together for a moment, one wilting and one blooming, both breathtaking in the very way they are. But you know you and Patroclus burn brighter than the city. \n\n \n\n Winter\n\n You move through every day like you were born for it. You probably were, being a goddess's son. Fighting is in your blood, and it is always a rush killing your opponents, a simple stab of your spear or maybe a deep slash of your dagger. You are naturally elegant at it, and you feel as if all of this is part of your very being. Maybe it is. \n\n You do not care about the identities of those you kill. You only care about the way it feels as you move along the battlefield, an endless thrill and high and breathlessness as you dodge and stab and slash and block and kill. It arouses you, and you know that you have Patroclus at the end of the day. You are bonded to him through the blood the two of you share, but even if you weren't, you would have chosen him anyway because you know he would still feel like he's part of you. \n\n \n\n Year 4\n\n Spring\n\n You play the lyre, sometimes, at night. You know you are good at it, and it is relaxing, letting the simple and clear sounds wash over you, letting your fingers move themselves in a long memorized pattern. \n\n You can still remember learning how to play from Chiron, and although the music did not feel as natural as fighting did, it still came to you easily. When you could play well, you played to Patroclus first, under the moon, and you told him it would always be for him. \n\n It still is. When you play now, he always listens, draped across furs and hides, hooded eyes looking at you, and you know that when you finish, he will be hard and waiting for you, and the sex after is always some of the sweetest you have with him. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n Patroclus is handsome in everything he does. You have watched him take off his armor outside, watched a bright and a fading sun caress his golden skin, watched his muscles stretch as he moves his arms, watched him in battle as he killed the Trojans charging at him, watched blood splatter on that beautiful skin, and you know you are the only one who has all of this. You would not have it any other way. \n\n His body has not been foreign to you for a long time, but you still like to explore it as if it's the first time, back when those lines and edges and scars were still new to you. No matter how well you know him, everything about Patroclus is always like new to you, like you are discovering it again for the first time. That's just the way it is. \n\n \n\n Autumn\n\n Patroclus grows a goatee these days, when he does not have time to shave. You tease him about it, but it reminds you that he is no longer a child at all and you are a man in all ways except that one. You do not dislike it, though, not even when it scratches you. It is a delicious sort of pain, and you always wave his sheepish apology away. The goatee is just different, nothing more, nothing less. \n\n The two of you are no longer boys now, but nothing else has changed. Both of you are taller, leaner, and older, with more scars and experience and knowledge, but when he and you are alone, your bodies still fit together in the same way, and you know that will never change, nor will the way the two of you feel toward each other. \n\n \n\n Winter\n\n You know one of the main reasons, possibly the biggest, even, that your side still has not breached Troy's walls is due to the dispersion of the army. There are always soldiers away, sacking cities for more supplies, and you know Hector knows it, too, and wants to use it to his advantage. \n\n But there's always you and Odysseus and Ajax and Diomedes and many other great warriors, and none of you need those men who are away to prevent a Trojan victory. You know everyone has his own motivation. Yours is right beside you, and you will never let anyone else have Patroclus. \n\n \n\n Year 5\n\n Spring\n\n Both sides have lost many men. Less women gather on the walltops, and less men come out to fight all of you. But as long as there are still men left, the war will continue, unless Helen is returned. None of the kings except maybe soft-hearted old Priam care about the deaths. The issue has always been one of pride. \n\n You don't care, either. It is not your job to clean up the dead, and most of your men are still alive, and that is good enough for you. As long as Patroclus does not die, and you know he will not, the fate of others does not really concern you. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n The nights this summer are particularly humid, and you can hear the buzzing of the mosquitoes through the walls. They descend after the sun sets, and everywhere, you hear the sharp smack of skin against skin. \n\n They prey on you, too, faster than you can kill them, and when you stare at the red on your skin, you think, no one but Patroclus can have that. But you and Patroclus are both botanists, so the two of you leave camp one night to find the plants that ward off mosquitoes. The camp is in a disarray when the two of you return two nights later. The other kings send Odysseus to chide you; you just hand him a few of the plants you took back with you. No one says anything after that, but they do not know that the two of you took an extra day, and you would not give up that delicious day of sex for anything. \n\n \n\n Autumn \n\nPatroclus gets wounded on the arm, something much more serious than one of those usual shallow scratches, and you are furious. How dare someone mar that beautiful, golden skin? Only you are allowed to do anything like that to him. \n\n He says he can bandage himself, but you insist on doing it. It's not that he's not knowledgeable about medicine because both of you are, but you know he will just do a quick bandaging job and say everything is fine, and you do not want that. \n\n You play the lyre for him that night, and you make him promise not to fight until his arm is completely healed. The next day, you are fiercer than ever. You will not have that man live. You will not let anyone who hurts Patroclus live. \n\n \n\n Winter\n\n The Trojan winters have always been rainy, but it is a terrible rain that refuses to stop this year. Even Helios has not appeared much, and no one is fighting. The kings grumble about the damn delay and how they're sitting here for nothing while the supplies keep dwindling, and you yearn for the curve of a spear in your hand, the blade of a sheathed dagger bumping against your thigh, the solid impact of a weapon against your shield. \n\n Despite that, you cannot truly mind, not when you are dry in your lodge with Patroclus. While the rain pounds against the roof, the two of you fuck, languidly and gently and lingeringly, and it's like a million first times all over again. \n\n \n\n Year 6\n\n Spring\n\n The soldiers have grown restless, and you hear whispers of desertion at night, when they think no one is listening. You cannot really blame them. It's almost been six years, and Troy still stands safe and whole. The general morale has been fairly low for a while. \n\n You know, though, that none of the other kings will let them go. You will not, either. This is a war, and you know your side will win. Your Myrmidons will do whatever you tell them, and you know the other kings will convince their men to stay somehow. \n\n Even if they all leave, you will still stay. You don't need them to earn your glory. As long as you have Patroclus beside you, you know the two of you can conquer Troy by yourselves. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n It's a custom in summer for the men to disarm by the sea and jump straight in at the end of the day, and you are no different. The cool water washes all the sweat and blood and dirt and grime you've accumulated during the day away along with the bloodlust that takes over you and the high it gives you. \n\n Patroclus always joins you. His movements are simple and efficient, but you always feel like he's stripping for you. His body is always beautiful in the fading sunlight, faint gold on dark bronze-gold, and you can never resist running your hands over his skin in the water. But you don't do anything more, not among this crowd of strange men. \n\n One day, though, you want to fuck him here, fuck him until all you can feel is him and the sea water around you. \n\n \n\n Autumn\n\n Your men surprise you on your birthday with a celebration of sorts. They've built a roaring fire in front of your lodge, and there is singing and dancing and many slave girls. The Myrmidons tease you about finally being a man in every sense of the word since you've finally grown a full goatee that year when you don't shave, and you laugh with them, drunk and happy and glowing in the heat of the fire, Patroclus at your side. \n\n The sex that night is honey sweet, a generous tangle of limbs and hearts, and Patroclus says I love you against your ear when he comes, but you know. You've always known. It's still a good birthday gift. \n\n \n\n Winter\n\n It is not the first time Menelaus has been asked what he will do with Helen when they win the war, and it will not be the last, either. His answer always varies, but the most often one is that he does not know, that he will do whatever's appropriate at that time. \n\n You know that most of the other kings have their own ideas about what they would do to her. You are no exception. You waver between raping her, killing her, doing both, and giving her to Patroclus, but the first three options always sound the best. You have no sympathy for her, even though Aphrodite bewitched her, but if Patroclus asks for her, and he may because he already has once, you would give her to him. You would do so against your better judgment because it's what he wants. \n\n \n\n Year 7\n\n Spring\n\n The night is quieter than usual. For once, you can play the lyre outside and hear its clear notes, too, so you step out of your lodge, and Patroclus follows you. You sit on the bench outside and play, your eyes closed and fingers moving over the strings automatically, and you feel Patroclus lean against you, head on your shoulder, finger playing with the curls in your hair. It is intimate, like it's just the two of you and no one else, and you think you have never been like this with him before, have never had a chance to be like this with him before. And you know that this is what you want to be able to give him, this small semblance of normalcy, but because of who you are, this is exactly the one thing you will never be able to give him. \n\n You can only give him everything else, but you know he understands. He says it every time he touches you, feather light and lovingly careful, like you are someone precious, but you know that you are the one who's truly lucky, to have someone like him. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n You can see the longing in Odysseus's eyes, the very desire in the tense lines of his body. It's been almost seven years, and you cannot blame him for missing his wife. You see the same signs in many of the men as well, and you know they miss their families, too. \n\n You do not want to think about what you would be like if Patroclus were not here with you. You experienced that once already, and you do not want to again. Whatever Penelope is to Odysseus, Patroclus is to you at least a hundredfold, and you don't want to know what you would be without Patroclus to anchor you, how very different you would be now if Patroclus had not been there with you since almost the beginning. \n\n \n\n Autumn\n\n He offers you whatever you want for your birthday. His tone is light when he says that he has nothing left to give you that is not already yours, but his eyes are serious. And you think, I don't want anything else when I have you.\n\n You let him take you that night, and when he says, but it's your birthday, you tell him, taking is a form of giving, too, and you know he understands. Everything you have is his and everything he has is yours, but in the end, he is still giving to you tonight. He is giving you everything you want. \n\n \n\n Winter\n\n The funeral fires burn bright every night, little dots of light in a vast darkness, and you think this is the way war is. There is only death and more death, and that does not change, even at the end. War does not create life because Ares does not know how. \n\n There are many mounds at the edge of camp now, and although you are sure you will die before the war ends, you do not think you will be buried there. You don't mind death as long as you will have Patroclus until then, as long as he will preside over your funeral and take your urn back to Pthia, as long as your ashes can mingle with his the way your bodies join now. \n\n \n\n Year 8\n\n Spring\n\n It is Patroclus's birthday, and you have nothing to give him, either, except for yourself. And some treasures you've looted off of today's dead opponents, but it's nothing special, and you already have plenty of it from the past seven years. \n\n But you deck yourself in jewels and wear your armor, and it is exquisite watching him undress you, one article at a time, without any hurry, hands resting on every bit of newly bared skin, his very touch driving you wild. You know it is the same for him. It is a slow burn and breakdown that night as he fucks you, and you know this is what he wants it to always be like. You want it, too. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n The talks of desertion have grown more frequent; you are not surprised when Agamemnon summons everyone and reminds them of the oath. You are one of the few kings not bound by it, but Patroclus is, and you would not leave him. Everyone knows this. It is the one bit of power Agamemnon has over you. \n\n Patroclus says thank you as he leaves for battle, and he does not look at you. But it did not need to be said, and both of you know that. You play the lyre for him that night, and when he fucks you, you bite into his shoulder and say you are so stupid, I know, it'll always be this way. For him, you will make it. \n\n \n\n Autumn\n\n The Trojans receive reinforcements again. You think with the way this is going, both sides continuously receiving more troops every once in a while, the war will drag on for another eight years at the very least. But it is okay for you. They are just more men for you to kill and loot, just more people who may give you glory. \n\n When you kill a young boy who looks the way Patroclus did years ago, you think, but you are not Patroclus, and you do not have an Achilles who would do anything to keep you alive. You have Patroclus wear the two wristlets you took from him that night when he fucks you, and you think, this is the sort of love that appears only once or twice in all history.\n\n \n\n Winter\n\n Your prize is a woman whose name is foreign to your tongue and thus, forgotten easily, but she is quite good-looking, long brown hair and long black eyelashes and smooth bronze skin, and you think she will work. \n\n You give her to Patroclus, and you watch when he fucks her. They make a beautifully erotic sight, bronze on gold on bronze, her legs wrapped around his waist as he thrusts into her, and you can only stroke yourself, watching the muscles in his back shift underneath his firelight-touched skin, watching him kiss her roughly and leave blood on her lips. You think this is how the two of you must look when he fucks you, but you know the two of you are much more beautiful than this, gold on gold and so full of want and need and love in the movements of your bodies. It's because the two of you fit perfectly together, like you were never meant to be apart. \n\n \n\n Year 9\n\n Spring\n\n Despite the reinforcements that still arrive at intervals, the battles are no longer so loud and chaotic. The amount of people fighting is much less than what it was when the war began, and the war has all but become just another daily routine, a methodical task ingrained into everyone's lives. \n\n Because of this, Agamemnon tells everyone that the war is almost over, and you know that everyone desperately wants to believe it. But you know the war will not end as soon as Agamemnon says. You still haven't acquired everlasting glory. \n\n It works, though, because the soldiers are less discontent at night, and sometimes, even you pretend that soon, you will go home with Patroclus. It is an exhilarating feeling, and you know that this is the only thing you will ever regret. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n You can tell the days are long for everyone, and they wear on everyone's minds. Many have become sluggish because of this, weary from the constant fighting that has gone on for almost eight years, and those men are easily slain. \n\n It is the same to you because fighting is part of your blood, and you know that others have successfully fought it, Odysseus and Ajax and Agamemnon and Menelaus and Diomedes and, of course, Patroclus. It is a rush on the battlefield, slaying and sparring and watching them fight beside you, especially Patroclus, and at night, when you and Patroclus stick together because of the humidity, you think that if fighting wasn't in your blood, this would be worth it. \n\n \n\n Autumn\n\n Everyone can tell that the end is near. It is a general feeling in the air, and because of it, everyone fights harder, trying to sooner reach the day when they can once again live peacefully with their families. \n\n Patroclus asks you, one night, what you want to do after the war. Both of you know that you are fated to die before the war ends, but for one moment, the two of you pretend you do not know. You think you can sell all the plunder you've gotten if you want, and you'll probably end up ruling Pthia after your father dies, but you don't really care what happens as long as you are with him, and you tell him that. \n\n Patroclus smiles a little, and it's tinged with sadness, and he says, that's what I want, too.\n\n \n\n Winter\n\n Andromache has not been on the walltop lately, and at night, the men sneer at how Hector has time to knock his wife up despite the war in front of his door. You have noticed a change in Hector as well, although it is not very obvious. He is both more and less fierce at the same time: he is more efficient and methodical at killing his enemies, but his attention is also less concentrated on the task at hand, like something big's happening elsewhere. \n\n It reminds you of your own son, whom you have never seen and do not know or really care very much to know, either, born to you of a woman whom you bedded because you had nothing better to do. You know Patroclus would scold you for thinking this, would make you go see your son, but then, he does not know the way you have only wanted him for most of you life, the way you have only seen him for not much shorter. And that's okay, because your love for each other has already taken over both of you. \n\n \n\n Year 10\n\n Spring\n\n The men give you Briseis as your prize. She is pretty, and you can tell that she has never had to labor before, but you know she will serve you easily enough. You taunt her about what you'll do to her as you walk back to your lodge, grip tight around her arm, and you find amusement in the redness in her cheeks and the furious way she stares at you. \n\n Patroclus is waiting for you. You release her and tell her to clean herself, and she leaves after glaring at you. Patroclus laughs when she is gone and asks you what you've done to her, and you laugh, too, tell him that you've just overexaggerated what you wanted from her. He shakes his head, a smile on his lips, and then, you're kissing him, and when you pull back, you say, it's always been you, and he says I know into your lips. \n\n Briseis is staring at the two of you when you stop. You just kiss Patroclus again. \n\n \n\n Summer\n\n Patroclus is unhappy with you. You do not like it, but you cannot do this for him. You would do anything else, but not this. You will not leave, though you want to, a little, because you still want your glory. And because he cannot leave, and you will not leave him. But that is not enough for him. \n\n You fuck Briseis more often these days, but you still go to Patroclus every night. He ignores you sometimes, and that is when you leave and seek Briseis. But despite all of this, he usually doesn't, and although his mouth is angry and his hands are hard and it's mostly give, you welcome it. It has been ten years since the war started, and both of you are much older, but he is still so golden and handsome above you, and you think you can take it as long as he still wants you. Because he wouldn't fuck you if he didn't still love you. \n\n \n\n Autumn\n\n He chides you for not burying his body, but you cannot help it. You cannot bear to let him go, to watch the flames engulf and consume him, to never touch that lovely face and beautiful skin again. But you still cannot refuse him, so you tell him yes. \n\n Even as a ghost, you want him and love him, and you ask him to come closer so you can hold him one moment more. But he disappears before you can reach him, and you are left alone again. You have gotten your everlasting glory at a terrible price, and you do not care about dying here any longer. You will not let it claim you easily, but you will not fight it, either, not when Patroclus is waiting for you on the other side. \n\n \n\n Winter\n\n The Amazon Queen is a good opponent, but you defeat her in the end the same way you have defeated everyone else. Even in death, she looks beautiful, and it reminds you of Patroclus lying before you, hint of blood still on his golden skin reminding you of how he must have died. You can still imagine it clearly: a few spears thrust into that beautiful body, precious blood staining his skin, and the dust and sand starting to stick as everyone fought over him. \n\n You fuck her when she is dead. It is what you wanted to do to Patroclus when he lay stiff and unseeing before you, blood and dust carefully washed from his beautiful body, and you could have pretended that he was merely sleeping if you ignored the wound in his side. But you did not do that to him. You wanted to, but you did not. You would not have, would never have, because Patroclus is everything. \n\n 05.12.21", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"17701\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"spears\", \"Victim\": \"Patroclus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"enemies\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"defeat\", \"Victim\": \"Amazon Queen\", \"Perpetrator\": \"protagonist\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 41491, "full_story": "What can you say about a twenty-one year old girl who died?\n\nThat she wasn't twenty-one, for starters. She was thirty-two when she died and looked every day of it. History has proved that to be a bad age for great and careless people (Gilles Villeneuve and Swami Vivekananda, for example. Karen Carpenter.) Astrologically, Pluto comes around to visit you when you're thirty-two, after the exuberant carelessness of Zeus and Hermes have showered you in their bright, unseeing light. When Pluto comes, the blindness recedes from your eyes as his cool, leaden shadow falls over you, and he will make you answer for every excess of your youth. Everyone knows that this was the revenge of the stars on Alexander the Great, who died of a mysterious fever at the age of thirty-two, but at this time the Aegeans were not yet a superstitious lot, because their lives were not yet governed by the cold and impersonal light of distant planets, just very powerful gods, against whose randomness no salt over your shoulder and no straw men could guard you.\n\nBut he was twenty-one, still the darling of benevolent divinities. He remained so until the end. Perhaps they knew that they had already taken everything he could give. It is not often that human beings have a choice as stark as that which was offered to Achilles, son of Peleus, which is one way of looking at it. He had been at war for about five years by then - five years in Troy proper, that is, because the other way of looking at it was that Achilles had always been at this war, that he learned to walk and run and fight and be, because he was always, always, always meant to be this soldier on this plain, his glory as inevitable as death, as inevitable as the sky in his rainy-grey eyes.\n\nHe walked into a bar. They all did that on their furloughs. He was still a general; the Myrmidons were going to raze this town to the ground later sometime, but he had time for a drink before it happened. There were townsfolks lingering on the shore, holding hands, singing, looking dreamily at the horizon. There was nothing to disturb the view, no ominous looming figures of black ships. This little Pleasantville would be a minor operation, mainly scheduled for keeping his soldiers' hand in as and when strategy ordered them off the plain.\n\nNo one seemed to know who he was. He sat at the bar and asked for wine. Over in the corner an old woman was telling a gathering the story of Tantalus and how he cut up and served his own son Pelops as food for the gods. He watched the storyteller wave her hands, painting pictures of the horror, only half-listening. He knew this story of course; he had seen it enacted before his very eyes when they set out to sail. Agamemnon had murdered his own daughter to ensure good winds for the journey. Iphigeneia had been young, intelligent and gorgeous, very enthusiastic about being married to Achilles himself. That hadn't worked out. She had fought frantically before they killed her. The funny thing was, Pelops had been her great-grandfather, Agamemnon and Menelaus' grandfather. It had never occurred to her that the gods might resurrect her the way they did Pelops. It had never occurred to her at all that history was repeating itself.\n\n\"Nothing much's changed, has it?\" a voice sounded in his ear. He turned and there she was, dressed in combat fatigues and leather. She was tall, bronzed, with the sort of body that took years of fencing and running and good hard knocks to build up. She had long, olive-black hair and eyes darker than any child of Priam's. Achilles thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.\n\n\"Still bloodthirsty buggers, the lot of them.\" She sat down next to him and signalled for wine, too. \"It's the curse, isn't it. You can't end it. Their fathers and forefathers will all haunt them until they have their own mouthfuls.\"\n\nAchilles remembered the omen after her sacrifice. \"Like a snake,\" he said. \"Swallowing - \"\n\n\"Its own eggs. Exactly,\" she finished, picking up the cup before her and draining it in a gulp. \"Who's the redhead, then?\"\n\nHe stared at her, wondering what had happened to him. \"Hi, I'm talking to you, Sparky,\" she waved five long, callused fingers before his face and laughed.\n\n\"Pyrrhus,\" he said, not taking his eyes off her face. \"I'm Pyrrhus. And you're lovely.\"\n\n\"Whatever gave you that idea?\" She looked pleased, tilting her head and looking him over appreciatively. \"Try Penny.\"\n\n\"Penny,\" he breathed. \"Penelope?\"\n\n\"Ugh, no,\" she laughed again. \"Penelope is a horrible name. So is Penny, but my only other option is Silly. Very silly. I discourage people from addressing me by name as a rule.\"\n\nAchilles made an effort to smile, even though his heart seemed in danger of beating its way right out of his mouth at any moment. \"Not even your lovers?\"\n\n\"Especially not my lovers,\" she said, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"So what should I call you, then?\" It was out before he knew it, as inevitable, really, as everything else about him. Her eyebrow shot up a little higher, an eagle's wing upon her brow, and she said, \"'Your majesty' will do.\"\n\n \n\n--\n\nThree years later\n\nThey knew they were fighting each other even before the masks of war came off. It was in the movements, the curve of an arm as it swept around the other's body, the sweat-damp curls that escaped from a helmet, the surprise and the ferocity in the cries of passion. Things that no lover ever forgot about Achilles or Penthesilea. Time had drawn them close once more, almost as close as they had been that night in the town that was not so much as a memory even in the minds of its destroyers.\n\nHe found an opening and wounded her arm slightly before she pulled back and swung hard at his head. She was strong. She could crush and wound you and make you utterly forget who you were. She did not give you time or space. She would mean everything to you, consume you and give nothing back. He could not crumble to dust for her, though. He might have; it might have been easy and possible, but there were reasons that he did not, too many reasons, all of which came down to the single fact that he was not meant for her. Three years ago they had been drinking wine together and talking about the sons of Atreus. She had told him that they were cursed, and he had agreed, and wondered how the curse could be broken.\n\nShe had shrugged as if she did not care, and said, \"By someone brave enough to reverse destiny. To swallow the snake. To kill the father - or kill themselves.\"\n\nHe looked her in the eye and advanced towards her. He remembered the wisdom in them. She beat him back, attacking him with new reserves of energy that welled up in her just as she seemedd about to give up. It would not be too difficult to be beaten by this woman. You could give yourself up with honour; she would destroy you so completely that nothing, not even shame, could be left. She could entwine and break the threads of fate, invert destiny and kill the killer.\n\nHe thought, and thought that a curse was not a bargain with the gods. The House of Atreus could reverse their fortunes, but he could never break his.\n\nHe did not hate her for being unable to change what always had been. He did not even hate for dying when she finally did, sword knocked out of her hand, his blade sliced clean through her heart. She had her destiny too, and he was it. She had not made a bargain, she had not been cursed. She was beautiful and brave and he had loved her for it, but he never thought that she might have deserved more.\n\nShe was lying sprawled, still on the ground. Someone pulled her helmet off gently - she had fought well - and the hair, still long and black, fanned out on the earth around her. Her eyes were open, the wisdom gone, the fear gone. He knelt beside her to close them and noticed the eagle-wing brows, furled now, bleached by daylight battles.\n\n\"I hope you're clean, gorgeous,\" she had said on the stairs, leaning against the banister to look down at him. The eyebrows kept flying upwards, as though he were a perpetual incredulity. And he was.\n\nSomeone murmured his name. A crowd had gathered around them. Her blood pooled about them, lapping at his knees.\n\nI'm not, he thought, kissing the forehead, smooth and fading without life. I carry my death with me, and now you have yours.\n\nWhat can you say about a twenty-one year old boy who died? Pluto never had the chance to summon him. He was actually twenty-eight when it happened, the arrow flying into his heel almost an accident, if anything the stars have orchestrated for eternities can be an accident. What can you say about Achilles dying? Perhaps this: that he did not deserve more. That no one, not even a woman, not even a queen of the Amazons, ever got less.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"41491\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"sacrifice\", \"Victim\": \"Iphigenia\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Agamemnon\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"sword\", \"Victim\": \"Penthesilea\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Achilles\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"sword\", \"Victim\": \"Penthesilea\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Achilles\"}, \"death_event_4\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"sword\", \"Victim\": \"Penthesilea\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Achilles\"}} ```"}

She couldn't let her son die.\n\n\"I can't accept that,\" the young mother said. \"She ejected the diskette, write-protected it, and stuffed it in her coat pocket. She took her son out of the chamber and wrapped him in a warm blanket.\n\nThey beat a hasty retreat.\n\n---\n\nThe child in question was Meleager Calydon, the genetically-engineered son of Althea Calydon, and her husband OEneus Calydon, president of Calydon Enterprises, which you might remember took out Quest Enterprises in 2035.\n\nNow OEneus Calydon was quite a shady character. Besides his legitimate businesses like computers, sporting equipment, and elevators, he also dealt in Colombian drug cartels and Japanese doujinshi rings. In his haste to acquire more wealth, he overlooked paying Diana Artemiso, the leader of the Colombian Mafia.\n\nForgetting to pay the Mafia is a big mistake.\n\nDiana Artemiso, in her anger, sent a computer virus -- codename BOAR -- to destroy Calydon Enterprises's systems.\n\nNow OEneus may not have been the brightest light on the holographic chandelier, but his son was state-of-the-art. Part of his intelligence came from knowing when he needed help. To kill this invader, he brought in Theseus Macintosh, Pirithous Dell, Jason Gateway, Peleus Compaq (later father of Achilles Compaq), Telamon Pentium (later father of Ajax Pentium), and the young Nestor E. Apple II, among others.\n\nAnother, very notable addition to this group was Atlanta Windows-Microsoft, the intelligent and beautiful daughter of Iasus Microsoft, another leader in the computer industry. She had all the latest equipment, and she knew how to use it. Meleager fell in love almost instantly.\n\nThe team began by setting up a firewall and deploying search-nanoprobes.\n\nEveryone donned their Virtual-Reality visors and logged onto WorldNet. From there, they swiftly navigated their way to the source of the problem: Calydon Enterprises's main computer. The VR visors translated all of this into a marsh.\n\nThe BOAR virus detected these prodigies and lashed out, rending, maiming, and tearing the VR bodies and destroying the neural nets of one after another of Unnamed Redshirts. None of them were of noble parentage, so it wasn't any great loss.\n\nJason, unbeknownst to any of the other heroes, was trying to get to the drug deals of Artemiso, asked her help in aiming his Magneto-Spear. She allowed the MS to touch, but nothing more. She liked his desperate butt-kissing, though. Maybe she could find a use for him at Gateway Industries.\n\nIt was Atalanta of Microsoft blood, with inborn ingenuity and software stolen from around the world, with a virtual arrow charged with energy from the firewall, who made the first mark on the cyber-beast. It crackled with white-hot electricity and screamed--a harsh, unpleasant sound.\n\n\"Atalanta has disabled it!\" Meleager cried joyfully, as much to get her attention as to congratulate her.\n\nAnceus, a new employee at Calydon, with only an entry-level position, had joined this mission looking for advancement, and it didn't appear to be doing him any good. How was he supposed to impress the boss's son when this...female had just struck the first blow? Well, he'd show her.\n\n\"Is that the best you can do? Chick? Let the best do the rest.\" He charged the BOAR in t he same way Telemon had. This, and the anger of the femenist Artemiso, sent the self-absorbed little upstart to the Royal Order of Redshirts.\n\nTheseus was able to adapt one of the search-nanoprobes into a grenade launcher, using contained magnets. This owuld have been effective, but something was deflecting the missiles. Things got worse when Jason decided to try his spear again and hit his improvised launcher, effectively shortint it out.\n\nMeleager stepped to the forefront, and attacked from the side, hitting the BOAR's periphery with a blast of static electricity. He tried again, this time connecting and doing some real damage. He struck again and again, rushing and attacking.\n\nFinally, a shout went up: \"We got it!\" and raucous nerdy laughter the likes of which hadn't been seen since Revenge of the Nerds sounded throughout the Calydon Mainframe.\n\nMeleager gave the remains of the virus to Atalanta. It was only fair, since she had gotten \"first blood.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, and kissed him. Meleager was barely able to keep his mind in VR.\n\n---\n\nOnce they'd all logged out, Plexippus and Toxeus, two of Meleager's uncles who'd been in the hunting party, were jealous that Atalanta had gotten all the honor and fame out of all who had been there. They hacked into the system and stole the remains of the virus for themselves. They were the deserving ones, they rationalized.\n\nMeleager didn't see it that way. They'd taken from a heroine, and what's more, they'd taken from the woman he loved. He drew his hand phaser and vaporized them on the spot.\n\n---\n\nAlthea was relieved that Meleager had been victorious, but when her tricorder read the phaser residue of her brothers, she fries a few circuits in the ol' brain and scraps her idea for a celebration of Meleager's victory, planning a memorial service for her brothers instead.\n\nIn the heat of her anger, she uses her high-profile access to break into the ward and boots up the computer in the ward where Meleager had been taken out of incubation. She took The Disk, the one that sealed her son's fate, and began to put it into the drive. She drew her hand back, unsure if what she was planning was right. This happened four times. It's only fair, she decided. Why should OEneus celebrate while I am in mourning? An eye for an eye, I say! Well, I brought you into this world, Mellie, and watch me take you out!\n\nShe finished the download.\n\nThe :::ding::: of completion seemed to be a deathly groan. It was the groan of her son, dying. He was courageous, and handled the pain regally. His only regret that he had died by a bloodless and dishonorable death, not having his brain electricity jerked across cyberspace as he fought for his life.\n\n---\n\nWeeks later, Althea recovered from her grief and hysteria and realized what she had done. She took the coward's way out of guilt.\n\nMeleager's systers were insonsolably sad and depressed, their grief never-ending and all-powerful over them...until Diana Artemiso invited them to be citizens of CyberNation, a WorldNet community, where they all became mindless drones.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"78338\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"tearing\", \"Victim\": \"Unnamed Redshirts\", \"Perpetrator\": \"BOAR virus\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"vaporized\", \"Victim\": \"Plexippus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Meleager\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"vaporized\", \"Victim\": \"Toxeus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Meleager\"}, \"death_event_4\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"download\", \"Victim\": \"Meleager\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Althea\"}, \"death_event_5\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"drones\", \"Victim\": \"Meleager\u2019s sisters\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Diana Artemiso\"} } ```"}

It was an inhuman beauty on a human woman; she lacked the substance to fill it, and it left her with as much animation as that fragile breath of gold. A goddess would have taken that face and form and made them desirable, or commanding, or both--she could have filled them, while Helen had her human limitations. She was her husband's prize but not his beloved, a shocking and beautiful possession.\n\nAphrodite, filled with careless mischief that bled into malice, winged on by her triumph over Hera and Athena, knew this better perhaps than any mortal could, this daughter of the ocean foam or of Zeus, goddess of beauty and desire--she saw and understood that Helen, in possessing the one to such excess, could not inspire the other. And so she set that fire of want in Paris of Troy's heart and watched, knowing he would have his reward.\n\nNo man had ever spoken of passion to Helen, and all that she knew of such words she had overheard, or learned from songs; the glory of being called beautiful in tones not of cool reason but burning emotion overwhelmed her entirely.\n\nGreece was a land where she had been a thing--in Troy, she had hoped, it would be different.\n\nIt was not.\n\nIn Troy she was a catalyst, a beginning, the cause for war and destruction, and as time passed and Aphrodite's magic faded from Paris he came to see Helen as others did. And she, blindly confused at first and then with anger that grew with comprehension, railed against the gods who had brought her to this--who had allowed her to be born as she was, with a beauty she could not be--who had used her, used her as harshly as humans ever had, as a thing.\n\nParis was not what she had expected him to be--had thought he was--and her infatuation faded; but as the war continued, grinding all the men and joy of a generation down into the dust for the gods to trample, she fell in love.\n\nHector brother of Paris, son of Priam, spoke to Helen as to any other human--showed her the real kindness he did to all of his people--laid no blame on her for the horrors she had brought to him. And that honest decency caught her and held her, and burned like fire in her veins. He was among the best of men, was Hector husband of Andromache, father of Astynax, beloved.\n\nAndromache gave herself up to grief and rage when Achilles killed him, but Helen fell into herself. When the walls of Troy were breached and the towers burned, fire leaping into the skies, the pyre of her dreams--when Troy fell, Helen went numbly, cold and frozen, back to Sparta. She had children there, and their love was in its way as true and pure as Hector's had been in his. That, finally, eased away the ice from all that burning.\n\n(Centuries later, Marlowe wrote of her as one like a goddess herself, with the power and the presence that her beauty had needed. She would have laughed to hear that, had she been able to cease her weeping at the words for long enough.)\n\nNow, here, in the afterworld, where all go in their times, and our appearances are shaped by our minds, here is Helen.

She sees pain and knife-sharp memory.\n\nNot to mention anger. \"Look at your better, girl!\" The footsteps storm closer, no longer disguising the wet drag of Clytaemnestra's blood-soaked chiton or the madness breathing at the edge of her voice. Cassandra knows that madness well; it makes her laugh and laugh and laugh.\n\nLaughing, indeed, she falls to the floor, ten long years of war from all three of their perspectives filling her mind beyond capacity; it's Cassandra's that gutters and dies.\n\n\"Helen, how could you leave Sparta? Will I ever see you again?\"\n\n\"I am happy here, sister - on the days I do not weep.\"\n\n\"Do you even remember me? When we were children?

{"work_id": 49859260, "full_story": "In between the whistle of her father's blade and her death, Iphigenia had time for a single thought: Please, no--\n\n \n\n \n\nShe awoke in darkness, with still grass at her feet and a woman beside her. Her last moments flashed through her mind, mixed in with betrayal and grief. Slowly, she crumpled to her knees. The woman waited while she sobbed.\n\nSome hour or days hence, when she'd cried her eyes dry, she uncurled herself and peered up at the woman, still patiently waiting. Iphigenia took stock of the endless fields--the air as silent as the skies had been at Aulis--and the woman at her side. Iphigenia got the impression of a serene, regal woman, though she couldn't seem to focus on her face.\n\n\"The Fields of Asphodel,\" Iphigenia guessed hollowly. Her small voice dissipated in the air, and the woman nodded. \"This wasn't how it was su--supposed to. . . .\" She hiccupped, the tears beginning again.\n\nThe woman's lips pressed together sternly. \"No, it wasn't,\" she said, her voice disapproving. \"The Pantheon does not see eye-to-eye on most days, and the. . . disagreement over your sacrifice was especially bitter. Which is why we have come to see you.\"\n\n\"We?\"\n\nThe woman gave an elegant wave, and threw figures appeared behind her. \"I am the Queen of the Underworld, and I have summoned the Fates. Perhaps we can rewrite your tale.\"\n\nThe first figure stepped forward, holding a glowing spindle in her hands. \"I can re-spin the circumstances of your birth,\" Clotho offered. \"By altering your past, no longer will you be the daughter of Agamemnon, a princess of the Greeks. In your new life, you will be the daughter of a smith. You will lead a quiet, comfortable life.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she drew out the thread between her fingers, and the scene materialized directly in Iphigenia's mind: a roaring fire in the hearth, a crowded table, faceless figures that she knew would be her family. Though the scene was a happy one, bitterness tugged at her heart. Instead of that comfortable warmth, her own father had lodged a dagger in her throat.\n\n\"What will become of my family? My old family,\" she clarified. \"Who would have been sacrificed?\"\n\nShe knew the answer as soon as the words left her mouth. \"Your sister Electra,\" the figure answered.\n\nIphigenia blanched. She immediately, forcefully shook her head. \"Though your offer is a beautiful one, I cannot accept,\" she murmured.\n\nClotho nodded and melted back into the shadows, and the second figure emerged, a single shining thread pinched between her fingers. \"Then I shall create for you a different present,\" Lachesis suggested. \"I will draw out the thread of your life, extend it past its bloody end. Tomorrow, the Myrmidons will wake with no memory of today. You will be married to Achilles, best of the Greeks, as you were told. Your marriage will be the event of your generation. Your arms and hair will be adorned with gold and jewels, on your wedding day and every day after. Achilles will treat you with kindness and dignity, and you shall want for nothing.\"\n\nThis time, a new scene materialized in her mind's eye. A golden wedding to a golden husband, a glittering palace to call her own. . . and then, the scene shifted. A thousand ships stranded on the shores of Aulis, a miserable and disgraceful march home. Iphigenia saw her mother and siblings ripped from their rooms and tossed in the streets, and a new king sitting upon her father's throne.\n\nWhen the vision was over, she touched the tear tracks on her face. \"What was that?\" she whispered.\n\nThere was neither sympathy nor cruelty in Lachesis's unfeeling gaze. \"Without the sacrifice, your father's army can't sail for Troy,\" she explained. \"The people have put much into the war--in footsoldiers to fill the armies, and in material provisions. The other kings are quick to blame Agamemnon, and his favor with his people is worn thin.\"\n\n\"And my siblings? Electra, barely learning to walk, and Orestes, still a baby in Mother's arms. . . .\" Iphigenia bowed her head. She did not need to be told how a usurper king treated his predecessor's children. Electra would be made a serving girl, and later a mistress. Orestes would be ruthlessly killed, lest he one day seek revenge.\n\n\"Thank you, but I must refuse your offer,\" she murmured, and the Lachesis inclined her head before fading away.\n\nThe queen Persephone took her place. \"Then, are you content with your life as it played out, Child?\" she asked. As she spoke, she waved her arms and conjured images of the near-present and the future. Together, they watched as the ships landed upon Trojan shores. Years of war, a generation of plague, bloodshed, and death. Then, a swift return as Agamemnon and Menelaus, the triumphant brother-kings, returned to their lands and were hailed as heroes. A long, prosperous reign before Agamemnon abdicated, and Orestes ascended as the new king. In their old age, Clytemnestra forgave Agamemnon, and at long last, he died quietly in his sleep.\n\nAll this, they watched in silence, and when the last images faded away, Iphigenia stood still, trancelike, gazing at where the visions had been.\n\n\"No,\" she said at last.\n\n\"No?\"\n\nIphigenia cleared her throat, tears starting again. \"No,\" she repeated. \"I want that future for my siblings. . . for my Mother. . . but I'm angry. Furious, even! I died like a--a slaughter cow upon a slab! And I'm. . . I'm not happy to serve everyone. I should be proud. . . I should be honored. . . but I'm not. Not like this.\" She hung her head. \"I guess I'm still a child after all,\" she sighed.\n\nPersephone listened to the outburst, and then she seemed to smile. She glanced to the side, and the third figure stepped forward.\n\nDark shadows surrounded the last, stooped figure. \"I offer you revenge,\" Atropos said mildly, experimentally snipping with her golden shears. \"I cannot cut without a thread, and I cannot spin you another life, but of those that remain. . . .\" She grinned, a sly thing with too many teeth. \"I can send a whisper of intent into a ready mind,\" she said.\n\nIphigenia shivered as the images snaked through her mind: Aegisthus, a willing fool, grown too ambitious, wielding an axe placed there by Clytemnestra's hand. Her father cowering in the bath.\n\nShe closed her eyes and waited, waited for the horror to arrive. But instead of pain or remorse, something else was settling deep in her chest, something warm and filling as hot stew. Satisfaction, she realized.\n\nShe stood up straight and looked Atropos in her endless, bottomless eyes. \"Do it,\" she said.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"49859260\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"dagger\", \"Victim\": \"Iphigenia\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Agamemnon\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"axe\", \"Victim\": \"Agamemnon\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Clytemnestra\"} } ```"}

His father's death is sad but the most miserable thing is, that he left us by his own hand. And that was my fault.\n\n \n\nThe day he died I went to Mysia and fought until the team get enough goods and return. After I came back, I was shocked when people surround me immediately and curse me to die. Before I ask what happened, someone grabbed my hair harshly and said, Ajax killed all cattle and lambs then fled.\n\n\"He's gone now, so you're the one who should pay.\"\n\n\"Die, you traitor!\"\n\nMy mind was hazed. I was busy escaping death. Yes, soldiers try to crush me with rocks. When I nearly lay on the land and breath heavily, old kings stopped them. I remember Idomeneus get me up and head to the council. Sons of Atreus denounced me roughly but when Calchas put his hands on my shoulder and whispered, his words are all I concerned about.\n\n\"My son, Fate is not doomed yet. You still have time, but you must move fast.\"\n\n\"He's alive?\"\n\n\"Yes, but hurry before fates take him.\"\n\nHe swift me and I ran. No, sons of Atreus blocked me. I need to go, I demand them to let me go but they said I can't. They accused me that I'm a traitor. They said me and my brother planned to kill kings and leave Troy with treasures. I was nervous to imagine losing Ajax and was desperate to go find him, so I sent Alastor instead. After sending him first, I got out of the camp as quickly as I could and ran. My breath gets heavier and sharp pain stabbed my lungs.\n\nFinding Ajax wasn't difficult. I heard Tecmessa's shrill cry from the shore. All my hope shattered poorly. Fates took him.\n\nI cried a lot. I didn't know how to stop crying at that time. Friends told me that I was almost passed out when I first saw his corpse. They help me get up and expect orders from me. At first, I didn't know what to do. I look around and notice Eurysaces isn't here. I gasp. Breath sharply, I almost shouted.\n\n\"Where's Eurysaces?\"\n\nTecmessa quickly takes her son here, where her husband and her child's father lay. My brother's corpse. While my friends told me what happened during my absence, all my mind was fixed on Tecmessa and Eurysaces. I can't take my eyes off from them. To see them crying makes my heart hurt.\n\n\"Did he leave any will?\"\n\n\"...Ajax said you will be the child's protector. He wanted you to take him to Salamis. To king Telamon,\" Pandion said.\n\nTo Salamis.\n\n\"I see. Anything else?\"\n\nPandion shakes his head. So, that's all. Duty has fallen.\n\n \n\nIt's a hard thing to take care of a child. Especially after a battle. Every time I go out for battle, I fear that I could die immediately even before leaving my will. After my brother's death, I pray to the gods every day. I wasn't faithful before but things changed.\n\nI must be safe until I took Tecmessa and her child to Salamis. Protecting a woman and child during this endless war is a hard quest. There are many enemies in here, in our ally. Taunt, despise, rape, disregard, assault, I know these very well. They were never stranger during my childhood. After all those years, I still remember everything so vividly. How can I forget? But the child in front of me, and the woman who's sick right now are in a worse situation than mine. And I should protect them. Not just because it's Ajax's will, but I wanted to since I first saw them.\n\nEurysaces, the child who has such beautiful curly hair, soft hands and feet, blushes on his cute cheeks, and has such shining eyes, and a cheerful voice. His every expression, his every act, every word are precious. I wasn't his father but I love him, truly. How can a person hate and give no love to children? But sadly, I know and experienced them. My father, and the adults I met... some of them tried to hurt me and my own father just sit his golden throne and watched. He never helped me even when I kneel before him and begged with tears. He won't greet me and won't forgive me when I go back to Salamis. He will blame me and might order exile. No, he will.\n\nTake him to Salamis, to our father Telamon.\n\nTelamon always hated me and will curse me when I return to Salamis. I dare not wish his love for I'm a bastard and also slave-born. I think about Eurysaces. I can't certain but I think he will love Eurysaces. He's different. Eurysaces is his grandson, and he's Ajax's child... He deserves every love from his grandfather. Telamon should be, for the boy isn't a hateful child like me. I draw a picture of Telamon treating him kindly. By imagining this, my heart gets more comfort than before.\n\nNow the child closed his eyes. Tecmessa is sick today, and also she hadn't slept well this week. I should lay him in my bed and sleep tonight. At first, the boy looked awkward when he should left his mother for some time. Sure he is. But after hours later he is now tired from playing and Hypnos slowly invite the young boy to his realm. Soon Eurysaces will sleep in my arms. I hope. For I'm also tired.\n\nI brush his hair softy. Little child, my darling nephew. I never saw a pure creature than him. The day I hold his little body when he was a baby, that memory will never fade away.\n\n\"I promise there will be no harm to you,\" I whispered faintly, try not to bother his sleep.\n\nI swear to gods that I will always protect Eurysaces and Tecmessa, make no one can harm them. Even I, who might lose myself just as Ajax did. I begged to the gods have love and mercy for us.\n\nGods, let him never experience what I went through. Let him never understand the pain I experienced. Let Tecmessa won't be raped again, let her live in peace until her death. Let Eurysaces protect his mother just like his name when he becomes a grown man, unlike me.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"40607286\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"self-inflicted\", \"Victim\": \"Ajax\", \"Perpetrator\": \"self\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"Tecmessa\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unknown\"} } ```"}

And I would be his closest companion, I would never leave him, I would follow him wherever he went, even to Pelion. Pelion, where we had made so many memories. Hunting during the summer, patching up each other's wounds, waiting for snow, cleaning in the river, gazing at the stars, listening to the stories of the gods. Even if we had to go through the twelve labors of Heracles on Mount Pelion, I did not care. As long as he was by my side, it would be a treasured memory. Ones that we could not make more of. \n\nI had found a home in his heart right from the start, and he did in mine, as well.\n\n \n\nHe had already put his helmet on me, the red horsehair clashing against the gold, a loud symbol that would haunt the dreams of the Trojans. \n\n\"Do not fight, stay close to Automedon.\" He looked at me closely, checking for any signs that could give me away.\n\"I know.\" I was impatient. I could not afford to be late, I had to save his reputation, so his memory would live on, and the stories told of him would be of glory and fame. I hoped that they would tell one of his musical skills, of how his green eyes reflected happiness when he smiled, how his warm embrace felt. \n\n\"Swear it.\"\n\"I swear it.\"\nIt felt like it has been too long since these words rolled off our tongues last, tasting of the mountain air and each other.\n\nHe hesitated, and opened the flap of our tent. Automedon stood outside, spears in hand.\n\"You must bring him back to me.\"\n\"I promise, Lord Pelides.\"\nAchilles' hand found mine, and he gripped it, afraid to let me go.\nDo not worry, I thought. I will return, like you have all these years.\n\"Achilles.\" I freed my hand from his grasp at last, and turned to him, as a goodbye. I did not say anything else. The sweet declarations of love could wait after I had returned.\n\"Patroclus.\" My name caught in his throat. It sounded like Elysium in my ears, sweeter than any fig I had ever eaten.\n\n \n\nWe rode to the walls of Troy, and the Greeks recognised the helmet instantly. A cry shouted, and suddenly they fought with newfound vigor. Was this how Achilles felt? I brandished his spear in my own hand and we rode on, making sure Greeks and Trojans alike saw the mighty Achilles. I forgot when, but I stopped Automedon, and started to fight. I do not remember how many I killed, but there was the son of Zeus, Sarpedon himself. Achilles' armor had lent my strength and power, he was with me, always. I could stop this war myself, pluck Helen from the safely guarded Troy and return her to her cuckold husband. Then Achilles and Hector would not have to die. It was a plan of idiocy, and Apollo himself warned me. I tried scaling the walls of Troy again, but I fell. I did not die from the fall, in some twisted plan of the Fates. \n\nHector himself loomed over me, his spear in hand. I pleaded with him, my words slurring, but it didn't matter. It would be worth it if Achilles lived. He did not listen. It pierced through my stomach, and Hector twisted it as if stirring soup. He has killed three men with one spear, I thought bitterly. Even the throbbing pain in my stomach did not hurt as much as my heart. The Fates were cruel. As I slowly felt my soul departing, I could only think of the better days, with Achilles. Achilles. It was the last thing I thought before I saw only darkness.\n\n \n\nI watched men fight to protect my corpse from harm. I should have been going back to the camp to see Achilles, but I could not do so. How could I, when it felt like I was falling from the walls of Troy again as I watched Achilles wait for me? But knowing that he was now alone, my doubts disappeared. I raced the distance back to camp, the roads familiar. I could pretend that I was simply returning to Achilles, alive and whole, but when my feet did not tire and nobody noticed my presence, I was brought back to reality. \n\nAchilles held my body, screamed his rage for the gods to hear, from the skies to the oceans. Then he softly whispered in the ear of my cold body, sweet murmurs only for me.\n\"Patroclus.\" He says, over and over again until it is sound only. His hair lies on my skin, and for a brief moment I was sure I could feel it. \n\n\"Who has done such a thing?\" He questions, but we both know the answer.\n\"Hector.\"\nAchilles threw his golden hair back and barked out a laugh, for what has Hector ever done to him?\nHe declared that he would personally kill him.\nAgamemnon tried to talk to him, only to be met with Achilles' anger.\n\"I wish he had let you die.\"\nNo, I tried to tell him. You are sullying your reputation, what I fought for.\nHe could not listen. Instead he held my body, lifeless and cold. He would not drink or eat, food refusing to touch his lips. When we were finally alone, he moved close to me. If he wrapped me in blankets, and ignored how my chest did not heave, without any need for breathing, he could pretend that I was simply resting, a long slumber that I surely would wake from. \n\nBury me, my love. Then I can be at rest. I tried to tell him in his sleep.\n\"Patroclus!\" He sat up, looking around. \"Wait, I am here!\" He calls out into the depths of the tent, shaking my body. When I did not reply, my head hanging limply, he let out a dry sob. \n\nThen he killed and killed, filling the river with bodies of Trojans.\n'Hector.\" He shouted, the only person he cared about in that instance.\nHector begged just as I did, and met the same fate of mine.\nHe dragged his corpse around the walls of Troy for everybody to see. People started to murmur, and I could only watch from afar as he continued to destroy everything we have worked for. I was so close to him, every golden fleck in his eye visible, but he could not see me.\nDoes my death mean nothing? I asked him the night Priam collected his son's corpse, my body festering in our tent.\n\"I am one step closer to seeing you again, philtatos.\" He replied, unhearing. He finally burnt me, but I am still on this earth, waiting.\nHe continued to kill, striking down hero after hero. It was clear that he was driven only by rage, and suppressed grief.\nHe died by the arrow, aided by Apollo. He smiled as it struck him, knowing that he would finally be reunited with me. I caught a fleeting glance of him, his eyes searching the distance for somebody, not knowing that I am just behind him. Before he went, he turned his head and caught my gaze. Then he disappeared. \n\nI felt our ashes mixing. Our souls were finally complete, half of the other's. Yet one was to remain on earth, and the other was a hero in the underworld. I raged when his son did not bury us together, I wept when the Greeks sailed off. I was relieved that they at least honored him, with a tomb that bore the name Achilles, and Achilles only. I had died everyday waiting for him, thinking of reuniting in death. But now, I am afraid that I will be cursed, trapped to roam the earth forever, in search of release. It did not matter, I would continue loving him for a thousand years, if he would let me. \n\n \n\nI had no concept of time anymore. People visited his tomb, weaving tales of how he killed, how he had slain his enemies in battle. They spun stories of mine, but my name would always be followed by his. I did not mind-- even if we cannot be together in death, at least we will be remembered as half of a whole.\nTime stood still, until I saw her, emerging from the sea. She was still ethereally beautiful, carrying herself with a graceful divinity only a god could have. Her mouth stood out, red against the grayish blue hues of the sea.\n\"Thetis.\" I called for her.\nShe left.\nDay after day she came back, and I felt her presence.\nIt twisted into a frown when she sensed me, lingering at the tomb of her son, prepared to scorn me. I did not care. I would be brave, for what else did I have to lose?\n\"You said that Chiron ruined him. You are a goddess, and cold, and know nothing. You are the one who ruined him. Look at how he will be remembered now. Killing Hector, killing Troilus. For things he did cruelly in his grief.\" I gestured to the descriptions of Achilles killing.\nTo them, they will be reminded of Achilles in a battlefield, the tang of blood and the sound of war. To me, he was the taste of a fig, the musical strum of a lyre, the gold of a sun, and the green of the sea. He was half a god in his heroic tales, and half a mortal to me.\nShe is quiet, and I continue to talk, bitterness in my voice. Had I still been mortal, I would not have dared to speak to her. I would not let her take the things that reminded me of him away from me anymore.\n\n\"Perhaps such things pass for virtue among the gods. But how is there glory in taking a life? We die so easily. Would you make him another Pyrrhus? Let the stories of him be something more.\"\n\"What more?\" She says.\nFor once I am not afraid. What more can she do to me? Every breath, every hour has come to this.\nI tell her of his deeds, the ones that should be remembered. She tells me of how Pyrrhus died, and I ask if this is the son she prefers to Achilles.\n\"Have you no more memories?'\n\"I am made of memories.\"\nIt is easy to conjure up the images of the boy I have known and loved. How could I not, when I see them everyday, running through my head? I speak of our first meeting, how I grew to be his therapon, and soon, his philtatos. I speak to her of our time in Pelion, Skyros, in the camps. Achilles has always been the better speaker, but now the words run freely through my mouth, of mourning, melancholy and memories. The words are bittersweet on my tongue, and when I speak of him, I swear I can smell the faintest hits of the oils he used on his ankles. \n\nWe sit there, goddess, mortal and the boy who was both.\n\"I could not make him a god,\" she says. Her jagged voice, rich with grief.\n\"But you made him.\" I tell her, my voice raw, from talking or emotion, I do not know.\nShe does not answer me for a long time, only sits, eyes shining with the last of the dying light.\n\"I have done it,\" she says. At first I did not understand. But then I see the tomb, and the marks she has made on the stone. ACHILLES, it reads. And beside it, PATROCLUS.\n\"Go,\" she says. \"He waits for you.\"\nI am one step closer to seeing my beloved.\nIn the hopeless, heavy dusk, I see him. His hair is golden and eyes green, searching. He has been waiting for me for all these years. I cannot move, overcome by remorse and surprise. His eyes meet mine, and he runs towards me, his ankles flashing just like they did when we first met. He pulls me into a strong embrace, sobbing openly. I feel him, his flesh against mine, his tears on my shoulder.\n\"I have died everyday, waiting for you.\" He says, when he finally releases me.\nI am afraid. This has to be a trick of the Gods, and soon he will disappear in a light of divinity, an illusion. I will find myself in his tomb alone once again.\n\"Patroclus, do not be afraid. It is me.\" He says, and I know that this is not a trick.\nPat-tro-clus. It rings clear in my ears, three syllables, the perfect number of harmony, wisdom and understanding. The gods cannot imitate this, and I know he is real.\n\"I have been waiting for a thousand years.\" I tell him, my brown, owlish eyes reflected in his green ones.\n\"And I shall love you for a thousand more.\" He says with certainty.\nOur hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"38886291\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"battle\", \"Victim\": \"Patroclus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"battle\", \"Victim\": \"Achilles\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"death\", \"Victim\": \"Pyrrhus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 56246299, "full_story": "Ismene had to wait until night fell like a burial shroud over Thebes. Once the sound of weeping and shrieking had quietened, leaving the city in the midst of a stricken lull of silence, she crept down to the place where her sister's body lay. There was a guard posted at the entrance, but he ducked his head and moved away from the doorway when he saw her.\n\nThere was no will to uphold the king's authority in Thebes tonight. Not after what her uncle had done in the name of power.\n\nAntigone was poised on a stone slab, cold and unmoving. No one could have mistaken her for a sleeping girl: this was a corpse. Blue bruises at her throat, skin covered with the milky sheen of death, unnaturally stiff and hard to the touch.\n\nAnd Ismene did touch.\n\nShe ran her hands up the folds of Antigone's death robes, pushing the cumbersome fabric aside to bare the marbled, blistering skin below. Death was leaching from Antigone's pores, doing its slow insistent work of breaking down the flesh and skin. One day, not too far from this, there would be nothing left at all of her sister.\n\nBut tonight--tonight, Antigone's body was intact enough, even if her shade was already reunited with their cursed family down in Hades.\n\nIsmene leaned forward. The guard was long gone, leaving her and her grief alone with her sister. Ismene's grief was towering thing, pressing down on her from above like she was being buried alive by it. There was nothing she wanted more than to be in Antigone's place. To lie alongside her, thigh to thigh, cheek to cheek, cold heart to cold heart.\n\nShe had never been brave before, but grief sent fresh courage flowing through her veins. She clambered up onto the stone, coming to rest astride her sister's body and covering it with her own. Up close, she could see the blood beginning to pool beneath the pale skin, turning Antigone's face a mottled blue and black.\n\nOnce, she would have looked away. Now, she leaned closer, until her nose brushed Antigone's cheek. She turned her head and pressed a kiss to her sister's lips. It was cold and lifeless, nothing like a real kiss, but she persisted regardless. She wished for Antigone's hot breath against her skin, could almost imagine the whisper of it against her hair, but Antigone remained stubbornly unresponsive beneath her.\n\nDo something! Ismene's heart screamed at her wayward sister. Make this stop! Why do you always leave me behind, where I can't follow?\n\nHer palms struck out at Antigone's stiff chest, raining down blows that meant nothing. Ismene snarled and spat and shrieked at her sister's corpse, and still Antigone lay there, unmoved.\n\nSlowly, the fight leached out of Ismene. Slaps and punches softened to caresses, to soft touches from the hollow of Antigone's throat to the dip of her navel. Ismene's hands moved of their own accord, like a god was possessing them and forcing them to do things that would have made Ismene recoil in disgust. \n\nBut truly, she knew that her actions were hers, and hers alone; she could no longer remember disgust. What worth had feelings like that, now that her sister's body lay rotting before her? Antigone was dead, Ismene was mad: they were both repulsive, twinned at last in this one thing.\n\nHer sister had never wanted Ismene to be part of her when she was alive, but now she had no choice. They were in this moment, if never before and never again, inextricably bound.\n\nIsmene's hair fell over Antigone's face like a shield, hiding them both inside their own private world.\n\n\"Sister,\" she whispered, her voice cracking with the weight of all the things contained in that simple word.\n\nShe shifted, slipping a hand between her body and her sister. She could feel her own tears rolling down her cheeks, falling in hot droplets onto her sister's cold flesh. Her fingers curled into the coarse hair between her sister's legs, pushing her icy thighs apart. What was once all heat and wet and open warmth was now dry and resistant.\n\nIsmene pressed her mouth against Antigone's lips as if she could share her breath. She pushed two fingers into Antigone's cunt. It was difficult; Antigone's body had never been built to yield, and it gave even less to Ismene in death. Ismene hoped the warmth of her fingers, the throb of her pulse that she could almost feel in their tips, might melt something inside Antigone, might be the lure that led her back to the world of the living.\n\nIt was a vain hope, of course. She curled her fingers inside Antigone with all the desperation of a young husband trying to coax his new bride from her frigid fear of his touch, as if she could give Antigone anything: pleasure, pain, it was all beyond her now.\n\nIsmene rocked her hips, rubbing her cunt against Antigone's stiff, unyielding body. It was too dry, too cold, too awful--but there was a sort of triumph in it, too, a meeting of two bodies that sent sparks of hideous, shuddering heat through her.\n\nShe drew her fingers from Antigone and pushed them inside herself. She gasped and clenched around the intrusion, let her cries leak into Antigone's slack jaw as she screwed her eyes shut and forced herself to the edge of her release. She came with a painful jolt, eyelashes fluttering against her sister's cool cheek.\n\nSuddenly, with her cunt still pulsing around her fingers, the only thing Ismene could feel was blinding fury. The kind of fury that longed to tear out throats, to raze a city to ashes, to hunt down a god and kill him with her bare hands.\n\n\"I hate you,\" Ismene whispered through cracked lips as she let her full weight fall on Antigone's corpse. \"I hate you for leaving me.\"\n\nShe said it again and again, the words slurring and choked through tears of rage. They felt good to say because of how horrific they were. Each professed hatred was like a knife sliding under her flesh, unmooring her from her body.\n\n\nI hate you, I hate you, I hate you.\n\n\nBut she knew that if she forced herself to confront the truth, it was this: it was not her sister she hated. It was herself, for still being afraid of Antigone even in death. Otherwise, would she not have already chosen to follow her sister to Hades?\n\nIsmene lay atop Antigone, chest to chest--closer than she had ever been to any other human being, yet further apart from her sister than ever before.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"56246299\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"bruising\", \"Victim\": \"Antigone\", \"Perpetrator\": \"uncle\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 49531849, "full_story": "\nThough it has become as cold as the windy rain that drenched me, my heart was once as warm as the bed that waits for me. I stood on the bow of the royal Mycenean ship, breathing in the salt of the sea as if I were the figurehead made flesh, watching the choppy waves disappear one by one beneath creaking wood. Fog was on the horizon, fog was behind us . . . but I knew that were Aeolus to sweep it away, my now-ashen birthplace would not appear. The western fortress, my final destination, was still obscured by distance. I could only see where the sky meets the sea. We were alone in the water, with no past or future landing in sight.\n\n\n\nI was glad not to see a shore in the distance. The one I left was covered with a smoking ruin and the flailing bodies of wailing, ragged women. And I know the one I would land on held no happiness for me. I could already feel my captor's warm blood covering me, feeling the quick wind as the axe descends upon me, its next sacrifice. His wife will kill him from behind but will look me in the eyes when she rounded on me. He will die happily, moving inside me. His wife will have the audacity to be \n\njealous\n\n of me, who will die while her husband rapes me once again. I have prophesied the raging madness in her stare.\n\n\n\nI don't need the power of prophecy to know that I would fall ill if I remain where I am, but I far preferred being cold for a while than returning to him. Perhaps a wave might sweep me overboard and drag me under-but I knew how my life ended, and it would not be at sea. He wished to cover me in his heat, to make me warm to him, but I could not. As if as his slave I could possibly have any choice in loving him! The best I could hope for is to be resigned, for my body and soul to stop fighting the reality that I was chattel, the spoils of war. \n\n\n\nWhen I was free, I loved another, a man with whom I now regret never sharing all of myself. It was another mistake I made: a curse was put on my body as well as my tongue: should any man take me to his bed and take me fully, he would be killed not long after. I should have foreseen it...that my dear one would be slain during the city's fall regardless. Some had the good luck to die quickly, a sword to the neck or the heart. Instead, he died slowly watching me writhe in pain as a now-dead Greek ripped my virginity from my body, filling every orifice until I bled. I have already brought two men to their end, one innocent, one not, and I will again. I am She Who Entangles Men indeed.\n\n\n\nI was born to be a queen. Troy was at its height then . . . before I became a priestess, I was raised to lie in the bed of a foreign king as his consort. That I have accomplished, but I was destined to be a queen, not a slave. Agamemnon, King of Kings, rests on linens below deck, likely lying awake and anticipating my return. I will make him wait. My body will be his for the remainder of his life.\n\n\n\nOf thousands of women, he picked me, the one who didn't know how to pleasure him. And yet, he doesn't want to use me, he wants me to enjoy him. He has been patient with me, and gentle. He says he will overthrow his wife and make me queen, though I know it cannot happen: she is too sharp, too cool, and calculating-she is a woman built to survive. I do not doubt that Agamemnon truly cared for me, but I will not return to him now. My heart no longer even belonged to Coroebus, my beloved Prince of Phrygia. He is dead and now I cared for no one. \n\n\n\nI should have been content with this lot. At least when I was in Agamemnon's bed I could lose myself in pleasure for a little while. Other women were used every day by many Greeks the way I was during the fall of Troy. I heard their screams elsewhere on the ship. \n\n\n\nWhen I last embraced my mother, parting on the once-Trojan shore, I held her tear-swollen face in my hands, and leveling my green eyes to her blue bloodshot ones, told her to be happy for me. Was I not the most fortunate of Trojan women? I was to be \"married\" to the King of Kings! He takes me with his lust and also shows me kindness. He seems to \n\ncare\n\n what I think of him. Or did he merely want me to want him back so I would be a better lover?\n\n\n\nThe first night in his tent, I curled up like a baby when he touched me. I was still aching, still bleeding from the violation on Athena's altar. I feared he would do what many soldiers were doing to unwilling women: forcing them onto their hands and knees and taking them that way, rubbing their lovely faces into the dust so they won't scream. I watched the fighting from Troy's walls. I knew Agamemnon was a brutal man with a blood lust, but he never forced me-not that first night or the next. Of course, there is no consenting as a slave. All of it was rape. \n\n\n\nI think he even feared me that night; what might I do to him if I were provoked? He knew what Ajax did to me during the city's fall; what I had already experienced. He knew that I was filled with wrath and rage. Would I slit his throat in his satisfied, post-coital sleep? Would I attempt to once again invoke Athena and Apollo's wrath upon him and all the Greeks? He didn't even look at me again until the next night, when I had become numb and lay still as he explored me, trying in vain to make me rise to him. \n\n\n\nWhen I realized he wanted to pretend to make love to me, to hear what sounds I made in ecstasy, I allowed him to touch me. For those moments, as he drew out my climax, I could pretend that everyone I loved was still alive, my home was not a smoldering ruin, and that I was free. When he was done with me, I slept in a dreamless escape from this existence I could not call a life. \n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nThe ship bounced on a wave and I lost my balance, falling backward onto the deck rather than forward into the spitting sea. I clutched my side, knowing I would rise in the morning covered in bruises. I tried to stand up but was tangled in my soaked and water-heavy chiton.\n\n\n\n\"Cassandra!\" Agamemnon shouted for me, running up the steps from the hold. I said nothing, and he repeated his cry, \"Cassandra!\" He was now by my side, brushing my arm with his fingertips, \"Are you all right?\" He didn't wait for an answer and picked me up as if I were a bundle of rags. I suppose he expected me to hold him around the neck as if I were drawn to him. I let my arms hang down.\n\n\n\nHe carefully carried me down the steps into the hold, nearly banging his head as he entered. We had our own small room there, where the stolen treasures of Troy surrounded a bed. I prayed he wouldn't lay me down on it and begin to undo the brooches on my dress, telling me something heart-wrenchingly silly: that I was more beautiful than Helen, that I was the greatest treasure amongst all the plunder of Troy. Because that's what I was: plunder. I was no longer a woman, I was a thing. I was relieved when he set me down and stood me on my feet.\n\n\n\nHe stood across from me but didn't look at my face. He looked below my chin, my neck, down to where the soaked white linen revealed the darknesses of my nipples beneath. I stared blankly at him; I began to shiver violently. My whole body quaked, and I wanted to shrink to the floor and be a coddled child again. I remained silent as he again ran his hands over the droplets on my arms, brushing tears of water to the wooden floor.\n\n\n\nI remained silent as he undid the brooches of my chiton and tenderly wrapped me in a blanket and carried me to the bed. I thought of my once-great city which was now a smoking pile of ash. Mycenae would fall one day too. \n\n\n\nI remained silent as Agamemnon removed all of his garments and unraveled the blanket to press the warmth of his skin against me. He would try once again to plant life inside me. There was no use in telling him that as soon as we saw land we would shortly all be dead. I had given up on trying to make people believe me. \n\n\n\nWhat good had it done? \n\n\n\nMy father Priam was dead.\n\n\n\nMy brothers Hector, Deiphobus, Paris, Antiphus, Pammon, Hipponous, Polydorus, and Troilus are dead.\n\n\n\nMy sisters Creusa and Polyxena are dead.\n\n\n\nMy great love Coroebus is dead.\n\n\n\nMy mother Hecuba, my sister Laodice, my twin brother Helenus...all slaves now like me, headed for unknown shores. We were all once powerful in a powerful kingdom.\n\n\n\n We were Trojan.\n\n\n\nThere is no Troy anymore. Apollo will watch me sleeping elsewhere. I will see the sun setting in fiery pinks and oranges over a different horizon. \n\n\n\nAgamemnon moved his hands to spread my legs. \n\n\n\nI would die, but I knew Troy would live on in the stories told by all who knew of the dream it once was. I had foreseen it. \n\nLift up, heave up, carry the flame!\n\n", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"49531849\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Priam\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Hector\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Deiphobus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_4\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Paris\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_5\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Antiphus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_6\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Pammon\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_7\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Hipponous\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_8\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Polydorus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_9\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Troilus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_10\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Creusa\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_11\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Polyxena\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_12\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slaughter\", \"Victim\": \"Coroebus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"} } ```"}

A tragedy, and yet she memories it and carves the tale into her heart.   \n\nWhen she is still younger, they call her intuitive. She always seems to know when trouble will happen and avoids it.

If she was not the heir, they would have locked her up in a tower somewhere or sent her to a convent to be forgotten, because it is much easier to discredit than to listen.  \n\nBut she is the heir, so they do the next best thing: betroth her as soon as possible and make sure the ministry will always have more power than she does. Any supporter she has after that, the ones that call her a prophetess or a Saint, quickly dissappear. But now she has a word for what she sees: prophecies.   \n\nShe sees her mother's death long before it happens, yet cannot bring herself to mourn the woman who sealed her fate. So she doesn't cry, not at the funeral or her initial death. And the few tears she sheds are not for the late queen, but for the loss of her future. And the loss of a brother, not allowed to come to the palace to serve the insane princess. Perhaps that is what truly seals her fate.   \n\nShe sees the future in all its bloody glory, and she knows the ministry will be her end. They are foolish, quick to take insult, and quick to line their pockets. They will spark war, and people will die, and they will come for her head. They could use her foresight, but that would require hoping off their pedestals they made for themselves. And that is unthinkable to them.   \n\nSo she allows it all, does not even speak if she doesn't have too. But she thinks. Thinks of the tailor's daughter she will be soon, and thinks of that brutal fate. She thinks of the Postman, before realizing it wouldn't change much to live that way now. But most of all, she thinks of Cassandra. And little by little she realizes how very alike they are. She wonders if they are one in the same, and the next night she dreams of Troy burning, and of Ajax. She vomits afterwards, before taking a bath and trying to scrub away the skin he touched as he held her down.    \n\nWhen the revolution happens, she stands on the balcony farthest from them, though they all but surround the castle. Still, there are spots they have not circled around to. And so she looks out. And she wonders if she's willing to live a bit longer only for another Ajax or Agamemmnon to come for her. She is not. And so she jumps off the balcony. And Cassandra dies, not for the first or last time.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"48848398\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"Queen\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unknown\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"jumping\", \"Victim\": \"Riliane\", \"Perpetrator\": \"self\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"implied assault\", \"Victim\": \"Cassandra (dream)\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Ajax\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 47791900, "full_story": "Twenty years, and it seems the world has fallen apart.  Oh not for other kingdoms.  Across Greece, kingdoms were beginning to pull themselves back together, to right their world and move on from the war that had seen every able-bodied man summoned to arms.  Thebes and Pylos and Corinth and even Mycenae were now stable and thriving once more, their sons returned and their thrones filled.  Even Sparta bowed happily to their rescued Queen Helen.  Treasures from the victory at Troy filled Greek coffers and palaces.\n\nBut not Ithaca.\n\nIthaca still languished in uncertainty, her king neither returned nor declared dead.  Odysseus was hailed across Greece for his ingenuity.  It was his brilliance, so the rumors went, that conquered Troy at last, after a decade of war.  But where then was his share of the spoils of that victory?  Where was he?  And the rest of the men he'd taken with him?  Ten years had passed since Troy burned, and the King of Ithaca had vanished, leaving a kingdom and a wife in devastating limbo.\n\nA generation of young men had grown up in the meantime.  Grown up without fathers and older brothers, left with only the babes in arms and the elderly and the women, wailing and grieving their husbands.  And then, as the weeks bled into months bled into years, taking the reins of power - of their children and homes and cities - into their hands.\n\nEurynomus was one of those children.  Only twelve when the war began, told he was too young to raise a sword, he'd watched his father and elder brother leave instead with their king.  He remembered how galling it had been when word reached the island of young Prince Neoptolemus of Phthia, sailing for Troy after the death of his hero father Achilles.  Neoptolemus was younger than Eurynomus had been at the start of the war, and yet he'd been ordered to stay behind.  Stay behind and guard his family home and support his mother, but his mother refused to heed a child too young to bear arms and serve his king.\n\nWhen the years continued to pass, and returning heroes trickled home everywhere except Ithaca, Eurynomus had agreed with the other young men of his generation.  No one was coming back.  King Odysseus' vaunted divine favor had deserted him, surely he must be drowned beneath the sea, along with Eurynomus' father and brother and everyone else who'd sailed so long ago.\n\nIthaca must accept her tragedy and move on.  And the best way to show that would be in the remarriage of Ithaca's Queen.\n\nEurynomus didn't really expect wise, beautiful, Penelope to choose him.  Her cousin Helen had overlooked Eurynomus' father all those decades ago.  But Antinous had encouraged him to press his suit.  The more young men courted the Queen, the more she'd have to eventually face the harsh truth of her widowhood and the desperate need of her kingdom.  The more she'd have to choose someone.  Anyone.\n\nAnd tonight would be the final confrontation.\n\nThe Queen had put them off long enough.  Now they knew her pious pleading to finish the shroud of her (former) father-in-law was nothing but a delaying tactic, they would catch her in the act.  She would choose her next husband and king tonight.\n\n*\n\nThe maid Melantho led the pack of suitors to her mistress' quarters.  Eurynomus' fingers clenched at the sword at his hip as he skulked through the palace corridors as quietly as he could.  He saw others of his fellow suitors do the same.  Melantho stealthily opened the door to the Queen's bedchamber.\n\nAnd there she was, the deceitful jade.  Hunched over her loom, painstakingly undoing her stitches by torchlight.\n\nQueen Penelope startled as Melantho, Antinous, and Eurymachus were the first to burst inside the sanctity of her woman's chamber.  Eurynomus pushed his way forward in the middle of the crowd of men.  As they tumbled into the room, he could see Penelope's white face as she leapt to her feet.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?  How dare you violate my chamber?\"\n\n\"Us, my lady?\" sneered Antinous, reaching out to grab Penelope's arm, halting her flight.  \"How dare you deceive us like this?  You gave us your word, and we in our mercy and our respect for you and our deceased king allowed you this grace.  And now we see you committing such treachery.  Destroying your own work, which you'd pleaded to be your final act of widowhood.  No, my lady, you will choose your next husband tonight.\"\n\nEurynomus saw Penelope's face harden.  Gone was the modest, pious Queen hosting them.  In her place stood a goddess carved from marble, tall and grave, eyes flashing in contempt that sat oddly on her lovely, feminine face.\n\n\"It took you four years to discover such 'treachery'?  And I see from my maid's presence here tonight that it still wasn't your own realization.  And you - all of you - wonder why I refuse to choose any one of you as my husband?  Odysseus is alive and will return to me, I know that the same way I know the beat of my own heart or the pulse of my own blood.  But even if he were now a shade beneath the cold ground, I would never choose any one of you.\"\n\nEurynomus stared at her, frozen in place.  He could feel the blood rush to his cheeks as he saw her scorn.  The men around him also stood rooted in place by the force of the Queen's presence.  Silence hung for a moment, and Eurynomus held his breath with it.\n\nAnd then Antinous laughed, a harsh, ugly sound.  \"Then you won't choose at all.\"  \n\nHe yanked Penelope forward into his arms and clasped her tight, creasing and bunching the fragile linen of her gown.  Eurynomus heard a soft feminine gasp at the manhandling.  The small sound should have given him pause, made his heart cringe away.  But instead, something lower stirred.\n\nHis breath hitched when Antinous pulled Penelope into a rough kiss.  Penelope's lips looked so soft and red, and the sound she made was so sweet, Eurynomus suddenly wanted nothing more than to taste her.  \n\nThe man beside him leaned forward, jostling Eurynomus' arm.  Around him, men jockeyed for a better view.  He could hear others' breaths coming hot and loud as they watched Antinous kiss the Queen.  \n\nFinally, Penelope pulled away.  She was no longer the unassailable goddess as she stared at the men invading her sanctuary.  Instead, she looked shaken, frightened, smaller.  And perhaps more beautiful than Eurynomus had ever seen her.\n\nBefore anyone else could move, Antinous reached out again.  Penelope's hands came up defensively, but Antinous grabbed not for her face but the neckline of her chiton.  The loud rip of fabric made Eurynomus jump.\n\nPenelope stood before them, bared to the waist, face flushing rapidly.  Her heaving breaths matched his own in a way that captivated him.\n\nThe switch from frozen tableau to frenzied attack was sudden and brutal.  Eurymachus began it, declaring that he wanted his turn before grabbing Penelope and pulling her into a kiss of his own.  More sounds of rent fabric filled the room, along with the lustful pans of Eurynomus and his fellow suitors and the soft, unintelligible protests from the woman they all wanted.\n\nThen everyone was moving forward in a way, Eurynomus swept along, as they pushed and then dragged Penelope deeper into the room.  Toward the storied bed she'd shared with Odysseus so many years ago.\n\nThey gathered around the bed, and Eurynomus found himself at one corner.  For a moment, the significance of his surroundings distracted him.  He reached up to lay a trembling hand on the beautiful olive tree trunk that formed the bedpost.  It was said that Odysseus himself had carved this marriage bed with his own hands.  And now, it would see its mistress choose Odysseus' successor.  \n\nHe heard Penelope protest again, louder now.  When he looked, she was naked now, held still by Antinous on one arm and Eurymachus on the other.  Antinous' other hand had a tight grip on her hair, pulling her neck painfully taut.  And it hit Eurynomus then.  This was really happening.  And if he stayed the course and followed Antinous and Eurymachus' lead, he'd get his own turn in bed with the Queen of Ithaca.\n\nHe'd never be chosen, he'd always known.  But he could be part of this one night.\n\nHe winced in sympathy when Antinous threw Penelope onto the great bed, but the sight of her lovely form, bare and stretched taut, chased away his discomfort.  \n\nAfter a brief argument, Antinous asserted his leadership and claimed first place.  As other men moved in to bind Penelope's arms and long, slender legs to the bed, he took his position between her spread thighs.  \n\nEurynomus couldn't take his eyes off the scene before him.  He couldn't see much of the queen, blanketed as she was by Antinous' strong young body.  But when, screaming the loveliest sound he'd ever hear, Penelope suddenly bucked and arched, bound limbs going rigid, he knew she'd been taken.\n\n\"Don't worry, my lady,\" Eurymachus half soothed, half mocked from his place near Penelope's head.  \"You're a widow, not a virgin.  This night brings you no shame.  But after suffering your years of deception, I think we all deserve this.\"\n\nEurymachus grinned at the gathered men, and Eurynomus could swear the other looked right at him for a brief second.  Wealthy, highborn, charming Eurymachus, whom most here had privately tipped as the one to win, who had never acknowledged Eurynomus directly before in all their years in this endeavor together, had met his eyes and wordlessly promised him his due.    This might be the true prize that Eurynomus would remember from tonight.\n\nA high keening wail drew his attention back to the activity on the bed, and he quickly shook the thought away.  No.  Having Penelope, tasting and touching and taking her, was the prize.  The gift.  Even just for one night.\n\nAntinous was plundering her rapidly, hips snapping far too roughly.  Eurynomus grimaced as he watched.  Antinous' good looks and birth were enviable, but his brutishness would draw the ire of Eurynomus' father.  \n\nAntinous' mouth descended on Penelope's again, swallowing and muffling her pained screams.  And then Eurynomus saw his rhythm speed up, almost impossibly quick and erratic, slamming against Penelope's soft body over and over until, with a loud groan, it was done.\n\nEurymachus was next, of course, and soon Eurynomus saw why he'd agreed to yield first place to Antinous.\n\nEurymachus got between Penelope's thighs and slid two fingers into her spread, reddened womanhood.  Then he smiled.  \"Nice and wet for me.\"\n\nPenelope gave a low moan as Eurymachus slipped inside her.\n\nEurynomus watched with wide eyes, one hand slipping inside his own garment to palm his hardening member.  A quick glance around confirmed that he wasn't the only one enjoying the scene.  Others were stripping off and gripping their stiff manhoods.\n\nEurymachus' head was buried in Penelope's soft neck.  His lips whispered words to her that Eurynomus could not make out, but he saw her head toss and heard her soft, repeated \"No\"s clearly.  And then Eurymachus' head lifted, he smiled down at her with all his considerable charm, as if he were not at that very moment violating her.  And Eurynomus watched as Penelope spat in his handsome face.\n\nEurymachus' hand flashed up, almost too quick to follow, and cracked against Penelope's fair cheek.  Eurynomus and several others around him flinched at the sudden violence.  Eurymachus was still grinning, even as spittle dripped down his own cheek.\n\n\"How low class, my queen.  When you are my wife, I'll teach you better manners.  But if you wish to play the slattern, I suppose this is the night to do so.\"\n\nEurymachus continued his turn as if there'd been no interruption.  A few of the younger men crowded around the bed began urging him to hurry up, but he paid them no heed.  His head dropped back to her neck, and this time his lips and teeth kissed and sucked the creamy exposed flesh.\n\n\"I'll leave my mark on you, my queen.  You'll remember that I marked you first.\"\n\nWhen one young suitor suddenly spilled into his own hand and over Penelope's long dark hair, it was as if a dam had burst.  \n\nEurynomus and everyone else realized that Penelope's body was there for them, too.  Displayed for them to touch and spoil as they waited their own turns between her thighs.\n\nHe stroked her foot and delicately turned ankle, smiling at the feel of her silken skin.  Rounding the corner of the bed, he bent to run his tongue up her slender calf.  The limb, still bound fast, jumped and trembled at his touch.  Dimly, he heard her cries as others converged on her.  He tuned them out, focusing on the smooth female flesh in his hands.  He massaged her calf, fascinated by the softness, then kissed just above her knee.  It was too bad he couldn't untie her, his mouth watered at the thought of tasting the tender underside of her knee.  But he didn't dare suggest it.  Instead, he moved further up, to her thigh.  He was jostling for position now, trying to stay within reach as he butted up against other men seeking to feel her breasts, her stomach.  The third man to claim his turn inside her was between her spread thighs.  Eurynomus knew the moment he entered her, as the strong muscles in Penelope's thigh went taut, tendons straining against Eurynomus' open mouth.\n\nPenelope's cries grew louder and more strained as the night continued.  Eurynomus drank her in, one hand on his own hard manhood, as he waited his turn.  He lost his position by her thigh, and sometimes he couldn't see much of her, swarmed as she was.  Men's hands covered her breasts and hips and lovely throat.  More hands tangled in the long, dark fall of her hair, moving her head as her mouth was used. \n\nIt was oddly quiet in the crowded room, the main sounds being the slick slap of flesh on flesh and Penelope's low gags and moans.  No one, Eurynomus noticed, was interested in profaning this gift of the queen with bawdy talk.  She'd be the wife of one of them after tonight, after all.  Sometimes the one between her thighs would whisper endearments or assurances, or even soft reminders of why this was happening now.  But overall, the air of reverence held.\n\nFinally, it was Eurynomus' turn.\n\nHe got between her thighs and lined himself up, his hardness aching and almost oversensitive after such a long wait.  But the prize at the end was well worth all his patience, both tonight and over the past few years.  \n\nShe was hot, tight, and slick as he entered her in one slide.  One hand found her breast, squeezing the firm globe, while the other gripped her hip to steady them both.  Her face was streaked with tears, spit, and semen.  And her eyes, as he took her, held his, her stare burning into him even as another suitor's cock claimed her mouth.\n\nNot caring to focus on those fierce eyes, Eurynomus buried his face in her breasts.  She had the body of a maiden a decade younger than her own years.  His mouth eagerly feasted on her as his hips moved against hers, chasing his pleasure.  Lord Eurymachus' words from earlier, his boast of leaving his mark on the queen, came back to him.  He could do that too. He would never be chosen as her husband, but he could ensure that her body remembered his presence tonight.  \n\nHe sucked and bit his mark into first one breast and then the other.  He could feel her scream reverberating through his own body as he marked and claimed her.\n\nAs his climax hit, he didn't have time to draw breath and recover before someone pushed him away, demanding their ride.  Eurynomus stumbled back from the bed, legs shaking, utterly spent.  But before he melted back into the crowd, he saw the fresh bruise blooming on one perfect breast, and smiled.\n\nThe night continued.  Antinous and Eurymachus continued to direct the flow of men, and some were beginning to ask if they'd get another turn.  Eurynomus, leaning now against the thick bedpost, didn't jockey for more.himself, although he idly thought of trying the queen's mouth, just to say later that he had.\n\nBut no, it was wrong to be greedy.  \n\n*\n\nEurynomus didn't hear the drawing of the bow, but he couldn't miss the arrowhead suddenly piercing through Antinous' neck.  Blood spurted, spraying Eurynomus and the ones near him.  Eurynomus tried to reach for his own weapon, but he'd lost his belt and sword somewhere during the night.  Then the man beside him was dropping with a scream, and Eurynomus saw the arrow shaft protruding from his chest.  More screams rose around him, a harsh echo of Penelope's earlier cries.  Some part of Eurynomus recognized that her voice could no longer be heard in the fracas.\n\nScrambling for something to use as a shield, Eurynomus brought one hand up in front of himself.  Only to encounter a sudden, sharp pain.  He dropped to the floor in agony, and stared down at the arrow impaling his hand.  Blinking against the pain, he looked up and saw the cause of the sudden carnage.  \n\nOdysseus, King of Ithaca, had returned.\n\nEurynomus gaped, heart pounding and hand throbbing, mouth open in search of words that would not come.  He saw Odysseus turn towards him.  Saw the flash of a sword.  And then everything went black.

No one listened to me and now the city walls have fallen, and the great citadel of Troy is nothing but a smoking pile of stone.\n\nI know what you people say about me. 'Pity her, Cassandra, in her madness!' Or 'keep your eyes down, or else you'll bring the same god's wrath upon yourself!' Or if you're my mother: 'shut up Cassandra! Take her back to her room, would you?' It's not really your fault. You definitely won't believe me, but I might as well narrate my life to you- hey, you'll geta fun story out of it!\n\nI used to be the crown jewel of the Trojan royal family, y'know? I was the beautiful and dutiful princess, devoted to her gods, to the god Apollo before all others. I was the favoured daughter, and I could have brought the family great pride by marrying a great king of a far away place, or I could have stayed home and become a favoured priestess of Apollo.\n\nBut I was too beautiful. I was too dutiful.\n\nMen may see the attention of the gods as a good thing; see my brother Paris, favourite of Aphrodite (not that it really worked out for him), or amongst the Greeks see Odysseus and Diomedes, favoured by Athena. Men gain fame, luck, and undue honours from being a god's favourite.\n\nWomen get no such prize.\n\nNow, I was faithful to the god Apollo before all others. I would spend hours each day in his temple, serving him, devoted above all others. And thus, he noticed me. I was in the temple one night, performing the customary daily rites to Apollo, when I started to feel tired. I thought to myself, sleeping in the temple wouldn't hurt would it? I'd done it before and nothing had happened. So I pulled out a spare straw pallet, and I fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night, feeling some sort of... presence watching me. So, I wake up, I blink sleep from my eyes, and I look around. There's a glowing figure at my side, and I instantly know who it is.\n\nI've been watching you, Cassandra. He spoke. You've been so loyal, so good for me, haven't you? What if I told you I could offer you the gift of prophecy as a reward? You'd like that, wouldn't you? \n\nAnd of course, I answer yes, because prophecy? Hell yeah, who'd turn that down? And in that moment, I feel his hand on my head and I see a thousand images flash before my eyes, and its beautiful.\n\n\nYou'd do anything for me, wouldn't you? Anything I ask of you? \n\n\nAnd I answer yes to this as well, because when he says anything he asked of me, I assumed he'd ask for my eternal devotion to him. I assumed he'd ask for my life, and I'd willingly give it to him. I didn't assume he'd ask me for anything else, because I was twelve and devoting my doll to the temple of Artemis was just crossing the threshold of my mind.\n\nI was twelve.\n\nI was TWELVE!\n\nHe comes closer to me and pulls me into an embrace, and even though it's the god Apollo and he's just given me the gift of prophecy, I can't, I just can't, and I pull away from his smiling face and his face turns, and suddenly I see the displeasure in his eyes, and suddenly- A thousand of images flash before my eyes and I scream.\n\nAfter that night, I was no longer the crown jewel of Troy. I was the curse upon the royal family, a blight to be locked away. I was cursed to see the future- but no one would ever believe me.\n\nSo when I saw Paris reunited with our family, I mourned for the loss of Troy over a decade before its happening. When I saw Helen enter the citadel, I screamed my lungs out and tried to tear her beautiful head from her body, hoping the gods would see it fit for her return to her lawful husband. When I saw Andromache holding little Astyanax in her arms with Hector smiling beside them, I saw her screaming out for her baby while Astyanax had his brains dashed out on the city walls. I saw Hector's dead and defiled body, feet pinned together, dragged by Achilles' chariot. I saw my mother weep for her children on the shore. I saw Polydorus' body wash up on the shore, Polyxena with her blood seeping out into the dirt, and my father dead in the same manner as his grandson.\n\nI saw everything.\n\nI saw my own rape at the hands of Ajax the Lesser. I can still feel his hands prying me off the statue of Athena I had clung to. I can still hear my screams as I plead to the goddess to save me, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything, because have I not always given her my dues? Have I not been pious and good? People will say that she was so moved by my pleas for mercy that grey-eyed Athena's statue turned her face away from the sight, but I call bullshit. If the so-called maiden goddess truly had pity for those of her sex, she would have saved me and every woman in Troy from those damned Greeks.\n\nAnd thus now, you find me here, sitting on the shore with my family- well, the women of the family, because the men are all dead now- and the other remaining women of Troy, waiting to be picked out as war prizes for the victors.\n\nMy mother will be given to devious Odysseus, and thus will have the best fate of all of us. Poor, white-armed Andromache will be given to red-haired Neoptolemus, but will end up marrying my twin, Helenus. Polyxena is the luckiest of all, dying before she is given to someone as plunder. Helen- Helen will go back to her husband and again will become a pawn in the games of the gods.\n\nI will be given to proud Agamemnon, and he will rape me, and I will bear him twins. He will bring me to his wife, who schemes with his cousin to kill him in revenge for the murder of her Iphigenia. She will ease him up with flattery before trapping him in a net in a bathtub, like a large mackerel caught by a fisherman, and will slay him with a sword.\n\nShe will then turn to me, bloodlust in her eyes, swinging the same sword towards me. I will sit there calmly as she kills me, because I knew this was coming, and I cannot wish for death to come soon enough.\n\nI don't know why I'm telling you this, anyway.

{"work_id": 45899866, "full_story": "Prometheus looked at the fireplace. The wood had burned to embers. He knew that putting more wood on the fire would be of no use. On the other hand, to leave firewood unburnt would also be of no use, so he put some. He remembered that he had to take care of his work. Happily, he had always kept his records in order after Mecone. Nevertheless, he checked them, and wrote a note with some tips for Apollo who would take over his job.\n\nA vision appeared: As the Far-Shooter goes through the house of Zeus, the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his bow. But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus the Thunderer; and then she unstrings her son's bow, and closes his quiver, and takes his archery from his shoulders in her hands and hangs them on a golden peg against a pillar of his father's house. Then she leads him to a seat and makes him sit, and she rejoices because she bare a mighty son and an archer.\n\nThis has happened countless times. But one day, Apollo will not give his bow...\n\nPrometheus wondered what this could mean. Would the arrows bring about someone's death? This was unlikely, for none of those who dwelled on Olympus could be killed by an arrow. There were some conditionally immortal and ambrosia-dependent but they consumed enough ambrosia to become indistinguishable from true immortals. Maybe someone who had angered Apollo would receive a painful wound, or lose an eye. While Prometheus was considering this, the vision changed.\n\nThe Olympians were standing in a circle in the hall with the marble columns. Zeus was sitting on his throne, and Apollo was standing in front of him, holding a beautifully decorated jar with both hands. The jar was familiar to Prometheus from an earlier vision which had appeared when Athena had talked about contagious diseases. Now, Apollo was so eager not to drop it that his fingers were pressing it with full force, and had become white. He said to his father:\n\n'I have filled it. But let me say again that I disapprove the idea. Once we let these creatures loose, we cannot control them. They are unlikely to break through our protections but can spread to the livestock and decimate our herds.'\n\n'We'll take the chance,' said Zeus firmly. He outstretched his hands, and Apollo handed him the jar.\n\n'Hermes, bring her!' commanded Zeus. Hermes went out and soon returned, accompanied by a modest human maiden. With dismay, Prometheus recognized Pandora, Eurydamus' eldest granddaughter whom he had always disliked for no apparent reason. Now, she was bathed and girded and clothed in fine garments that looked like Athena's work, with necklaces of gold and a crown with spring flowers. She was quite pretty for a human, and prepared and adorned this way, she looked as sweet and lovely as a nymph or even an immortal goddess.\n\n'You are true to your name now, Pandora,' said Zeus, 'because all they who dwell on Olympus gave each a gift to you. Here is my gift.' He handed her the jar. 'It brings luck. But you should never open it. Now, Hermes will lead you to your future husband.'\n\nThe image faded but Prometheus figured out who the husband would be. Long ago, as if in another life, Epimetheus had stated that Zeus would find him a wife, and then at the betrothal party of Alksanor and Anthea he had said that he'd marry a human woman. Why hadn't Prometheus paid more attention? After all, it was logical for Epimetheus to be a seer like his brother, for their threads of life were identical.\n\nPrometheus briefly considered going to Epimetheus to give a more specific warning, but it was too late. He heard approaching steps, then a loud knock at the door, and the voice of Kratos: 'Open in the name of Zeus!' So he stood up and opened the door.\n\n***\nTo describe in details what followed, would be pain for the writer and not pleasant for the reader. Let's just mention that at the trial, which took place as soon as Pronoia arrived, the Cyclopes were summoned as witnesses. They testified that Prometheus had been at the forge with a stem of giant fennel, apparently to steal the fire. He denied, and then Themis solemnly stated:\n\n'There are crimes more outrageous than lying to the court, but there is hardly a crime more shameful. May he who utters a lie in this hall be afflicted by a cruel fate, and removed from our community forever!'\n\n'So be it!' said Prometheus.\n\nThemis smiled, for she did not know the truth, and thought that Prometheus was lying and had just cursed himself. Zeus, however, knew more, and though not particularly superstitious, flinched for a moment. Prometheus, however, was sad, because he thought that he would never return, and the gods would consider him not only a thief but also a liar.\n\nAfter that, Zeus pronounced the sentence of Prometheus: to be nailed to Mount Caucasus and kept bound, and every third day an eagle would swoop on him and devour the lobes of his liver, which would then grow again. As the shocked audience gasped, Zeus smiled, looking at Prometheus, and then his look turned to Pronoia.\n\nOnly then Prometheus realized that, when the punishment would exhaust his body and make him lose consciousness permanently and stop existing as a sentient being, Zeus could pronounce him dead, and force himself on Pronoia. After all, the Thunderer had sworn never to touch another god's wife, but had promised nothing about other gods' widows. Prometheus had to think fast. He remembered his conversation with Thetis, and an idea came to him that seemed good at the moment. So he said loudly:\n\n'Yet the day will come when you, Zeus, although stubborn of soul, shall be humbled, seeing that you plan a marriage that shall hurl you into oblivion from your sovereignty and throne; and then your father Cronus' curse shall be fulfilled to the uttermost. Deliverance from such ruin no one of the gods can show except me. Such an adversary are you now preparing despite yourself, a prodigy irresistible, even one who shall discover a flame mightier than the lightning and a deafening crash to outroar the thunder. Then, wrecked upon this evil, you shall learn how different it is to be a sovereign and a slave.'\n\nAs the audience gasped again, Zeus laughed and said:\n\n'Is this the best false prophecy you can invent, son of Iapetus? Falsely the gods call you Prometheus! Your pathetic attempted blackmail will not succeed, and I swear by the Styx that you shall remain chained to the crag forever!'\n\nThe same day Hermes flew Prometheus to the Caucasus, Kratos and Bia brought him to the crag, and Hephaestus bound him.\n\n***\nZeus, indeed, did not intend to succumb to blackmail. The only concession he made was periodically sending the Erinyes to give Prometheus food and water to sustain his conscious life, a detail that was not included in the original sentence. The goddesses were apparently not happy with their new job, and vented their neverending anger at the prisoner.\n\nAt night, when the pain from the wound slightly subsided and Prometheus could think a little, he sometimes saw fragmented visions of the events in the inhabitable lands across the sea. More detailed and specific, though less accurate tidings were coming from Hermes, who was visiting almost as often as the Erinyes. His mission was to try and extract from Prometheus the name of the goddess who, if being raped by Zeus, would produce a son who would take his father's throne. In return for this vital information, he promised nothing. For some mysterious reason, Hermes - and by extension, Zeus - seemed to think that Prometheus would wish to help his torturer just so, without getting anything for himself or those he loved. The titan had barely been bound when Hermes came and spoke to him:\n\n'To you, the clever and crafty, bitter beyond all bitterness, who has sinned against the gods in bestowing honors upon creatures of a day--to you, thief of fire, I speak. The Father commands that you tell what marriage you boast of, whereby he is to be hurled from power--and this, mark well, set forth in no riddling fashion, but point by point, as the case exactly stands; and do not impose upon me a double journey, Prometheus--you see Zeus is not appeased by dealings such as yours.'\n\n'Only if he releases me, and the other prisoners, and swears to leave the humans alone,' replied Prometheus. He had figured out that Zeus' oath not to release him would be easily circumvented by wearing a bracelet or even a ring with an embedded piece of the crag. But the important thing was that Zeus had no intention whatsoever to release him, under any circumstances. So the negotiations ended before they had even begun.\n\n \n\nAbout half a year later, Hermes brought news about Prometheus' family:\n'Congratulations, you have become a father! Pronoia gave birth to a son, and named him Deucalion. Such an adorable baby, it will be a pity if he suffers because of the resentment evoked by his father's deeds. Why not try and earn a little goodwill by revealing with whom Zeus should not have a son?'\nPrometheus flinched and reminded to himself that Zeus had sworn by the Styx not to hurt the children of his enemies.\n\n \n\nThe next news brough by Hermes soon after that were more political:\n\n'We are all working hard to amend the impact of your crimes, that is, giving the creatures of a day meat and fire. Do you know of the invisible things causing pestilence among mortal life? Apollo has collected many of them and placed them in a jar. It will be given to a mortal woman with a warning not to open it, under the presumption that her fear will override her curiosity for some time, so that when she finally opens the jar, it will have maximum effect. And because even a stupid female human would be suspicious if the Olympians give her a gift without a reason, it will be given as a wedding present. Yes, because she will marry your feeble-minded brother Epimetheus. Then we suppose that she will convince him to join her tribe, because humans live in swarms and his house will be too lonely for her. And we suppose that Father Zeus' advise to her not to open the jar will make her just postpone the opening until she is with her people, where the things can spread well. It is just and right that your brother will bring doom to the mortals whom you in self-will reverenced too much. They will most likely be extinct in a few years.'\n\n'No, they won't. Their bodies have good defenses. Some will survive,' said Prometheus. But he knew that many would die, most of them young children, and while this attack would be survived by some humans, the next one would not be.\n\n \n\nA year or two later, Hermes mentioned Deucalion again:\n\n'You said that the humans have good defenses against diseases, didn't you? Well, some may have but most haven't. Especially the children, they are dying in droves. Hopefully your son also has good defenses, and also good luck to save him from accidents, because he will live among the disease-ridden human tribes. He became an unbearable troublemaker, and Zeus told his mother to send him somewhere else. She could send him to her father but instead chose a savage human tribe to foster him! Your wife is apparently no less crazy than you, and your unfortunate child is suffering because of it.'\n\nPrometheus had calculated that any children he would have with Pronoia would be protected against contagion, and only in the next generation would the protections break down. He could only hope that his conclusions were correct.\n\n'This was Zeus' plan,' he said. Hermes didn't even understand what he was talking about.\n\n \n\nAbout thirty years after his binding, Prometheus started to get more and more visions about the coming flood, with the clear outlines of an inevitable future. Hermes confirmed his forebodings.\n\n'A human chieftain named Lycaon tried to serve Father Zeus a meal of human flesh,' he said. 'Father destroyed him and his family, but not one house alone deserved to perish; over all the earth ferocious deeds prevail, with all of your men conspiring in evil. Father will cleanse the earth with a great deluge, and then will people the earth with a better race, unlike this one. Athena and Hephaestus will correct everything that is wrong with the humans. So your crimes will finally be undone. You chose to give the humans beef and fire; in their lands, there will soon be no oxen, no fire, and the humans themselves will no longer be there.'\n\n'There is nothing wrong with the humans,' Prometheus objected. 'They are perfect.'\n\n'Well, I guess you are entitled to your opinion. But it will not save them. Their perfection, or lack thereof, will soon become a thing of the past.'\n\n \n\nThen Prometheus had visions of the flood in real time. Zeus gathered all the rain clouds over the inhabited land and made them pour their burden. The torrent destroyed the crops but most humans survived. Now was the turn of Poseidon, Oceanus and the river gods. Subterranean waters bursted as fountains, rivers swell, and the sea hit the land with giant waves. People, livestock, houses, shrines and trees were swept by the water mass. But when it drained into the sea, many were still alive. They were fighting the elements, building dikes, making boats and rafts. Then Zeus told all the gods that if they didn't want to suffer his wrath, they had to do the job properly this time, and not halfway as with Pandora's jar. Then Poseidon the Earth-Shaker raised his trident high and brought it down with full force. The earth shook, and the entire plain inside the mountain ring descended. The salt waters found their way and poured inside with irresistible force. Where humans had lived, was now one vast expanse, the land and sea were mingled in the waste of endless waves--a sea without a shore, dark and turbulent like new wine.\n\nWhen the goal was achieved, Poseidon raised his trident again. The submerged lands rose approximately to their previous level, and the waves calmed down. But the mountain ring still held the mass of water. Therefore Poseidon smote with his trident the narrow space between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, where the Peneus was making its way to the sea. The stroke expanded the Gate of Peneus into a deep gorge that finally let the water flow out. Much later, it would be named the Vale of Tempe.\n\n \n\nIt was actually not forbidden for gods to visit Prometheus, they just refrained from doing so. But after the flood, some Oceanids took their father's flying cart and ventured over the Caucasus. They wanted to tell Prometheus what fate had befallen the humans, so that he wouldn't hear about it only from Hermes, and also to reassure him that his son Deucalion and Deucalion's wife Pyrrha, daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora, were safe.\n\nThe Oceanids were outraged by Zeus' atrocities but at the same time too frightened to speak out loudly. And then Prometheus remembered that the Cyclopes had sworn to stop serving Zeus if the gods would renounce his rule. For the first time since the gift of fire, he saw a faint hope. He spoke to the Oceanids, fanned the flames of their anger, and made them forget their fear. And when Hermes arrived from Olympus, they openly proclaimed their rebellion. However, Zeus swore that he would stop torturing Prometheus with the eagle only if one of the ambrosia-dependent Oceanids, or another ambrosia-dependent descendant of Uranus and Gaea, would give up their ambrosia for his sake. Then he summoned a storm which dispersed the Oceanids.\n\n'Congratulations, misnamed titan!' said mockingly Hermes during his next visit. 'It was a folly to instigate a rebellion among the Oceanids. Did you really think that with a bunch of barefoot girls for an army, you could shake the rule of Zeus? If you hoped that it would make the Cyclopes switch sides, you were wrong. They preferred to break the hasty oath they had sworn, remain loyal to Father Zeus and suffer the consequences. But they will eventually recover. I am not so sure about the Oceanids. They refused to say which ones had visited you and rebelled, and I could not identify them because they were masked. So Father Zeus deprived them all of ambrosia. Those of them who are dependent will die. So, though not one of them volunteered to sacrifice herfelf for your sake, they will nevertheless die because of you. And by the way, your son proved as stupid as you. Father Zeus granted him a wish, within the limits of the normal. He could demand immortality for himself and his wife, and join our people. He could ask for your release, but apparently he couldn't care less about you. Instead, he wanted humans. He squandered his wish, because Father Zeus would populate the earth with a new generation of humans anyway. Well, I suppose that he will feel well among the new humans, because they have been made stupid like him, and maybe more. Athena and Hephaestus were eager to correct your mistake of making the humans too clever, and touched some key points in the thread of life to make them dumb. I don't think any of the new humans will ever show me a written word. And if you hope for any help from them, you'll be disappointed.'\n\nAfter some years, Hermes provided an update about the Oceanids:\n\n'Moved by the repentance of the Oceanids and the pleas of their father, Zeus in his mercy has waived their punishment. Unfortunately, it seems to have been too late for the youngest one, with the fewest protections. Despite eating ambrosia again, she continues to deteriorate. She already has wrinkles, and Apollo is pessimistic.'\n\nApollo was right. Some thirty years later, Hermes reported again:\n\n'Do you remember Leuce, the stupid Oceanid who had the folly to rebel against Zeus at your bidding? Well, she died, as expected. And she spent her last years in Hades' cave because she had become too abhorrent to show herself in public.'\n\n***\nZeus forced himself on Pyrrha, niece and daughter in-law of Prometheus, and so she gave birth to his son, and had to bring him up together with her husband. Prometheus saw in his visions the ugly scene, and then Pyrrha crying in the arms of Deucalion. Hermes preferred to keep his mouth shut about this. Otherwise, he seemed to enjoy telling Prometheus about Zeus' atrocities, especially those directed against anyone who would try to benefit the humans.\n\n'Do you know about Plutus son of Demeter?' he asked once. 'He mingled with the humans, taught them how to prosper. Father Zeus summoned him back to Olympus but he tried to hide among the mortals. Well, he was soon caught of course, and Father intends to sentence him to death.'\n\n'He shouldn't,' Prometheus said. 'Nothing to warrant death.'\n\n'Oh really? You think you have the say about other people's deserts? You are funny!'\n\nAfter some time, they had practically the same conversation about some son of Apollo named Asclepius who had become a better healer than his father and there were rumours that given enough time, he would overcome mortality itself. Hermes cheerfully stated that the youth would be thunderbolted, and there was nothing Prometheus could do about it.\n\n***\nSo the years were passing, and as Prometheus was forced to endure pain and cold he could not tolerate for long, he gradually disintegrated, disappeared, and I took his place to occupy the pathetic remnant of his body. And each third woeful day, with dreadful swoop, the eagle of Zeus with his hooked talons rent me asunder by his cruel repast. Then, crammed and glutted to the full on my fat liver, it uttered a prodigious scream and, soaring aloft, with winged tail fawned upon my gore. But when my gnawed liver swelled, renewed in growth, greedily would it return anew to its fell repast. Thus did I feed this guardian of my awful torture, who mutilated me living with never-ending pain. For fettered, by the bonds of Zeus, I had no power to drive from my vitals the accursed bird. Thus, robbed of self-defence, I endured woes fraught with torment. And this my ancient dolorous agony, intensified by the dreadful centuries, was fastened upon my body, from which there fell, melted by the blazing sun, drops that unceasingly poured upon the rocks of Caucasus.\n\n***\nOne morning in early spring, as I was sleeping in the last hours before the coming of the eagle, I heard someone calling me. I opened my eyes and saw Arce standing right in front of me. The poor one was gaunt, her eyes were sunken, and her skin was too pale even for the meager light of the dawn, as if she has not seen the sun for many centuries - which of course was the truth. A pair of engines was fastened to her back, explaining how she had reached me.\n\n'Prometheus, are you hearing me?' she asked anxiously. 'It's me, Arke. I came to see you.'\n\n'Arke...' I repeated her name.\n\n'Yes! You recognize me, don't you? I feared that you wouldn't, or you wouldn't speak.'\n\n'I am sorry...' I said, trying to apologize for my contribution to her misfortune. She understood what I meant.\n\n'Don't think of this! We are well now. We are free, we live on an island. Your mother is with us. She loves you very much. And your father, and Menoetius also send their love.'\n\nI had ruined their lives, and they still loved me. I tried to tell her to send my love to them but nothing intelligible came out of my mouth. Arce brought from her cloak a small vial.\n\n'Apollo gave me some potion,' she explained. 'He said that it would give you strength for a little while. Can you raise your head?'\n\nI tried to but could not. Arke held my forehead with one hand, and with the other poured the content of the vial into my mouth. Then she brought out a larger bottle. She shook it, then shook it again, looked inside and her face sunk with despair.\n\n'Apollo told me to give it with plenty of water... And you must be thirsty... But my water has frozen! We flew high... and now it is all ice!'\n\n'Never mind.'\n\n'Oh Prometheus! It breaks my heart to behold you like this!'\n\n'Paying for my mistakes...'\n\n'Oh please forget this! Now, listen! Zeus has sent me.'\n\nShe made a pause, apparently to be sure that I had understood her words. I raised my head. I felt stronger than I had been for many decades. Apparently the potion had begun to act.\n\n'He wants to negotiate with you,' Arke continued. 'That's why I came. Hermes came with me but hid behind that crag. Zeus told him so, fearing that if you see him, you'll refuse to speak.'\n\n'He's right.'\n\n'We flew all night over the sea with these things,' Arke pointed at one of her engines. Then she cautiously looked around and added in a lower voice, 'We didn't take the flying cart.'\n\n'I understand.'\n\n'I have a message for you, from Zeus. A hero will soon come here. His name is Heracles, and he is son of Zeus from some human woman...'\n\nI remembered Pronoia's old hypothesis - she turned out to be correct after all. The human women who had been doomed to shiver, starve, die of contagions and finally be drowned, were now considered good enough for the bed of the king of the gods.\n\n'...So Zeus ordered me to tell you that if you reveal the secret, he'll allow Heracles to kill the eagle and stop your torture,' continued Arke.\n\n'Do you know Zeus' condition?' I asked.\n\n'You mean that some dependent must volunteer to die?'\n\nI nodded.\n\n'I heard that someone has agreed but I don't know the details. You may ask Hermes about this. You'll demand him to swear an oath.'\n\n'Zeus wants me here. Didn't send the cart.'\n\n'Yes, he apparently wants to deceive you. Be careful! But you must stop being so stubborn, and then he may free you as he freed us. Don't you want to be unbound, to leave this horrible place?'\n\nI didn't answer, for I felt too weak to explain to Arke that I had nowhere to go. Even if Zeus would agree to return me to my loved ones, how could I force myself on them, after all the sorrow I had caused them? Because of me taking Zeus' side in the war, my father and my brother Menoetius had been imprisoned, and Atlas had been exiled. I had broken my mother's heart, ruined Pronoia's life, and extinguished all joy from the life of Hephaestus. The Oceanids surely hated my after my words had led to Leuce's death. And Athena wouldn't want even to look at me in my current miserable state.\n\n'Prometheus, we acknowledged Zeus' rule!' Arke continued, her voice trembling with passionate begging. 'His father Cronus acknowledged it, and your father also, and even Perses! The humans worship Zeus, build altars and temples and sacrifice to him! Only you still resist him. This is pointless! He will not fall from power - never!'\n\nShe unbound her cloak and started to take it off.\n\n'You what?' I asked.\n\n'I'll wrap you in this. You are quite cold. How didn't I figure out to take another one!'\n\n'Don't! You'll freeze on the way back.' I felt vaguely the near future and added, 'And no need.'\n\n'There is definitely a need!'\n\n'The hero will give me. Soon.'\n\n'Are you sure?'\n\n'Yes. He's near...'\n\nA loud whistling pierced the air.\n\n'You're right,' said Arke hastily. 'This is a signal from Hermes. I must leave. Please remember what I told you!'\n\nAfter these words, she turned on her engines and took off.\n\n \n\nA stranger was approaching now, carefully choosing his path up the crag. He was so tall and bulky that from a distance, one could mistake him for Kratos. He was clad in a lion's skin, holding a bow in his left hand and carrying a backpack and a quiver on his back. He apparently took after his father, for he looked like a god - I couldn't see any human features. Instead, I saw in my mind much about his past and future.\n\nThe hero stopped in front of me, looked at me in dismay, staring at my wound, then hesitantly uttered:\n\n'Hail!'\n\n'Hail.'\n\n'I am Heracles, son of Alcmene and Zeus.'\n\n'I know about you... You look like your father.'\n\n'You are Prometheus, aren't you?'\n\n'Yes. Prometheus who gave fire to mankind.'\n\n'I've heard about you... But even if I hadn't, I'd figure out that you are one of the immortals.' Heracles apparently meant that no mortal could look like this and still be alive.\n\n'Your father punished me for helping the humans.'\n\n'For how long have you been bound here?'\n\n'For as long as you have fire. Almost three centuries.'\n\nHeracles looked shocked but at the same time doubtful.\n\n'Did you perhaps transgress even somewhat beyond this offence?' he asked.\n\n'Yes. I gave the humans meat. And Zeus wanted me to reveal him something.'\n\n'Some important secret?'\n\n'His rule depends on it.'\n\n'Why don't you reveal it, then?'\n\n'Because he keeps me here.'\n\n'If you disclose it, he may release you.'\n\n'Not so easy.'\n\n'You must concede. You cannot fight against the ruler of the world.'\n\n'I can. And I do.'\n\n'I want to help you but you make it very difficult.'\n\n'I want no help... Go on your way.'\n\nHeracles was stunned. After a short silence, he caught me on my last words:\n\n'I have lost my way. I have wandered in this wilderness for days.'\n\n'I'll tell you. But first the bird must go away.'\n\n'So that about the eagle is also true? Has it caused your wound?'\n\n'You'll see.'\n\n'When will it come?'\n\n'Any moment. Look up...'\n\nI didn't need to look up myself because after all these years, I could feel the approaching eagle even without seeing it. Heracles turned his face to the sky and his expression changed.\n\n'Why didn't you tell me earlier?' he cried and sprang to action. He drew his bow, brought out an arrow and prayed: 'May Hunter Apollo speed my arrow straight!' Then he shot at his target. The eagle was pierced by the accurate arrow on the wing. Its limp body hit the rock and then fall into the precipice to crash down below.\n\n \n\n'Immense thanks!' I said. 'You are a great shooter... and of your sire, mine enemy, the dearest son. Now, about the road...'\n\n'Wait a moment,' said Heracles. He took a piece of cloth from his backpack and bandaged my wound. Then brought out a cloak and wrapped me in it. I was thirsty and wanted to ask him for water but thought better of it. Whatever water he had, would be of more use to him.\n\n'Thank you!' I said. 'Nobody has taken care of me like this... since Zeus separated me from my family. Now listen and write...'\n\n'I cannot write.'\n\n'Write on the tablet of your mind. Where do you travel?'\n\n'To Hesperia. I must retrieve some golden apples from Atlas' garden.'\n\n'It's far... And you're going in the wrong direction. You must return. Follow the straight road west... until you leave Caucasus and reach... the big water. Then to the north-west, along the coast...'\n\nAs I supplied all the information I had, Heracles was listening carefully and apparently trying to remember every word.\n\n'You'll come to the Ligurians, where you shall not be eager for battle...'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'It's fated that your arrows will fail you there, and you won't be able to take from the ground any stone, because the whole place is smooth. But your father will pity you and, holding above you a cloud, will shower the land with round stones. Hurling these, you'll drive back the Ligurian host...'\n\nHeracles was paying attention to every word, though he looked a little incredulous, especially when he heard that his father would pity him and help him.\n'And when you reach Atlas... don't step into his garden. You won't come out alive, it's full of venomous snakes. Ask him to bring the... fruit.'\n\n'The golden apples?'\n\n'Yes. I forget words,' I explained needlessly. 'You help Atlas in return. But don't let him give you all his work. Don't tell him you've seen me! He's my brother but is angry at me. But to Hades you can say that you're my friend... Your last labor will bring you to his realm. You'll have to bring Cerberus out of there...'\n\n'Oh no!'\n\n'It's less dangerous than it seems.'\n\n'But I'm not immortal.'\n\n'Just beware the Erinyes. And be polite to Hades and Kore... I mean Persephone. Try not to hurt their dog, they love him. You'll have to catch him with your bare hands. Don't touch its middle head, he hates this. Show him to Eurystheus and then return him to his owners... Then part with your wife and don't marry again! But if you do... be faithful to your new wife. If by chance you injure yourself on one of your arrows... quickly immerse the wound in hot water. As hot as you can endure, even more.\n\nI paused, thinking what else Heracles needed to know, but this seemed to be all I knew that could be useful to him. So I added:\n\n'Go now! It's too high for you here.'\n\n'I want to unbind you,' said Heracles, 'but I'm afraid of angering my father. If you agree to tell him the secret...'\n\n'It's pointless. He'll keep me here.'\n\n'Why are you so sure?'\n\n'For a term of my agony... someone of my people should give away his portion of ambrosia and die of his own free will... This is the condition.'\n\n'This cannot be true!' shouted Heracles. 'Now, what will he do? Send another eagle?'\n\n'I don't know.'\n\nHe put his backpack on the ground, sat down on it and stared into the snowy peaks at the horizon.\n\n \n\nWhile the hero was sitting, immersed in deep thought, Hermes flew in and landed next to him.\n\n'Hail Heracles!' he greeted, then turned to Prometheus: 'Why did you tell him? Why are you whining like some woman? Maybe you want to fill him with pity so that he doesn't descend in time and freezes? A single night spent at this altitude will kill him! Is this what you want? Too many people have already died because of you, enough is enough!'\n\n'Because of me?' I asked with indignation. 'Did I fill Pandora's... box? Did I make the flood?'\n\n'All this happened because of you,' insisted Hermes. 'If you are so clever, you had to figure out what the consequences of your deeds would be. The humans were doomed the moment you matched yourself in wit with Zeus, tried to trick him and gave him the worse portion of the sacrificial ox, and reserved the better portion for the creatures of a day...' Hermes stopped suddenly, realizing that he was speaking in front of a \"creature of a day\". He paused for a moment, then turned directly to Heracles: 'You need not pity this titan. For by his own proud wilfulness he brought himself to this harbor of distress. And he is a dangerous rebel. He would be unbearable if he were prosperous. You heard him first-hand that he refuses to reveal the secret he knows. He wants Zeus to fall from power, and the world to fall into chaos. Back in the past, he hoped to take your father's place after toppling him with the help of the humans. Therefore he pretended to help them but in fact used them and brought disasters upon their heads...'\n\n'That's not true!' I interrupted him. 'I wanted this not.'\n\n'Then why did you do everything? Out of pure hatred to your people?' Hermes turned to Heracles again and continued: 'In fact, this is possible. He is mad, one of those people about whom nobody knows why they are born and why they live. From one like him, you can expect anything. He had created the humans pitifully ugly and pitheci-like, and liked them this way! Zeus and other Olympians had to work hard to improve the human race. You saw that Prometheus disliked your appearance, your resemblance to Father. He was disappointed that a son of Zeus came to his rescue. Maybe he was waiting for his old friends, who were drowned because of him ages ago, to rise from the sea bottom and come to help him!'\n\nI said nothing but couldn't help flinching. Heracles was also listening in silence, and becoming paler and paler. Hermes continued, apparently not noticing his reaction:\n\n'Nevertheless, Father Zeus ceased from the wrath which he had before, and allowed you to kill the eagle so that to regard and honor you. Now, your glory might be yet greater than it was before. You must be happy and proud.'\n\nHeracles didn't reply, and seemed to be thinking of something else. Then his face brightened.\n\n'I know one who is of the divine folk and wants to die,' he said. 'My friend, the centaur Chiron. I unintentionally injured him with a poisoned arrow. Now, he is having an incurable would causing him great pain. He has told me that he wishes just to complete some affairs, and then he'll stop eating ambrosia so that he finally gets rid of his misery.'\n\n'Really?' asked Hermes, acting surprised. 'Do you think he has spoken seriously?'\n\n'I am sure. Chiron is no whiner. So if he wants to die... this means that Prometheus can be pardoned, doesn't it?'\n\n'Oh yes. If he reveals the secret, no bird of prey will visit him anymore. Heracles, you did a great job! Time to go on your way. Farewell!'\n\n'Prometheus, you'll say this great secret now, won't you?' asked Heracles.\n\nI tried to smile, with little success.\n\n'You and Chiron saved me,' I whispered. 'I knew... I knew that you would come. But so long time passed that I no longer believed... Zeus' servants kept saying that the humans wouldn't help me, ever... But you came!'\n\nHeracles looked down and blushed. Then he looked at me again and admitted:\n\n'I didn't decide it myself. Iris came to me and said that Zeus sends me to find you and rescue you from the dreadful bird.'\n\n'Doesn't matter. You came, that matters. And it speaks well of you that you told me. Thank you again! And give my thanks to Chiron. Now, go! Farewell!'\n\n'Farewell!' replied Heracles.\n\n \n\nHe turned back and walked down the narrow path. To my eyes, he soon became as small as a dot, and finally disappeared behind a turn of the path. Hermes was standing in front of me, looking satisfied by this development.\n\n'As you heard,' he said, 'the worthy Chiron sacrificed himself for you, the unworthy. This gives you a chance, if you prove that you deserve it. Come on, speak at last!'\n\nThere was something important I had to reveal, but it wasn't what Hermes wanted from me.\n\n'Listen!' I said. 'In a few years... Gaea's sons will attack Olympus.'\n\n'The giants?'\n\n'Yes... You can't defeat them without Heracles... Tell Zeus to protect him... He'll soon go to the Ligurians... You all must help him, send him stones to defend himself. Otherwise, he'll be killed and you'll be done for. I swear by Styx!'\n\n'Very well. I see that you are becoming reasonable, good! Now, all you need to do is say the name.'\n\n'If I say it... shall I be free?\n\n'No, it's impossible. You are doomed to stay bound to this crag...'\n\n'It's enough to carry a piece of it.'\n\n'Oh you also figured this out, didn't you? You can still move your brain a little when it suits you. But you are too deep in crime to be accepted back among us. First, you stole the fire and gave it to the humans...'\n\n'Don't call others thieves.'\n\n'Don't compare your wickedness to my jokes! Anyway, you have succumbed to your philanthropy - why did you then decide to anger Zeus? Had you kept your big mouth shut, the theft of fire would have been forgiven and forgotten long ago. But there's no way to fix the past. The only thing you can do now is spare yourself further suffering.'\n\n'I want back to my wife,' I said.\n\n'Back to your wife? Who told you that Pronoia is still your wife? She of course suffered greatly in the beginning, you ruined her life. But then she became accustomed to living without you, and she is well now. She first lived with Athena, then moved in with Hephaestus. He parted with Aphrodite and remarried.'\n\nThis news saddened me deeply, though I knew that I was being selfish, and I should be glad for Pronoia. Wasn't it best for her to marry Hephaestus? She didn't deserve eternal solitude, and even less did she deserve to be saddled with what her first husband had turned into.\n\nWhy return, indeed? The gods had forgotten me, or were hating me. For all this time, nobody had visited me except Zeus' messengers, the mad Io (once) and the Oceanids (once). Same for the humans. Only Heracles had come to rescue me from the eagle but this had not been his idea. And he hadn't offered me even a mouthful of water. Indeed, he had bandaged and cloaked me, so at least I wasn't naked like a beast. But this was nothing more than the humans were doing for their dead to prepare them for the funeral. And he had left me to deal with Hermes myself. This was like a final sentence. All my life, all my deeds had been a giant failure.\n\nThen I remembered another loved one, the last being who could still reconnect me to life:\n\n'I had a brother. Epimetheus.'\n\n'He has forgotten you long ago. Don't you understand that no one is waiting for you and no one wants you? You cannot see yourself from aside. You are a pathetic sight, like a skeleton covered with skin, except where you have wounds, hanging on your chains like a piece of carrion, and stinking like one. You talk in two-word sentences, worse than Epimetheus. Nobody needs you. You're good for nothing except to show what fate awaits those who rebel against Zeus. Why do you want to be free when you have nowhere to go? At least get rid of your torment. Why are you still deliberating? One could think you revel in your present plight!'\n\nI felt that Hermes was trying to deceive me, but couldn't figure out where exactly the deception was and what I should say and do. Once upon a time, I had mocked his simple mind. Fate had punished my arrogance, for I was now much dumber than Hermes had ever been. And if I were honest, I could not blame him for hating me. He was so much younger, and kin to me, and I had never done anything for him. After all, it was not his fault that he had been born and grown up in the era of Zeus.\n\nThen a sudden realization hit me like an avalanche.\n\nPronoia had ended her marriage with me, and had wedded Hephaestus. She was now the wife of another god. Even without me, she was protected. I didn't need to cling to life and suffer. I was free. And with no more mechanical birds of prey to rend me (something was telling me that Hephaestus would not produce another eagle), I could fall asleep into eternal oblivion, forever free of pain and sorrow, like Dromaeus in those long past days.\n\nOvercome with relief, I wanted to say something nice to Hermes, the last sentient being I'd speak with.\n\n'Whenever there is something important, you come.'\n\n'Yes, this is an important day for you.' He of course did not understand me. 'Now, reveal the secret, and everything will be over. Just tell me the name!'\n\nI wanted him to go away and leave me alone. I could tell Thetis' name, but why give his father what he wanted? I decided to enrage Hermes and make him lose his temper. I remembered my old prophecy that Zeus would bring misfortune upon himself if he would rape Leto, and said:\n\n'Leto. But he's already done it.'\n\n'How dare you! You hopeless scoundrel!' he shouted. He slapped me in the face, looked at his hand and thoroughly rubbed it with snow. Then, without a word, he turned back and took off.\n\nFinally alone, I looked at the white peaks and the bright blue sky which was no longer menacing. The view was beautiful, and brought peace of mind. I wanted to enjoy it for a little longer, but the effect of the potion was wearing off and my eyelids were drooping. Not trying to resist anymore, I closed my eyes.

{"work_id": 45282052, "full_story": "The dress is beautiful, so beautiful, like a living garden captured in silk, and the circlet like a ring of pure light. But she feels nervous, anxious, angry when she sees the children who bring her the gifts, these reminders of the women she's supposed to supplant.\n\nHer husband tells her it will be alright, though, encourages to take the gifts, to take all that she has been given. So she does, because she's meant to honor her husband in everything (and she saw what happened to the last women who did not, how far she fell).\n\nThe princess takes the gifts up to her room, pushes aside her concerns to savor how beautiful they are, for they  are beautiful. She lets the silk run through her fingers before taking off her own clothes so the servants can dress her, letting them style her hair beautifully enough to fit that perfect crown.\n\nWhen they're done, the woman who looks back on her is nothing less than a queen in the making, a woman truly worthy of being an Argonaut's wife. She smiles, and her reflection smiles back, cool and charming and graceful.\n\nShe shows off, because of course she does. She's young and beautiful and she wants to share that youth, that beauty, with others, and wants to know that they believe in her beauty. And a small part of her wants to savor the feeling of the dress and crown for herself, carry this beauty for herself.\n\nAnd then she feels it. Quick as a slap, but softer, so much softer, the  press of cloth against her skin in a way that she didn't think the dress pressed before. No, she knows it didn't press that way before.\n\nShe stiffens as it presses again, cloth rubbing up  between  her legs like....like a hand. Petting her. Touching her  there, where no one's mention to touch her, but her husband. She goes still before everyone's eyes, heart tight in her throat.\n\n Does that feel nice, princess?  a voice purrs at the back of her head.  Are you enjoying yourself, little thing? \n\nA cries slices out of her, shocked and frightened. One of the women watching lets out a cry in response, a sound of pleasure and triumph, and people shout about the spirit of Pan coming upon the princess, what a good omen this must be.\n\n Not Pan,  the voice whispers. The circlet is trembling ever so slightly, buzzing over the princess's skin, and her fingers shake as she presses them to her temples.  Not a god, although we do have our common traits. The voice laughs and it's--it's a woman's voice.\n\nThe voice laughs and suddenly she can feel hands all over her body, everywhere and all at once, in every place where the dress touches her skin. She looks down and there's no hands in sight, , but she can feel them pressing, plucking, stroking, squeezing all over her body: shoulders and back, knees and calves, thighs and hips, stomach and arms, her  breasts,  her  ass, her--\n\nShe falls to her knees with a sound that's half scream, half moan, nerves light up like fire and burning like poison. The dress bunches between her legs as she lands, folding neatly, almost chastely, all around her. Another moan spills from her, sharp with panic, and she can feel the people shifting around her, caught off guard.\n\n\n That's it, little slut. \nYou like it, don't you? \n\n\nShe doesn't, she doesn't, but--it's every little sprout of pleasure she's ever collected on her own, in the dark, has bloomed into a garden, choking her from the inside. She gasps for fair, hips shaking wildly as she claws at the dress, trying to get it off so that she can  think. \n\nBut it stays pressed to her flesh like it's stuck to her, like the invisible, impossible hands she can feel running all over her body. Fingers pinch her nipples as if punishment, other hands raining a barrage of noiseless smacks upon her ass, and she screams, twisting and writhing.\n\n Oh, sweet thing,  the voice hums. She can feel wetness gathering between her legs, dragging out of her like wind yanking rain from the sky.  You needed this, didn't you?  \n\nSome people are laughing, cheering. Some people are frowning with lectures in their eyes, others with fear. She reaches shaking hands towards them, begging, pleading--for what, she can't say, she can't  think. It's all too much, too much.\n\n Hush, poppet,  and the voice is just a lullaby stroking her inside and out.  I know, I know. Let me help you. The princess sobs, hips juddering frantically against the ground, humping the earth with a desperation she's never even tasted.\n\n Please,  she begs--or maybe she says, it's hard to tell.  Please please please-- \n\n Greedy little thing.  The voice is playfully chiding, almost amused.  But if you insist-- \n\nThe circlet shudders, pulsing against her temples, and she feels some of the hands start to  change, curving and shifting into--into mouths? Yes, mouths pressing against her overheated body, lips working and tugging, tongues sinking deep, and she's breathless, she's screaming, crashing over the edge with a howl.\n\nShe slumps back, damp and shaking, and that's when she realizes the hands, the mouths, are still touching her. Her body is on fire and they're throwing whole forests on the flames, dragging her back up the cliff even quicker than before.\n\n\"Please,\" she begs, staring up through blurry, dazed eyes at the world around her. \"Please, someone help, someone--\"\n\n Let me help you, then. The dress shoves itself up against her cunt, grinding against her ass. She can feel damp fingers inside her, stretching holes already slick and overwhelmed. Finger after finger, stuffing her full, and she sobs with the pleasure-agony of it.\n\n I'll fuck you better than he ever could, the woman whispers. Now, not a woman--the witch. The princess can see it now, feel the outline of a body with magic buzzing through her just as it buzzes through the circlet and the dress.\n\nShe knows who the witch is, of course she does. And she should be angry, furious, horrified, but in her mind's eye the witch looks at her with a smile and the princess comes all over again.\n\n You need more than he can give,  the witch purrs, and the fingers in her cunt curl into a fist, followed slowly, but surely by the ones in her ass.  He would have wasted you like he wasted me. You need more, my darling little bitch, and more, and more-- \n\nThe fists punch slowly in and out, rock her back and forth, and she's weeping because it is at once far, far too much and not nearly enough. There are mouths sucking her tits and biting her shoulder blades, salvia burning into her blood and pulling her raw, frantic insides into the light.\n\n More, and more, and more, and she's falling over that edge again, and again, and again. There's someone screaming around her, a wanton, fractured voice, there are people shouting about curses from Aphrodite, and inside her head that is her voice, dragging her on and on.\n\n You were born for this. You need it. And she does, she realizes, she does, because now it's her own hands dragging over her own body, over the beautiful soaking clothes that squeeze and torment her. Her cunt is full of fingers and she's trying frantically to jam more in, even it hurts, because she's been so very empty all her life and she cannot take it a second longer.\n\n Oh gods,  the voice inside her groans, soft with triumph and joy, and she repeats it, spilling herself across the grass. The hands in her pussy and start to pull out and she sobs with terror, but the voice whispers  relax, you have a guest. \n\nThen more hands reach for her and she reaches out to take them, feels them connected to a body kneeling in front of her. She doesn't know or care who it is, the witch or something else, because the voice whispers  more and she repeats it as she tackles that body to the ground, feeling between its legs for a flaccid cock that swells at her touch.\n\nThe dress lifts the skirt enough for her to pull the cock inside the aching paradise of her cunt, to press against both their bodies so her new playmate starts to shake and moan and thrust, too. She rides that cock with abandon, slamming herself down so wildly it hurts, throwing her head in time with the moans and roars inside her head.\n\n So fucking good, the witch rasps, and she is, she's so fucking good. Somewhere she's aware, distantly, that this is too much, far too much, that she's burning with real pain as much as pleasure now, but the light from the circlet and the gown and her own cooking organs drowns it all out, call waves of desperation like moths to the flame.\n\nThe rest of the world doesn't exist, not anymore. Even when the body beneath her comes, filling her insides, it only serves as a heartbeat's relief, more slick to grease her as she moves faster, and faster. She opens her mouth to weep or wail and it feels like fire pouring from her mouth, molten outside as she feels inside.\n\nThe voice is quieter now, when it says,  maybe it didn't have to be this way.  A low, weary sigh.  But oh, you feel so beautiful. It has been a long time since I felt anything beautiful. And it is too late to stop it, now. \n\nShe's not really processing the words though, not anymore. And when the voice leaves, when the circlet goes cold around her temples, the dress is still alive with motion, with hands and mouths and other things, a tangled loop of sensation that spins and spins all on its own, spins as she burns, burns,  burns..... \n\nNo one will be sure how many times the princess came before her heart gave out, overwhelmed by more pleasure and pain, more  sensation, than the human body is equipped to burn. Nobody will know how many times she had screamed the witch's name before slumping down onto the corpse of her father, whose own heart had stopped beating the very first time she dragged an orgasm from his cock.\n\nThey will only be sure that she had tears staining her cheeks as she slumped to the ground, dripping with the evidence of her ruin. And that her lips curved into the ghost of a smile, reflecting the glassy joy in her eyes as they stared up at any unforgiving sky.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"45282052\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"heart failure\", \"Victim\": \"princess\", \"Perpetrator\": \"overstimulation\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"heart attack\", \"Victim\": \"father\", \"Perpetrator\": \"princess\"} } ```"}

Black gloves, bought at Woolworth's, weren't of the quality usually demanded by the wife of the third-richest mine owner in Harlan County; but sometimes keeping up appearances meant letting down standards.\n\nShe stepped into the waiting black Cadillac with the assurance of a woman who'd been driven all her life.\n\n2\n\nHer very first Cadillac had appeared when she was walking to school, barefoot to save her shoes, on a road more stones than dirt.\n\nLooking back at herself with grown-up eyes, she saw an underfed girl who at sixteen looked no more than a city girl's twelve, still in braids, with her calico dress a little too short but no money to replace it. Her mother did miracles, farming the rocky soil and the steep mountainsides, but weather's a fickle friend.\n\nThe back door of the Cadillac opened, and Dixon Worth offered her a bag of peppermint candy to get in. She was too stupid with hunger to say no.\n\n3\n\nFor Dixon Worth's funeral, the preacher took as his text 2 Corinthians 4:8-9.

She might have meant to marry a coal-miner or go to Lexington for factory work or even chase the Hollywood men from the recording companies to get a contract singing songs older than the hills.\n\nFor less than a flicker of rain, Corrie's green eyes met the girl's clear blue gaze. The girl mouthed thank you.\n\n6\n\nCorrie had guessed when she found the pink lipstick on Dixon's silk handkerchief, but she hadn't cared until word got back through the servants that little Araminta Sizemore had tried slicing her wrists.\n\nShe'd sent a pair of cream-colored gloves--the good ones, from the shop in Lexington--with a message written small and folded into one finger.\n\n7\n\nHer own nightmares about miners involved hanged men, ropes still around their necks, accusing her.

One hand, its fingers traced with faint scars, spread over the mortar to guard the powder he was making, faintly smelling of wood and smoke and sweetness. \"There is a tale,\" he said, \"of the myrhh tree. But it is a sad one.\"\n\n\nWho Weeps?Long ago, poets told a tale that they claimed was a horrible one, that daughters and fathers should hold themselves aloof from or else disbelieve, and further, to believe more strongly in the punishment that followed the sin.\n\nA long time ago there was a girl who fell in love with her father, the king. Are you not shocked? When a man desires his daughter, we sigh and shake our heads, and if we live just lives we punish him - but we are... less surprised than we should be. Even so, here was this girl Myrrha, and she desired her father the king - Cinyras, he was called. Such a desire is unnatural and she knew it well, but she sighed and took to her bed, and swore to her maid that surely she would die. She convinced her maid to help her in the 'bed trick,' to fool old Cinyras that some other fine young lady of good birth desired him. Randy old goat that he was, he consented.\n\nWe all know the tale of the monster bridegroom who appears only in the dark, who when a candle is brought is found to be beautiful before fleeing forever. When Cinyras wondered who was this fine youthful lady who wanted him so, who reminded him of his own youth, he brought a candle in the night, and his lover was, indeed, beautiful. In his rage he raised his sword to strike his daughter down and she fled from him. In her shame and her penance, young Myrrha walked nine long months through the dry lands of the Arabs, becoming heavier with child every day. On the last day when she could walk no farther, her mouth parched with thirst, the soldiers of her lover and father still pursuing her, weary of life yet terrified of death, she cried out to Aphrodite the goddess of desire to aid her.\n\nIt is an old saying for those who are dismayed by their actions: \"a god must have put the thought in my head\" for the gods of the Middle Sea are capricious and change their minds often. The goddess Aphrodite transformed young Myrrha into a little twisted fragrant tree that split open to reveal the most beautiful baby the goddess had ever seen. She named the baby Adonis, which means Lord, except when it means Perfume, or even Lover. She kept the baby, but shared it with grave Persephone in her dark land for a part of each year. The boy grew and became a man, the most beautiful man, so of course Aphrodite would take him as her lover.\n\nAdonis was fond of the hunt. Bountiful Aphrodite, the postponer of old age, found herself kilting up her gown and running through the woods with her young lover, leaping logs, dodging through the undergrowth and telling the young man who burst with life that by all means he must be careful.\n\nObviously we all know the ending. She found Beautiful Adonis sprawled beneath a tree, a wild pig snorting over the boy, a spreading wound in her lover's thigh. She wept then as poets weep: for departed beauty, for the fragility of all things, for the idea of the dying god; she wept for worldly cares that Adonis had now left behind him. She wept until her tears and the clotting blood of her lover became the fragile anemone flower, light and frail and quick to die in its beauty.\n\nShe weeps, and we weep, for the beautiful Adonis.\n\nBut I ask you now - who shall weep for the gnarled and twisted myrrh tree that holds fast in the desert? Who shall weep for a young and silly girl whose tears are fit gift for kings?\n\n\nEdward ceased his grinding and poured the fine fragrant powder into a wooden bowl, the better to dry in the sun.

{"work_id": 37903318, "full_story": "Orpheus is signing.  \n\n \n\nHe sung, his love for me. His all consuming love for Eurydice.  My sisters with shaking hands and trepidation in their eyes wove flowers in my hair. Pretending not to noticing the deadened quake in my thighs. He had saw me dance, heard me sing. And with his lyre decided we would be. He sung his songs, plucked his instrument and all who heard believed that he and me were in love. I did not know this mortal man's name, I did not love him. But the gods loved him, his honeyed voice and strings he plucked.\n\n \n\nI could not say no....\n\n \n\n\nBelieve me. I tried.  \n\n\nOrpheus is playing \n\n \n\nMy sisters dressed me in a gown, white like our funerals.  They sang the songs they told Orpheus was love, but were the rights of our dead. Crushed lips on my berries, I can feel his rough hands on my skin. Before our marriage, pinned me down. Shoved himself between me, red is staining the white of the gown. \n\n \n\nHis white dripping down my brown thighs. \n\n \n\nOrpheus is preparing. \n\n \n\nMy sisters take my hands, the nymph I love brushes her fingers over my lips. Orpheus is ripping up her bushes.  And the last thing I have of her is the scent of her flowers when he presents me a bouquet. \n\n \n\nOrpheus is threatening. \n\n \n\nMy sisters walk me to a river, and we dance. Locked hands and slow for my shaking thighs and bruised insides to keep tempo. One touches my face, her hand is cold as she minds me of her own love. It is said she was turned to stone and her head removed.\n\n \n\nOrpheus is waiting. \n\n \n\nWith closed eyes, I trust their steps and follow suit in mine. \n\n \n\nOrpheus is watching. \n\n \n\nI felt his eyes on me, tracing my brown skin through the white gown. The curve of my hips, the swell of my breasts, the painting of blood and himself he left in my folds. His gaze is a blight upon me.\n\n \n\n\nShe had never forced me into her bed. \n\n \n\nMy friend, a viper, lies in wait. And when my foot, callused and rough lands near her; she strikes. \n\n \n\nOrpheus is wailing. \n\n \n\nHermes takes my hand, apologizes as he takes me from him.  My sisters had hidden coins under my tongue, and quickly before he can stop the god-- I spit my fair into his hand.  The god looks surprised, but with golden sandals and a winged helmet he takes me to the underworld. He believes Orpheus's lies when he said I love him.  \n\n \n\nHe spoke to me about Orpheus, his music is wonders and Apollo himself is jealous of his hands. \n\n \n\nI in turn spoke to him about the scent of her bushes, the taste of her berries, the feeling of her laugh pressed into my hair.  The soft swirl of her around me as we danced, how raspy her voice was when we sang. \n\n \n\nHer murder by his hands.\n\n \n\nHermes is silent. \n\n \n\nOrpheus is singing. \n\n \n\nThe messenger god is kind when he hands the rower my fair, I am alone when he rows me across the River Styx. I dip my hand into the river, the rower screams at me. But the nymph is one I know, and she will not harm me.  Her face appears in the reflection of mine, we are both red-eyed and swollen. \n\n \n\nThe three headed dog escorts me to his queen and his king. I kneel before them both, and I ask for my love. \n\n \n\nOrpheus is walking.  \n\n \n\nThe Queen of Dead and Flowers knows that a mortal man should have never made his home in my thighs, and she knows the nymph I have loved and followed.  \n\n \n\nShe is there, a flower blossoming in her presence.  She lifts my face, and I am able to taste her berries crushed on my lips. \n\n \n\nShe loves me. \n\n \n\nPleading, I dance, I sing, here my thighs do not ache. My insides are not bruised. \n\n \n\nBefore, I was even greater than Orpheus.  \n\n \n\nThe Queen and King cry when I tell them of the paint of blood and white on my flowers folds.  Persephone wails when I sing of the murder of my love, Hades covers his mouth when he learns the viper did what I asked. \n\n \n\nOrpheus is arriving. \n\n \n\nAs I dance, as I sing I beg them not to honor his demands. I sing as if I am sparring. Each verse is a blow to their immortal ears. His rough hands against me, his forcing himself upon me, his threatening to break my fingers and slit my throat if I dared to out play him.  The disgrace of having to be touched by him. \n\n \n\nPersephone understands me. And Hades plans for me. \n\n\n \n\n\nOrpheus is entering. \n\n \n\nThe Queen and the King listen to his plea, comparing his song to mine. I hold her hand tight. \n\n \n\nThe Queen and the King have to hold their shoulders back as he spews his lies. How I love him, the treachery of the snake, the flowers, stones and the trees crying for them. \n\n \n\nThey were not crying for him and me in mourning. They were crying for me and my love.

I feel her hands on my waist, the swell of where my womb presses against my skin and the folds of fat on my belly. I feel her love and protection heal the injuries of my half living half shade form.  Restoring me to what I am.  Her acts of rage were ones she learned from me. \n\n \n\nWe had danced before she became the queen.

Now punish him!\" said Dionysus.\n\n\nThe Maenads, mad with rage at the violation of their sacred gathering, shook the tree, upon which that royal intruder sat, so hard that Pentheus fell out of it like an apple from the branch. He rolled downhill, the women were at his heels, then he jumped to his feet and ran like the hare, dashing wildly through the forest, breaking brambles and treading thorns. His white robes, which had disguised him as one of them, fluttered like a flag in the wind and not far behind him were the Maenads, running fast like jaguars, some on two feet and some on four, all in varying states of undress. They laughed feverishly and their animal howling and screeching echoed behind him, all throughout the forest; everywhere the Maenads came after him like hounds after the fox.\n\nOut of the bramble and the thorns, Dionysus appeared in Pentheus' path. Sweet were his lips but dark his eyes, such as the gazes that lovers share in the night. \"Halt,\" he said and Pentheus stopped, held on the spot, unable to will his body any other way. \"There is that great stag, who is straying in our fields. That stag shall be my sacrifice,\" said Dionysus. \n\nHearing his call, the group of Maenads came rushing to him, approaching from all sides, encircling their rare catch. Trapped and desperate, Pentheus spun in a circle around, pleading with the women who approached him slowly now like the cat sneaking up on the mouse. \"Do you not see who I am? Underneath these robes woven with gold it is I, Pentheus, your son, your kin, your master, your king!\" He tore his headdress away, revealing himself, and some of them recognized him and some of them did not. His mother Agave saw a lion with firm loins, some saw a stag with heavy antlers, others saw a wild boar and others did see him as he was, but too great was their lust for him and their righteous anger to change their paths. \n\n\"Spoil him,\" said the twice-born Semeilos. His voice was a terrible whisper in the trees. \n\nDionysus, who breaks the chains, bestowed upon those women that, which nature had not allotted to them. He gave them the strength of beasts and the power to mend their bodies into shapes fit for their lecherous purpose. At his behest, one took her thyrsus and touched it to her loins and such transformed them into those of a man. Another followed her example but the lean girl became like a hound and another one rough and heavy-set became like a bull.\n\nThe three transformed came running on all fours like the hungry wolves and behind them followed the rest of the Maenads, dancing and singing and screaming with joy. The first of the women jumped on Pentheus as he lay prostrate, pleading at the smiling god's feet. By his power, her fingers turned into talons and she ripped the fine dress off Pentheus' back, revealing the proud warrior's body to eyes red with hunger and rage. Terrifying Pentheus trembled fearfully. He pressed his lips hotly to Dionysus's feet, kissing them in all too late reverence, but no begging would move the avenger to mercy. \n\nWanton with rage like the bulls freed of their tethers, the half-woman pulled Pentheus back into their midst and onto all fours, into the embrace of beasts. From behind she mounted him and he cried out, for it was the first time he had been used such and she used him cruelly like men use their slaves, finding his virginal clench a thing most pleasant to break. And break he did, whimpering undignifiedly, when she had her fill and then came the next, the dog and the bull and the boar and the horse and the bear, all hermaphrodite creatures with the loins of male beasts and the sweet laughter of women bellowing from their heaving breasts. \n\nTurning him over from one to the other like the drinking cup, they mounted cruelly, they kissed greedily, they scratched, they bit, they tore, and they spilled. Soon they drew blood from him, tearing like skewers into the lees of his belly. Blood was only incense to their frenzy and all greater became their brutality and the greater his cries. One, all human was she, bit his neck, blunt teeth crushing and grinding like millstones. Another took his arm and twisted it behind his back until it broke in three parts and hung slack and useless from the socket. Another drew her thyrsus, slick with honey, over his belly. Where it touched, the skin split in two like an overripe fruit, spilling dark red wine and clear clotted milk, drenching wet the ground below their feet. The last one grabbed him by the stones, pulled until they came off and swallowed them whole. Pentheus' eyes rolled in their sockets like those of the sweet heifer on the altar of sacrifice; twisting and turning, he screamed and screamed.\n\nDionysus stood unmoving. \"How you dance now, how you laugh,\" said he, \"are these not the reveries you sought to see? Oh, dear cousin, you shall enjoy my hospitality.\" At once, the Maenads, bloodied, dirty, and panting with lust, withdrew in a circle around Pentheus, who lay in a trembling heap of tatters. Then as if pulled up by a string he rose from the pool of his blood, upright and the neck stretched like a crane. Moving his fingers left and right in uncharted gestures, Dionysus made him dance beautifully. Pentheus threw his limbs left and right and his broken bones cracked the tune. The rags of his dress that hung off his body followed each move and so did his innards when disturbed by the motions they came spilling from the cleft in his stomach like flower garlands swaying in the wind. The blood splashed up high from under his soles, like water from a puddle after the rain, and mad now with pain, he foamed from the mouth.\n\n\"Look how he shakes and trembles. Listen to the moans of his ecstasy,\" said Dionysus and all that he said was true, because he willed it so that Pentheus' pain was also pleasure, two currents of water flowing from the same source. Pentheus danced, he laughed, and he cried and in that moment he saw up the river and in the currents of his own flesh, what no one had seen before him; Dionysus Mystes in his manifold forms, ever devouring and ever devoured, tearing and torn, the ceaseless hunger of the world, and he saw himself in the god's jaws, man and woman alike, moaning with pleasure as the teeth ground him to red and white gruel.\n\nThus at last by Dionysus' command and the Maenad's hands, he was torn limb from limb, split in two and three and four and ever smaller parts. The young women wreathed themselves crowns of his guts, entwining them with flowers upon their heads and the old ones drenched their greying hair in his blood as though it were the sweetest myrrh. They ate his innards still steaming hot and raw, they gnawed his flesh down to the bone and wolf cubs carried the bones away. Only his head remained in one piece; his mother Agave carried it as a trophy back to Thebes, where he was born. Meanwhile, the Maenads fell asleep in the embrace of the forest, nestling up to each other like kittens after a good meal.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"31797934\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"tearing\", \"Victim\": \"Pentheus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Maenads\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"dismemberment\", \"Victim\": \"Pentheus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Maenads\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"consumption\", \"Victim\": \"Pentheus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Wolf cubs\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 32232568, "full_story": "Cassandra, dressed as a messenger boy, found her way into the tent where the Greek Army was holding Iphigenia captive.\n\nAt first, her eyes adjusting to the dimness, she saw no one. Then what had looked like a heap of dirty laundry in the corner resolved itself into a woman, loosely covered by a stained linen cloth. The top half of her face was hidden by a mask, as if the soldiers didn't want to be reminded of who she really was. \n\nA thick rope around Iphigenia's neck was linked to a sturdy post. It had just enough slack to allow her to sit or lie down. Her ankles and wrists were not restrained at the moment, but Cassandra could see the skin was raw there from bindings used recently. And she would be bound again, come nightfall, unless Cassandra intervened.\n\nCassandra didn't want to see what they'd been doing to her, but her inexorable, inescapable prophetic vision showed Iphigenia on a narrow table, on her knees, held in the chains. Her arms stretched behind her. The soldiers sating their lust on her, roughly, while others waited their turn.\n\nThey'd been doing it for days.\n\nEver since Agamemnon had decreed Iphigenia was to be sacrificed, and Calchas had delivered her to this tent -- \"to meditate and fast and prepare,\" he'd said in the King's hearing, knowing full well what would really happen. \n\nThe soldiers used her because they were angry. \n\nAngry that they'd been forced to honor vows of allyship taken by their fathers, to leave their lands and families to take up arms over a domestic affair not their own. Angry that they'd been called to battle and then left to languish on the beach near the becalmed ships of war, because Agamemnon had to go and foolishly slay the goddess Artemis's deer. Angry because, when he'd finally decided to act, to seek the advice of the gods on how to atone for his error, he'd refused to do what Calchas -- who had the gift of prophecy from Apollo, and claimed to know Artemis's will -- had said was the necessary thing. He'd dawdled over bringing his daughter to Aulis. \n\nThey were even angry that this delicate woman was to be sacrificed to the gods, her throat cut and her heart torn out to be burned on the sacred altar. She should be gracing the household of a deserving man with her noble beauty. Bearing him strong sons. That she was captive amidst them, that they could take her with no consequence, was unnatural. It upset the proper order of things. \n\nThat they expressed all this anger by brutalizing Iphigenia night after night made no sense to Cassandra.\n\nBut little that men -- human or divine -- did to women made sense to her.\n\nStarting with the question why Iphigenia was to pay the price of her father's error in the first place. \n\nCassandra had no way of communicating directly with the gods -- except for that one god she vowed she'd sooner die than speak to again. But if she had, she'd certainly have asked Artemis about her demand that Iphigenia's blood be spilled in compensation for the death of her stag at the hands of Agamemnon. Why harm the daughter to punish the father? Was she so insensible of the difference between one human and another? If she valued the lives of her deer so much, how came it that she didn't value the life of this young woman, who had done nothing to harm her? Or, why was she satisfied to receive her as a sacrifice after her body had been sullied in this way? \n\nEven the goddesses were inscrutable to Cassandra. As one who'd received Apollo's gift -- curse -- of prophecy, she could sometimes see how they would act, but the whys were forever closed to her.\n\nIphigenia raised her head a fraction as Cassandra entered the tent. Perceiving the garb of a man, the princess shrank back, trying in vain to hide herself against the dim wall of the tent. Her mouth twisted into an expression, a combined fear and despair, that tore at the prophetess -- not only because it spoke of Iphigenia's pain, but also because it brought forth a vision of her own future, one that Cassandra hated more than any other. \n\nShe saw herself ravaged in the temple of Athena as her beloved Troy burned around her. \n\nClinging to the goddess's feet, begging for mercy, for intercession, as her clothing was torn from her. As the full weight of the armored warrior, Ajax, fell upon her, and he violated her body again and again, until she felt it slicken with blood, until she knew he had torn her fertility from her. \n\nHer tormentor made sure she saw that vision often. She'd see him, standing by in his gleaming golden sandals, his hair streaming like the rays of the sun. But as warm as was the sun, his eyes were equally as cold. \"None of this would have happened if you'd accepted me,\" he would say. \"But you refused to slake the thirst of a god who was parched for you.\" \n\nShe'd replied. Once. \"I was a human woman, Lord Apollo. I refused you nothing. How could I? Sooner say that an ant can force a tree to uproot itself and walk to another part of the forest. You wanted me, and you are a god. So, you had me. Every part of my body you wanted, you took and pleasured in, and I could not refuse you your pleasure. I could not even refuse you mine. And then you punished me, and I will live out my life never understanding why.\" \n\nApollo's face darkened in anger, the way a thunderhead blots out the sun, and he turned his face away. \n\nShe'd never spoken to him again, although he returned to taunt her.\n\n\"Lady Iphigenia,\" Cassandra said. \"I am not a man, nor sent from one. I am here to offer you succor.\"\n\n\"Stranger,\" rasped Iphigenia, \"I am parched.\"\n\nCassandra approached slowly. She slipped her small, soft hand behind Iphigenia's head to hold it steady. She put aside the mask. \n\nEven as bruised as she was, Iphigenia was one of the most beautiful women Cassandra had ever beheld. How she wished she had more time to get to know her.\n\nShe pressed the mouth of her drinking flask to the tormented woman's lips. \n\n\"Do not drink too much at any one time,\" Cassandra reminded her. \"The men are training, and then they will be at their meal, and we have some time before they will come here.\"\n\nCassandra took the dual-bladed dagger from where it was hidden in her clothing, and unwrapped it.\n\n\"I am only removing the rope. I will not hurt you,\" she reassured the princess. She cut the rope from Iphigenia's neck, then set the dagger on the ground beside them. \n\nIn between the sips of water she offered Iphigenia, she laid out the story of her curse, and her vow of revenge against the god and those he favored.\n\n\"But how will you revenge yourself against a god?\" Iphigenia said. \"It is impossible. We humans have no power against them.\"\n\n\"The only thing I can do,\" Cassandra said, \"is to end my life before worse happens to me. That way, I will at least thwart his desire to bring me a long lifetime of suffering. It is little enough. But the gods are not used to being opposed. It will gall him that I've put myself out of his reach forever, for his brother Hades is possessive of the shades he's collected and will not restore me to him.\"\n\nCassandra gave Iphigenia the flask again, then took a sip herself.\n\n\"That is where you come in. Princess Iphigenia, I offer to free you and take your place.\"\n\nIphigenia turned her huge brown eyes on Cassandra, who wanted to weep for their beauty.\n\n\"You must not! I do not deserve your life!\"\n\nCassandra got on her knees in supplication. She embraced the princess's waist, pressing her face between the small breasts, careful not to bruise them further. \"I beg you, Iphigenia.\" She touched her forehead to the woman's hands, kissed the raw wrists. \"If you grant me this, I have a request to make in return.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the doomed princess.\n\n\"I have hidden some gold -- I will tell you where -- that you might live without returning to your father's palace. I wish you to be free and to live as you choose. But should you come across other women who have been misused by gods, or men in the name of gods, and if the anger I feel speaks to you then, you have my blessing to harry them, in my name. Make them pay more than they want to pay for perpetrating such injustices. If any of my heart remains once my shade takes its place in Hades, know that I will cheer you on from that dark place.\"\n\nHer prophetic gift did not show her what would result from the request. Cassandra hoped against hope that this was because her choices would shift the flow of time, change the future into one unknown, unseen, even by the hated golden god. \n\nBut even as she hoped, she expected that Iphigenia would not believe. Would not believe any of it.\n\nIphigenia's voice was still barely louder than a whisper, but it was a little steadier than it had been. Cassandra fed her a few crumbs of wine-soaked bread, and the princess replied to what Cassandra had told her.\n\n\"The golden god asked for your body, gave you the Farsight, took you, and then decreed no one would ever believe your prophecies? But why?\"\n\n\"I did not give him my love,\" Cassandra said. \"My awe, devotion, worship, body, pleasure, yes. Those were his for the taking. It was not enough.\"\n\n\"The gods are indeed cruel,\" Iphigenia said. \"Look how Artemis has treated me, I who offered her nothing but the deepest devotion my heart could engender. No wonder you vow to deny the golden god the pleasure of your suffering. No wonder you want this even more than life itself. I do not blame you.\"\n\nThis was the part Cassandra could not see. It was strange for her now, being blind to the future, an impenetrable fog in front of her farseeing eye. \n\nShe turned to Iphigenia to offer her more bread and water, and saw the young, bruised and battered woman staring blankly at the ceiling, moving her lips slightly.\n\n\"Artemis,\" she saw those lips say, although she heard nothing. \n\nThen Iphigenia's eyes rolled back in her head, and she seemed insensible.\n\nCassandra feared she had died. But when she put her fingers on the woman's lips, her breath warmed them. So the prophetess sat by her side, watching for long moments the shadows lengthen outside the tent, moistening Iphigenia's lips with water.\n\nJust as she was beginning to truly despair, Iphigenia stirred.\n\n\"Artemis came to me, in a vision,\" she whispered.\n\n\"What did she say?\" \n\n\"She did not decree my sacrifice,\" said Iphigenia. \"Calchas the prophet lied to my father the King. She seeks revenge against him. She asked me to speak to you, Cassandra. Her brother has claimed you, and she dare not directly oppose him in this. But she will help you -- us -- if she can.\"\n\nCassandra let out an angry laugh. So even the goddesses could be rendered helpless by their male counterparts.\n\nA bitter tear brimmed in Iphigenia's eye. \n\n\"My heart aches for what you plan,\" she said. \"I do not like to think of your death. I do not want you to take my place.\"\n\n\"Think of it instead as a gift. You are letting me exercise a choice, the one choice I've ever had. The choice to say no to a god.\"\n\n\"Cassandra, I will make sure the golden god feels your wrath,\" Iphigenia said. \"Your sacrifice will not be in vain.\"\n\nThey both knew that what Iphigenia promised was impossible. A human could not revenge herself against a god.\n\nBut sometimes the only thing to do was to try.\n\nCassandra, stripped of her clothing, picked up the dual-bladed dagger, took Iphigenia's place under the cloth, and the mask covered her eyes.\n\nIphigenia, wearing the garb of a messenger boy, kissed her lips, lingering over them. \n\n\"Calchas is coming,\" she whispered. \"Sweet Cassandra, I will seek your shade in Hades when my time on Earth is at an end.\" \n\nThen she was gone.\n\nCalchas entered the tent. The eyes that alit on his false princess were glittered with cold excitement.\n\n\"Take heart, princess,\" he said in a cruelly satisfied voice that belied the kindly words. \"The ordeal ends tomorrow. Your great sacrifice will stir the winds, and the army of your father will sail forth to take Troy. You will remain forever in the memory of our people.\"\n\nHe drew close, his face hovering over her hidden one.\n\n\"Kiss me, and our goddess through me,\" he said. His hand groped between her legs.\n\nCassandra put her arm around his shoulder. \n\n\"Kiss me, Calchas, and your death through me.\"\n\nWith a mighty thrust, she yanked him down, breast to breast. Heart to heart. The dual bladed dagger sank deep into them both.\n\n\"So die two of your prophets, golden god,\" were her last words.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"32232568\", \"death_event_1\": { \"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"stabbing\", \"Victim\": \"Calchas\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Cassandra\" }, \"death_event_2\": { \"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"stabbing\", \"Victim\": \"Cassandra\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Calchas\" } } ```"}
{"work_id": 25972498, "full_story": "There were many stories about Achilles and Patroclus. Briseis knew none of them when she was captured. \n\nAll she knew was that this war had nothing to do with her, yet it had cost her her husband, her city and her freedom. When Achilles had come to her for the first time, she'd still been frozen inside, her arms still remembering the last time she'd held Mynes, her nostrils still full with the stench of the sacking of Lyrnessus. Her mind fled somewhere else as he took her, the sudden fall from the king's daughter-in-law to slave too much for her to understand.\n\nWhen one of the older slaves in Achilles' tent had shown her her new duties the next day, she'd said in a kindly voice, meant to be comforting, \"At least he's young and handsome. And he's not violent in bed. You could have done worse, child.\"\n\nIt hadn't felt like it at the time, but as time passed Briseis realised that she'd been right. The camp of the Greeks was filled with warriors far from their homes, from their wives, years of war making bloodlust second-nature to most of them. It didn't lessen the ache Briseis still felt whenever she remembered her former life, but she came to appreciate the strict discipline her new master enforced among his Myrmidons. No one except for him ever laid a hand on her, and when he did he behaved almost courteously. Closing her eyes, she could sometimes imagine he was her husband, back when Mynes had been the stranger she'd been given to in marriage. Hers had not been a love match. \n\nIt took longer for her to realise that Achilles' behaviour was not due to any particular gentleness in his character.\n\nOn the contrary, after the first real battle, not just a skirmish, Briseis shrank back at the sight of him. She'd heard of Achilles' unmatched might, yet she understood only now that fighting was his purpose, that he'd honed himself into a weapon everyone was right to fear. He certainly scared Briseis, and although she knew that it was her duty to look after her master, she hesitated to go to him, afraid of the uncontrolled violence that was still radiating from him.\n\nAs she lingered at the entrance to the tent, she realised Achilles wasn't alone. She'd seen Patroclus before of course, never far from his commander's side, the one person around whom Achilles' laugh seemed to come easily. This was especially apparent when they practised their sword play or wrestling, circling each other with wide grins on their faces. Achilles always won in the end, but even Briseis could see that their fighting resembled nothing more than a well-practised dance, their bodies recognising each other joyfully. She realised only now, gauging whether it was safe to enter, how far that recognition went.\n\nBriseis knew about the love between men and youths, of course, yet because Achilles and Patroclus were both grown men it had never occurred to her that they might still play bed games, the way she'd been told was normal among many younger men. If it had, she would likely have assumed Achilles to be the erastes - after all, despite his boyish looks, he was higher in rank, stronger, the son of an immortal. \n\nInstead the two men seemed just as perfectly matched in this as they were in their fight practice. They collided with each other with a force that sent shivers down Briseis' spine, violence turned into hard kisses and firm grasps. It was nothing that Briseis would want for herself, but between these two it seemed perfect. \n\nQuietly, she moved back, leaving them to their love. Because that was what it was, she grew more and more certain as she watched them more closely from that day on. Achilles might be gentle with her, yet it was still rape, not love. What he shared with Patroclus, however, was like a force of nature, as if neither man was quite himself unless they were together. \n\nPatroclus only spoke to her one time. He was as much a warrior as his liege, but without the dark current that seethed under Achilles' invulnerable skin. When he promised, \"He'll make you his bride once this is over,\" Briseis believed him and took it as the consolation it was meant to be. At least as the wife of Achilles she'd be inviolate, untouchable.\n\nAlready Achilles' reputation protected her during the days trapped in Agamemnon's tent, sparing her the Mycenean king's attentions, because despite all his posturing even he knew to be afraid of the Myrmidon hero's wrath. Briseis wasn't, not anymore, not as long as Patroclus was there, at Achilles' side, in his heart. \n\nTherefore her blood ran cold when she heard he had fallen, and her eyes itched with unbidden tears. What would become of her, now that Achilles had lost his anchor, his other half? Would Achilles' violence spill over when he came to her, without Patroclus to reign him in?\n\nShe never found out. \n\nAlthough supposedly all of this had been caused by a quarrel over her, when she was returned like a consolation price, Achilles had no taste for anything except grief and revenge. She was not surprised when he died at the end, in the midst of victory for the Greeks. Truthfully, he'd been half-dead already. Preparing her master for the afterlife, the tears she cried were for the kinder fate Patroclus' death had robbed her of as well as for Achilles, whose ashes would soon be mixed with those of his lover. Just like Briseis herself, he had turned out to be nothing but another victim of this war, although one that was unlikely to be forgotten.\n\nGrowing old, a slave in some Myrmidon's house, many asked Briseis about her time in the Trojan War. Briseis answered willingly, telling them of the famed Achilles, and of Patroclus, his companion. What was she but a footnote in their story, after all?", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"25972498\", \"death_event_1\": { \"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"fallen\", \"Victim\": \"Patroclus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\" }, \"death_event_2\": { \"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"death\", \"Victim\": \"Achilles\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\" } } ```"}

She was provided the best tutors, tutors who did more than teach her how to be a wife. \n\n\n \n\n\nPhilosophers, mathematicians, artists, all came through her father's court. Everything, she wanted to absorb everything. Know everything, go to all the fantastic places listed in her books.

Now you spout nonsense about traveling and choosing whom you marry. You are a woman and it is time that you behaved as such. Learn your place, Philomela or by the Gods, you will regret it.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nThat marked the end of her education, and on another level fractured her relationship with her father.

She wanted to matter, she wanted to...be seen.\n\n\n\nShe is fourteen when she falls in love. It had been nothing like the poems or stories, it had crept up on her unaware.\n\n\n \n\n\n Kallias served as one of her father's warriors, highly skilled with a sword. Just as his name suggested he was beautiful, but there was something about him that other men didn't seem to possess. He seemed more open to listening to her and her wild ideas, never judging just waiting patiently for her. Thoughts that women could be more than just wives and mothers that they could be more.\n\n\n \n\n\nHe sounded amused, yet she didn't feel as if he was mocking her, \"You mean like the Amazon women. For women to be known for their  battle strategies is this what you mean?.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Well, ye-no. Actually-\" Those women were warriors, she had no training or skill. Kallias just grinned at her, his hazel eyes twinkling. She could feel he was holding back a laugh at her expense instead.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Princess if you wanted to learn the sword all you had to do was ask.\" He said, tossing her a practice sword. It fumbled to the ground, but he tilted his head for her to pick it up. She hesitated for all but a moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo she did, those first few days were brutal, her hands stung from the popped blisters, but she felt empowered. They trained away from private eyes, yet she never felt unsafe in his presence.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt happened on a warm spring afternoon when neither of them had expected it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A well-rounded education isn't complete without a mastery of weapons,\" he teased, adjusting her bow. Her sword work wasn't terrible, but a bow or dagger felt more at home in her hands. Kallias had told her to play to her strengths.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"You say that as if I'm terrible at the sword.\" Philomela couldn't help but rise to his taunt, \"then what does that say about your teaching.\" Releasing the arrow, it whipped through the air finding rest in the target. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Hmm, I must not be that bad of a teacher if you can hit the target. Just imagine if you were on the battlefield, you would be down right deadly.\" His breath ghosted at her ear, as he placed another arrow in her hand.\n\n\n \n\n\n Already she felt her cheeks warming from his body heat, \"Aim again,\" he continued, obvious to her red face and thumping heart.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"The first one was pure luck.\" Instead of aiming for the target, tilted her head so that his lips were right near her cheek. \n\n\n \n\n\nThen the bow dropped into the grass as she grasped his face, taking in his surprised expression.\n\n\n \n\n\n Hazel eyes widened, flushed cheeks, she would say it was a rather good look on him, \"Princess?\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Yes?!\" she started to regret having been so bold. The thought had been for nothing their lips inched closer and closer together slowly as if giving her time to stop him.\n\n\n \n\n\nShe didn't.\n\n\n\nThey were playing a dangerous game, but neither of them realized just how much. She was to be wedded. When she did not know, knowing her father he was glad to be rid of her after his new queen gave him a son. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"He praised your beauty, I think you will be married come this fall. What do you think, daughter?\" Her father asked, turning to her. \n\n\n \n\n\nPhilomela could have scoffed now he asked her opinion, smothering her displeasure plastered on a smile \"Wonderful, father. I think a wedding held in spring would be much more lovely. Please father, I had hoped for a wedding with the flowers blossoming.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nMenoetius, while thankfully near her age, unnerved her. The last time they met he did little but stare at her-no it was if he was undressing her with his very eyes. It was obvious he would not be a kind husband, hoping she would be obedient in bed and bear his squealing little heirs. If not- the thought brought a chill to her, her only choice was to escape. Time all she needed to do was bid her time.\n\n\n \n\n\nHe considered this, \"Yes you'll be fifteen then, I think another year would not hurt. Surely he can wait for my beautiful Philomela.\" \n\n\n \n\n\nYes more time for her to wriggle out of this arrangement. \n\n\n \n\n\nBowing slightly, to her father, \"Thank you father.\" He dismissed her. Bowing one last time, she let her hair hide her expression.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTruly, father.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThey had named her sweet singer for nothing. For all that fell from her tongue would be honey glazed poison all she had to do was weave them and like songs they would fall on willing ears.\n\n\n\nWords were more powerful than one realized. For the moment words are spoken, they are truths, lies, half-truths,half-lies, songs, poems, ties that bind. \n\n\n \n\n\nKallias had damned them both the moment he said, \"Marry me, Mela. Run away with me.\" His hazel eyes shining as he cupped her cheek. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Be mine and I'll be yours.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I-.\" She wanted to tell him that it was foolish, that she couldn't but the words wouldn't come. Not when his love was so earnest. \n\n\n \n\n\nYet, the words tumbled so quickly from her lips,\"Yes.\" All she wanted was to be his and all he wanted was to be hers. If giving up everything for the unknown future was foolish then she didn't want to be rational. Kallias saw her, he saw her heart.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Really Mela, my Mela.\" By the Gods and she had thought her tongue deadly, he was so open and free with his love. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Yes.\" She sealed their vow with a kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromises were easy to make and break but so much harder to keep. \n\n\n\nUnder the cover of nightfall, she hurried down the steps, he was waiting for her at the entrance of the gate. In a few moments the guards would close the gates. She could only hope that she would make it in time. She would be free.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Philomela. Stop this instant.\" Her blood ran cold, no it couldn't be. Just as when he had stopped her education, he was going to stop this too. No, no she wouldn't let him. They fought and he slapped her, but she pulled away.\n\n\n \n\n\nShe hurrying to get away from him when suddenly she was pulled back. \n\n\n\nHe had her by the hair, struggling against his grip she miscalculated the step and suddenly she was falling. Falling, falling, it almost felt like mercy when she finally touched the ground, and darkness took her.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen she awakened, found that awareness came in hazes, everything was hot. Tossing and turning gave her no relief from the heat that seemed to engulf her body. It was scorching, vaguely she felt the cool rags placed at her forehead however it wasn't long before until those too burned like flames. \n\n\n \n\n\nShe was dying, that much she knew was true. All she could pray for was that Hades would take her sooner rather than later.\n\n\n \n\n\nYet she didn't die, it had taken weeks to rise from her bed. Weeks of fever and torment. Weeks of laying in the dark wondering what happened to him.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeep in her heart she already knew, if her father was willing to try to beat her to death then there was no hope for him. By the Gods how she longed to weep, but found that it hurt too much to simply do that. \n\n\n \n\n\n\nMela\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOne by one tears fell of their own accord. \n\n\n \n\n\n\nMela, I love you.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRun away with me.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIt hurt, the agony of it. It was like pouring salt in her already torn and bloodied heart. He was dead but his voice was so clear in his mind. His face, his smile. He was gone. Just gone.\n\n\n\nBy fifteen, she is married. \n\n\n \n\n\nStanding at the altar, she blankly stared at her veil. Today is not one of her most lucid days, nor would she have wanted it any other way. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe wedding is a quick and rushed affair, her husband is eager to unveil her. She could tell by the way his greedy hand wretched off her veil. He hadn't even had the decency to wait until the feast.\n\n\n \n\n\nPhilomena didn't even flinch as light flittered into her vision, taking in his disgust at her dull eyes. \n\n\n \n\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\n\nAt sixteen she becomes a mother.\n\n\n \n\n\n The child unwillingly placed in her womb. All of her husband's talk of taking lovers had been empty. He stole to her bed when it pleased him and took his liberties as he wished. Even with her mind scrambled, she was lovely enough and men couldn't help but think with their cocks. To exercise what power they thought they possessed over those perceived as weaker than them. \n\n\n \n\n\nSo for months she struggled with pregnancy, wishing for it to end for. For hers and the child sakes, they couldn't be happy living with such a miserable man. Then slowly she began to love the little one in her belly, with them there she didn't feel so alone. Joy began to replace the horror of what had been done to her. All she wanted was to hold her baby, love him or her as much as she was able. She wanted to live if only for the child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike her own birth, he was quiet for a moment before wailing his displeasure at the coldness of the room. What she could glimpse of him in the midwife's arms he had taken most of her features. Inky curls and her dark skin. Stretching out her arms, she wanted to hold him just this once. If they took him now, she would never hold him again. Menoetius would make sure of it. \n\n\n \n\n\nOne of the midwives moved away and swaddled something, a moment later a pillow was placed in her arms. A pillow, heat built up behind her eyes, a pillow her mind repeated. She could only cradle it in sorrow, a replacement for the baby she would never hold.\n\n\n\n\nGlory to the Father\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPatroclus he is named, and then he was whisked away to be raised by nannies and tutors. Philomela wept for days after he was taken, what could she do. She had no way to advocate her sanity which on a day could widely shift, speaking was hard to do as her tongue would not move except to make noise. Vague grunts and moans nothing resembling words, it never ceased to frustrate her. So he grows up away from her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n She rarely ever gets to see him outside scheduled and supervised visits as he is the heir to his father's kingdom. He is the reason that her husband no longer bothers her for another child. Healthy and robust, if a bit thin, but she herself had always been slight. Patroclus favours her, all the court whispers. He does, but she finds he takes more after his grandmother than her completely, as his curls are darker and wilder and his cheeks are higher. However his eyes and freckles are all hers. \n\n\n \n\n\nApparently he favors her greatly in how well he does in his studies. He loves mathematics and literature, never before has she been so grateful for gossiping maids. Without them she would never know of her little boy. \n\n\n\nAt twenty-four.\n\n\n \n\n\nHer son hates her, and she doesn't blame him for she loves him just the same. How could he ever know the truth, that she was all but trapped in her mind. \n\n\n \n\n\nIt is as if the Gods mock her for on days he does visit. She can do little but smile and blink. Patroclus her son views her with little veiled disgust, no doubt his father's poisoning at work. Yet, he is not cruel to her, for he seems to pity her. They were both at  Menoetius' mercy. Her son more so, her husband beat her son for any little thing, taking out his frustration at having a slow yet beautiful wife. What was the point if she was little more than an empty pretty made up doll. A healthy but in his eyes useless son who focused little on athletics and more time in books.\n\n\n \n\n\nHow she wishes she could have more lucid days, days where she could try to communicate with him, comfort him. So she tries humming to him lullabies her mother once sang to her, and slowly the disgust and pity leave his eyes. He often says little but comes closer to her to rest his head in her lap as she pets his hair. These moments were so precious to her, she wouldn't trade them for the world. Her child, her little Patroclus.\n\n\n \n\n\n___________________________________________\n\n\n\nOn one particular day her son comes to visit her, the Gods are smiling upon her. Her mind feels clear for once so she gestures as well as she can to the window overlooking the shore.\n\n\n \n\n\nHer clever son understands and together hand and hand they march to the beach. There are servants milling in the background, but she focuses solely on her son. \n\n\n \n\n\nHow his eyes turned to liquid under the Sun's bright rays, she could only marvel at how tall he had gotten. Philomela knelt down for just a moment, there was a flurry of movement behind her to reach her but her son came over first. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Mother are you alright?\" She hummed letting him know she was okay. Finishing taking off her sandals let the sand fully sink around her toes, the tide was coming in. \n\n\n \n\n\nPatroclus joined her and they took in the sunset over the sea, casting everything awash in reds, oranges, and purples.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThey stood there for a while until stars began to dot up over the horizon. Her son bowed to her promising to visit her again. She smiled at him.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOf course my son.\n\n\n\n\n Patroclus is eight, and Philomela is dying. There is nothing she can do about it, her time has come. After all her wishing, all she can do is feel regret, regret that she was leaving her son all alone to fend for himself against that heartless monster. Against the world.\n\n\n \n\n\nTaking her final breath, she prays to any God above that her son would be happy. That is all she could ask for.\n\n\n\nDying isn't painful as people describe it, more like a relief. Nor is the Underworld as dark and gloomy as the stories make of it. \n\n\n \n\n\nHere she is free. Free to be reunited with her mother and brother. \n\n\n \n\n\nFree to....\n\n\n \n\n\n\"\n\nMela.\"\n\n\n\n\nPhilomela was meticulous in counting her time since she had come to the Underworld. Everytime a war was mentioned she worried that one day she would see her son among the newly arrived. Even if she was eager to see him again, all she wanted to know was that if he lived a good life, if he had fallen in love, gotten married, had grandchildren. Yet, nothing.\n\n\n \n\n\nWars came and went still nothing, yet one day she happened to ask a soldier about the most recent war. The Trojan War that had sent so many young souls to Hades.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Excuse me,\" she asked, touching the young man's shoulder. He appeared to be distressed, so many of them came crying or in pain, but he looked up at her dry eyes. So she pressed on, \"Have you heard of Patroclus? Son of Menoetius.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nHis whole being seemed to light up, \"Yes, have you seen him? I'm searching for him too.\" The young soldier trailed off quietly, \"He should be here....\"\n\n\n \n\n\nShe shook her head, \"I only ask because I'm his mother. I have missed him for so long and now I'm finally able to speak to him.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nHe appeared to be surprised by her admission, \"Yes, of course how could I have not seen it. You both look so much alike.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Did you know my son well?\" Aha finally someone who knew of her little boy. However if it was true then her son could have very well died in battle. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Yes, my lady. I did he was...\" his cheerful demeanor appeared to dim. Before she could lose him she pleaded with him to tell her everything about him.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Then would you mind telling me of him. Please.\" Even if it was just crumbs she wanted to know him, and then she would hear it all over again when she saw him again.\n\n\n \n\n\nFrom the soldier she learned that Menoiteus had exiled him to Pthita for a supposed murder of another boy. Part of her was horrified that he would so cruelly cast out her child only a year after her death. Another part of her was relieved that he had escaped her ex-husband.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Was he happy there?\" she asked him.\n\n\n \n\n\nHis emerald eyes twinkled, \"I should hope so. He says the years spent there were his happiest.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I'm glad.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nThen he told of the war, how her son used his skills taught by the great Chiron, trainer to demigods. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"He saved lives, men who did not expect to see the next day, drawn back from the brink of death. He was admired by many.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"What of love? Was he loved?\" At this the soldier's eyes filled with tears.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"He is loved, this I can promise you. I love him, he is my very soul.\" Philomela did not press him for any more stories and the young man sobbed in her arms for what felt like days. \n\n\n \n\n\nAchilles, she came to know. He had been ashamed to tell her his name for what he perceived as a betrayal to her son. Born a demigod, was her son's lover. She approved, her son had excellent taste. Handsome, polite, and adored the very ground her son walked on. All that a mother could want for her child.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I was selfish, I didn't realize what I had until it was too late. I would trade it all if I could see him again hold him again, my lady.\" No doubt the Gods had a hand in had occurred most of the wars reeked of a child's chess game.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"None of this my lady, call me Philomela. My son loves you and I too think of you as my family. Come meet the others, my son has not come yet, but I feel that he will come soon. So come Achilles, he would not want you to sit here and grieve.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"My lady, I'm not worthy of your-\" she stopped him grabbing him. What a funny sight they must have made, a waifish woman dragging a full-grown warrior back to where her family waited.\n\n\n \n\n\nShe turned back, giving him what Kallias called her \"you must obey me for you will never win smile.\" She hoped Patroclus had at least inherited it.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Nonsense, he loves you enough to die for you then we will love you too. There is nothing one can do when he sets his mind to something, none can stop him. I once labored with him for days because he was a stubborn little thing. We will not condemn you nor will he. He loves you.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I-,\" Hmm, he wasn't fully convinced. No matter, she had one last card to play.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"You have told me your stories, would you like to hear mine?\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Stories of Patroclus.\" His tone held a wistful longing. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"He was a very chubby babe, and stubborn too. Did I tell you that I was in labor for days with him...\"\n\n\n \n\n\nAchilles fits nicely in with her family. Kallias took him under his wing, they both spent hours talking strategy and weapons. Her mother cooked for him and her little brother piled his arms with toys. She still went out speaking with the newly dead. Nothing yet.\n\n\n \n\n\nBut she knew more of her son and had his very heart.\n\n\n\nDays, weeks, months, and years passed. \n\n\n \n\n\nAchilles was anxious but she would not tell him just how long it had been.\n\n\n \n\n\nA millennium or two give or take. She knew it only based on how the newly arrived would speak and dress. Why wasn't her son here? Achilles said they had been buried together but they had not arrived together. All of them had doubts but they dared not speak them around Achilles. The poor dear was already so guilty and grief-stricken. Patroclus had not been buried properly so perhaps that was the delay. Yet she wasn't going to give up hope.\n\n\n \n\n\nThen one day Achilles startled them all when he suddenly ran off. He truly lived up to his name with those swift feet of his. Philomela followed him as quickly as she could.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the river, Achilles embraced; a dark skin youth with curly hair. There is only one person whom he would embrace like so.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Patroclus,\" she called out, disturbing the couple. Achilles finally let her son's feet touch the ground against. My~my how passionate.\n\n\n \n\n\nHe turned to face her and tears fell. Here was her son all grown up, strikingly tall and slim, their same dark eyes. She now noticed the blood marrying his tunic at the abdomen. A gruesome death, however the signs would fade in time.\n\n\n \n\n\nReaching for his hands, noted the rough nature of them. Hands that had saved but also ended lives, her baby.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Mother.\" His voice was so different compared to its once soft lilt, but he was her son. Finally she could hold her son and this time.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I'm sorry-\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Ssh, my love,\" drawing him so that he could hear her heartbeat, \"you didn't know you were too young and I couldn't tell you.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I've missed you so much my son and,\" his eyes were damp when she drew back, \"I'm sure you have much to discuss with me. However it has come to my attention that you are keeping a very handsome man waiting. He has been waiting for a long time.\" \n\nNot as long as me but he is so grief-stricken just as fresh as the day her son died. His love never wavering, and besides who was she to stand in the way of soulmates.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Mother-.\" Dare she say he sounded embarrassed. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Go on.\" She chided all but shoving him into the demigod's arms. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe way they took each other's hands so gently, she startled when Kallias wrapped his arm around her. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"He favors you,\" he whispered. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"He does.\" Thank the Gods for small mercies, even at his age she could still only see her mother and herself reflected in him. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"No wonder Achilles is so mad for him. A face of such beauty and kindness few can resist.\" She whacked him slightly in the ribs, he coughed a bit.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Be nice and if my son is handsome then that is no crime. He is my son so of course he inherited both my good looks and wit.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"And besides you're one to talk,\" she added just to make a point. The reunited couple kissed as if they would disappear once more. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"They're soulmates, tell me you didn't feel it. The way he knew he was coming.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I did, Mela.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter all these years, she finally had everything. Her family was whole once more(Menoiteus and her father could rot in the very pits of Tartarus for all she cared) and they had welcomed a new addition. She had never wished for power or riches but this. A woman could never wish for more than dutifully keeping house and raising her children. A sentiment she had heard throughout her life. Sure she had a few missteps in her life, but she in her own way had broken the mold. \n\n\n \n\n\nHappiness.\n\n\n ", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"24350869\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"battle\", \"Victim\": \"Patroclus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"battle\", \"Victim\": \"Patroclus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 24160720, "full_story": "When Cassandra is making her decision, she sees all of the possible futures. She hears what people will say about her. Opportunist. Whore who couldn't keep her word. Liar. Wicked. Ambitious. Bitch who doesn't know her place. Cunning. Cold. Proud. Selfish. Witch without a piece of a women in herself with a cursing touch. An amazon who wouldn't be broken under the severe pressure. Cassandra heard all of that when she made her decision.\n\nThere is some truth on all of the rumours - it was ambitious and maybe even a little bit selfish to ask for such a gift a man she already desired so much. But is it really so bad to want more from live? To want more than a handsome husband and twenty children? To want to see the world? To experience something? To be unique?\n\nAnd besides she was convinced that Apollo will leave her someday. Sooner or later she will have to live without the godly tinsel. Was it so bad to want to keep at least a little piece of him? Would someone object if everything turned out differently?\n\nBut this was never a possibility in the future, so Cassandra could never be sure.\n\nHow a prophetic gift was filling her pieces of future started to fly through her head. Golden in the beginning how everything was illuminated by Apollo and happiness and their shared love. She saw them making love and it was just a glimpse, but she was overwhelmed anyway. And then she saw him, their perfect son, living image of Apollo aside from his dark curls which were all hers. And she loved him, she loved him so much, because to her he was already alive.\n\nAnd then everything darkened because Paris came to them and her father was resolved that he could fight the destiny. He trusted her and Helenus that Paris means danger, but his heart was too soft, and he couldn't do what needed to be done and accepted him to the family instead. And this Cassandra was a mother and contemplated escaping while it was still possible, but in the end... she couldn't desert her family. Still hoping that something could be done. And the war is coming. And the war is here. And her son is growing so quickly, because these dark times aren't fit for children and heroes are growing up quickly when it is needed.\n\nAnd he is just five, but he looks like fourteen years old. And she is pregnant again and all she sees is a darkness and death. Her brothers dying like flies and she knows that they don't return when they are marching to their last battles. There is nothing she could do, and she is going insane. And her little girl is born, all Apollo with his glowing golden curls except for nose which is all her own. And she is hardly baby at all, after a week she looks like a one year old, after a month she looks like three-year-old and after a year she is a fourteen years old maiden.\n\nHer son who looks like an adult now is fighting for Troy and she is dying with fear even though she knows he have his father's protection. And her fear was justified because one piece of a future later, she is holding her dead son in her arms. He is just seven years old, even though he is taller than her. And she is blind with a grief and everybody is celebrating ending of a war, but she still knows this isn't it. She is trying to tell them, but they thought her insane with grief and she just don't have a strength to argue with them and she is pregnant again and she knows that her end is near and Apollo is gone, mourning on his own and she needs him so much right now.\n\nAnd then the city is flooded by them and she knew this will happen and managed to escape to temple of Athena with her daughter. She known they would never desecrate temple of Athena, she was their goddess, their sponsor. She thought they are at least a little safe there, but then the future started shifting and Cassandra was terrified. They were trapped here. They were trapped here, and Achaeans were barbarians. Ajax the Lesser entered the temple and Cassandra tried to shield her daughter with her body. All their fight was for naught. He raped her daughter right there on Athena's altar, made her watch the whole act. And when her turn came, she was so numb with pain and grief she wasn't even fighting. She was looking into Athena's eyes instead asking her to make him pay for it. She lost her unborn child right there on the floor of the temple and the only thing that was holding her alive was her daughter. She lives and Cassandra must take care of her.\n\nIn that moment Cassandra was done. All she wanted was to stop these images and feelings which flooded her head and body, but she couldn't stop it. She couldn't stop it and she must see it to the grim end.\n\nThey aren't capable to punish Ajax, but Cassandra knows Athena will punish them all for that and it lessens the pain a little. They divide the women among themselves like livestock and she couldn't be even sicker anymore. Diomedes claims her daughter and Cassandra is horrified because she is glad it is him; he could keep her daughter alive; he is sensible, and she sees his safe sale home. She is horrified because she is glad for her daughter's slavery. King Agamemnon claims her, and she sees her own death then and everything skips forward.\n\nShe is staying in front of the Mycenae gates, her daughter is dead then, one of the casualties of travelling. And she sees her own death, waiting behind the gate, and all that will follow. And at this point she thought that the fate couldn't surprise her, but then she sees the world burning, the sun crushing to the ground, Apollo raging, monsters plundering and plague spreading. She sees Apollo blaming Zeus for everything but knowing he can't defeat the most powerful god of all. But destroying is so much easier that winning and Apollo doesn't care about anything right now. And she sees it, she sees the end of the world, she sees his death, she sees everybody's death. And that's the end of it.\n\nCassandra sees all of it when she makes her decision. And she isn't sure if anything can be prevented, but she knows she must change things and it hurts so much, because she knows what she is giving up. She loves him now; she loves their children. Maybe deserting Troy would be enough, but she knows she couldn't risk it and then there is only one option left. She hurts him. She hurts him so badly he would never forgive her. And he curses her in return and there is no turning back now.\n\n \n\n \n\nApollo watches her standing in front Mycenae gate. He watches her die. He thought it would be freeing, maybe even satisfactory. Instead he feels sad and hollow. There is still withered flower of his love deep in his heard. His anger cooled down at last and he doesn't understand her any better now. He still can't understand what happened then. The truth died with her and he is prepared to let it go, but before that he'll make sure that she will be avenged.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"24160720\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"battle\", \"Victim\": \"Cassandra's son\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"miscarriage\", \"Victim\": \"unborn child\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Ajax the Lesser\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"travel\", \"Victim\": \"Cassandra's daughter\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_4\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"execution\", \"Victim\": \"Cassandra\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unspecified\"}, \"death_event_5\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"destruction\", \"Victim\": \"all\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Apollo\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 17006691, "full_story": "The Trojans call him son of Priam, but Achilles knows better than that. \n\nThe fact is, divinity knows divinity; what is divine within Achilles recognises it in any others of the same persuasion that he might meet. He knew it in Heracles, once upon a time at Chiron's table, and he knows it in Sarpedon of Lycia, who is set to fight against Greece with the Trojans. He knows it in the youth standing before him, too. What the Achaeans whisper about him is true: Troilus is Hecuba's, yes, but not by the king of Troy. He is Apollo's son. Achilles can feel it. \n\nOf course, where Apollo's children are concerned, that moment of instinctive, bodily recognition is not something he requires. Children of Zeus feel powerful, as if lit up from within with a spark of their father's lightning bolt. Children of Ares feel strong, as if filled up with their father's thirst for war. Children of Apollo, on the other hand, are almost uniformly radiant; they are beautiful, which necessitates no special skill in its perception. But it is, perhaps, because Achilles can both see and feel Apollo's radiance within Troilus, Prince of Troy, that desire cuts him as keenly as it does. \n\nOutside, by the fountain, he reached up one hand and tore Troilus down from the back of his horse. Troilus fled into the nearby temple, a distraction so that his sister might escape, and despite his knowing this, Achilles followed him inside. Perhaps one day he will concern himself with Polyxena but she is entirely earthly and, as such, she does not tempt him as her brother does. Neither is she the reason he has come. She is not the reason he was sent.\n\nThey stand now at the darkened altar in the braziers' hot, unsteady light. There could be no escape but through him, and though Troilus is not small, and Troilus does not cower, he is not Achilles's match. \n\n\"You know who I am,\" says Troilus. \n\n\"Yes,\" replies Achilles, though he understands the words were not a question to be answered. \n\n\"You know who I am within myself. As Helen does.\"\n\nAchilles met Helen once, not so very long ago. Beautiful Helen, prized Helen, pretext for Agamemnon's fucking war that Achilles is not sure he wants to play a part in. She is a daughter of Zeus and he knew it in the very first instant that they stepped into each other's presence; her sister is a daughter of Tyndareus, and he knew that in a much more mundane way. After all, Castor and Clytemnestra are to their twins what night is to day: paler, and colder, and wanting for dawn's divine light. \n\n\"Yes,\" Achilles says. \"I know that.\" \n\n\"You mean to kill me.\" \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\n\"In this place?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" \n\n\"But you know who...\"\n\nAchilles raises his brows and quickly, Troilus understands. Achilles can see the realisation of it in the expression settling on his face and in the stiffening in his body. \n\n\"You mean to kill me because you know,\" says Troilus.\n\nAchilles nods curtly. He has yet to draw his sword, but he will do so, inevitably, inexorably, and Troilus clearly knows this. Troilus does not say my father will be angry, because it is clear Achilles knows this. He does not say please spare me, because he knows Achilles won't. As he draws himself up tall and taut and very brave, what he says is, \"Do it quickly,\" but Achilles cannot promise this. He would like to say he wishes that he could, but that would be a lie. He is many things, but he is not a liar. \n\nWhat is divine within Achilles recognises what is divine in Troilus, and he wonders. He wants to know how Troilus's skin might taste against his lips, drenched as it has been by Trojan sun. He wants to know how his blood might taste against his tongue, infused as it is with Apollo's light. He grits his teeth. He clenches his jaw. He clutches tight at the hilt of his sword that hangs there ready at his waist. Achilles is not known for his steadiness, for his moderation, or his control. He does not expect to keep any of these things for long. \n\n\"Will you do what I tell you to?\" Achilles asks. It sounds much like a response Troilus's request for his celerity, as if a prerequisite for Achilles's compliance, and though it's not he does not clarify. He tells himself that's not a kind of lie within itself. \n\n\"What do you want?\" Troilus asks. He sounds careful. He sounds wary, for which Achilles cannot blame him.\n\n\"Take off your clothes, prince,\" Achilles replies. He sees no reason to elaborate. It gets the point across.\n\nTroilus understands. He does not look pleased, but he understands, and after a moment's quiet consideration - Achilles could not call it hesitation as it seems to him to be quite measured and deliberate - he unties the belt from about his waist and drops it to the temple floor. His short chiton hangs more loosely then against his skin, still creased above his hips where his belt cinched it in, and he reaches deft fingers to the pins that hold it at his shoulders. He drops the pins, too, deliberately, with a clatter of gold on stone, then he lets the tunic fall. He is naked beneath and in his veins, Achilles's blood burns with all the fire into which his mother dipped him. He thinks sometimes he took in the flames just as much as he did the ambrosia.\n\nHis skin bared in the firelight there in the temple of Apollo Thymbraios, at the altar by the feet of his divine father's towering statue, Troilus could almost be a god himself. He is as exquisite in his composition as if he were a statue hewn from living flesh in place of marble, from his elegant neck to his muscled arms, from the bow of his lips to the thick length of his manhood. He is radiant perfection. And, in that moment, Achilles finds that he both adores him and despises him. He is not sure which it is takes precedence.\n\nHe steps forward. He takes Troilus's bare shoulders in his hands and feels him flinch at his touch, but that does not deter him. He runs his palms and his fingertips down Troilus's long arms. His fingers encircle Troilus's wrists. His grip tightens.\n\nThe Trojan prince is perhaps just half Achilles's age, a beautiful ephebe not yet twenty years old, and Achilles is no great giant of a man, not like Ajax who seems to dwarf both the Trojan and Achaean armies to a man, so it should be no surprise that they stand eye to eye, equal in at least that one way. That small parity makes it all the easier for Achilles to press his mouth to Troilus's. It makes it all the easier for him to slip the fingers of one hand into Troilus's curling hair and kiss him, softly, as if he does so for no other reason but affection. And Troilus, perhaps because he thinks that it will spare his life, perhaps because he believes in what Achilles has allowed him to misapprehend of their situation, lifts his one free hand to rest cautiously at Achilles's waist. He returns the kiss. Achilles is unsure if he wishes him to pretend he's willing or if that ruins it entirely. \n\nHe knows what the gods would do, were they in his place. He knows what Zeus would do; Achilles is not the son of Zeus, but he might have been. Zeus wanted Achilles's mother, but the prophecy said that any son of Thetis would be greater than his father and so he left the having of her to Peleus. Achilles might have been born a god, but he was not. He was born mortal, just as so many are, but he is different because of what his mother did to him. Achilles is the man he is because he's not a man the way that others are. Almost all of that was burned away. \n\nBut, here and now, it seems he is his father's son: Peleus wanted Thetis, so he took her, very much against her will though very much with Zeus's; Achilles wants Troilus, so he takes him, too. \n\nHe extricates himself from Troilus's embrace and he takes off what he's wearing. He was sent to Thymbra to kill a prince and so accordingly he wore his armour; Troilus watches as he removes his breastplate and vambraces, then his greaves. He removes the tunic underneath, removes his sandals and steps barefoot onto the cold stone floor. Troilus watches as he strokes himself to hardness. Troilus, whether bravely or naively, does the same in front of him. \n\nHe bends him over the altar, dashing flowers and cups and bowls of offerings this way and that to make the space they need. He presses Troilus down with one palm firm between his shoulder blades. One of the bowls he's spilled was filled with olive oil and so he dips his fingers into what remains of it, then rubs them between Troilus's cheeks, against the hole he finds there. \n\n\"Are you a virgin, prince?\" he asks, his voice almost a rasp as his fingertips tease. \"Has any other man had you?\"\n\nTroilus shakes his head, which is his answer. His fingers grip the altar. Achilles believes that's the truth of it; he'll be the first man and the last that Troilus ever knows. \n\nHe slicks himself with the same part-spilled oil, from base to tip, till he's dripping with it, and Troilus turns his head and cranes his neck to look as if he cannot help but do so. Because he knows that Troilus's eyes are on him, he strokes himself slowly. Because he knows Troilus is watching, he lifts his cock just a little so that he can see the oil drip down over his balls and catch against his thighs, the whole arrangement glistening in the firelight. Troilus blushes but he does not turn away, not until Achilles's hands move from himself and back to him instead. He parts Troilus's cheeks with both his palms. He directs the tip of his phallus to slip between them, the slick length of him rubbing over his hole. \n\nWhen he pushes inside him, Troilus moans and grips more tightly at Apollo's altar till his fingers are almost uniformly white. His body is hot, a tight sheath for Achilles's cock as he seats himself inside him right down to the base. When Achilles moves in him, gripping at his hips with hands slippery with oil, Troilus pushes back against him though he curses softly against the stone. \n\n\"You were made for this moment, Prince of Troy,\" Achilles says, with a catch in his voice as he flexes his hips to fuck him. He rakes his blunt nails over Troilus's perfect back, either side of his spine, raising livid red stripes in their wake. He rubs the first two fingers of his right hand between Troilus's cheeks, one either side of his own throbbing erection, to trace the rim of his tight hole. \"Don't you think Apollo made you for the length of my cock? Don't you think you fit me well?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" Troilus replies, with one cheek pressed tight against the altar. \"Yes,\" Troilus sobs, with one hand wrapped around his own erection. He comes with a gasp and a strangled sound that's almost as if Achilles had wrapped his hands around his throat, and he spends himself against the polished stone of Apollo's altar. Achilles believes he believes it, at least right here and now. \n\nThe sum of Troilus's existence is, within that moment, length and girth of Achilles's cock inside him, and so he pulls out of him abruptly. He pushes him down to his knees on the floor there at Apollo's feet and he follows him down to his own knees, then pushes in again before he can shudder for the lack of him. He comes inside him moments later, teeth gritted, groaning, looking up into Apollo's stony face. A kind of warm triumph floods his veins and he wraps his arms around Troilus's slim waist. He kisses the crook of Troilus's long neck. Kneeling there, softening though still pushed deep inside him, Troilus's bare back rests against Achilles's broad chest. They breathe almost in unison. \n\nAchilles would like to take Troilus with him when he leaves the temple. He would bind his wrists and lash him to his chariot if that proved necessary, but he does not think it would; he believes Troilus would go with him of his own accord and lie with him in his tent on the beach where the Achaeans have made camp. Perhaps they would bathe together in the sea and later, once Apollo's Trojan sun had dried them, Achilles might lick the salt away from Troilus's tanned skin. He imagines pressing his mouth to Troilus's wrists, to his hips, to his temples by his dampened hairline, or the creases where his thighs merge with his body. He imagines the taste of his skin, of his cock, of his come, and sighs against his neck. \n\nAchilles would like to take him with him when he leaves, but he knows he can't. The prophecy says if Troilus dies before he's twenty, the Achaeans will succeed. Troilus was made for two things, and only two: for Achilles's cock, and for the fall of Troy. Achilles knows neither of them will live to see the latter because for all that is divine in them, for all his mother's burnings and anointings, they both remain mortal. Fuck the gods, he thinks, that gave them this strange life placed halfway between the two. Fuck Apollo, who gave the world this boy that Achilles has to take from it. \n\nHe pulls back. He pulls out. He stands. They both shiver. \n\nHe draws his sword and puts the tip to the base of Troilus's perfect neck; Troilus bows his head almost as if he understands that this must happen, because the gods have willed it even if the two of them do not. Achilles washes Apollo's marble feet with the blood of his beautiful son and he leaves the body there before him. It's not the kind of sacrifice a god expects, but in the end, he does at least make it quick.\n\nThis will not be the only death before the war is done, and will not be the only one at Achilles's hands, but it's one he will remember. \n\nAnd then, when it's done, he simply walks away.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"17006691\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"sword\", \"Victim\": \"Troilus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Achilles\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 1087311, "full_story": "She never really considered herself beautiful. Even as she stared at her reflection in the pond outside her home, Medusa didn't see what her mother kept bragging about. She wasn't ugly, that could be plainly seen, but she wasn't the most stunning woman ever created. Her blond hair was softer than most and her skin was a soft peach color that was smooth to the touch. Many a man had asked for her hand, but she turned them down one by one, knowing that it was her beauty she was to be married for and nothing more.\n\nHer mother would sometimes, in hushed tones, praise her by saying that she rivaled the beauty of the nymphs and even Aphrodite herself. In response, Medusa would blush, say nothing, but would then go to the temple of Aphrodite and pray that the goddess would restrain her wrath for the day. Every night, she would return and pray again, thanking the goddess for not striking down her mother. Many people had seen Medusa enter the temple alone and believed that she was praying the Aphrodite to enhance her beauty. They were nothing but rumors, but many of the common folk ended up believing them.\n\nToday, though, Medusa was visiting another goddess; Athena, Goddess of Wisdom. Medusa's mother had bid her to take the offerings to the temple and thank the goddess for blessing them. The best of her father's crops were divided among sacrifices for Athena and Demeter and while her mother prayed to Demeter for the harvest, Medusa prayed to Athena.\n\nMedusa bowed deeply to the idol of Athena, laying down her family's sacrifice for the month; the finest wheat her father had harvested, the first batch of milk the family goat had made, the first figs harvested. The gifts were simple, yet Medusa knew that they pleased the goddess. Making sure that the gifts were arranged perfectly at the foot of the statue, she called out to one of the priestesses to let her know that her family made a sacrifice.\n\n\"May Athena's blessings come to you,\" the priestess replied.\n\nMedusa bowed again and prostrated herself before the idol, praying for Athena's blessing on her family in the days ahead.\n\n\"Why dost thou bow?\" a deep voice said from behind her, \"Thou art matched with the beauty of this goddess.\"\n\nMedusa got up from her position and turned to face the one who spoke.\n\nThe man standing behind her was attractive, to say the least. He was tall and broad shouldered, a small beard adorning his angular face. His deep blue eyes were looking her over as though she was something to be devoured.\n\n\"I would not be so vain as to compare myself to the gods,\" she replied.\n\n\"But what if I was a god?\" the man asked, stepping closer to her, \"What if I truly believed that thou hast a beauty to rival that of Athena herself?\"\n\nMedusa shuffled back. \"I would think that you were foolish and should not speak of such things in a goddess's temple.\"\n\n\"Then let me discuss it another way with thy beautiful form.\" The man moved forward and pulled himself onto Medusa's body. Her eyes widened and she began to scream as the world faded around her, leaving just herself and the man.\n\nMedusa's knew nothing but water. Deep blue filled her vision as waves lapped at her exposed flesh. She writhed as the waves rocked her and screamed again, not caring if the water surrounding her filled her lungs and drowned her. That would be a just punishment for what she was doing.\n\nAs suddenly as it happened, it was done. Medusa opened her eyes, the man nowhere in sight.\n\n\"Thy punishment is decided,\" a loud voice echoed through the temple, \"Thy once beloved beauty is gone. All who look upon thee now shall be so disgusted that they shall turn to stone.\"\n\nThen, the voice was gone and Medusa found herself alone next to the idol, bruised and afraid.\n\n\"Lady Medusa, are you alright?\" the soft voice of a priestess called out, \"The goddess has inflicted her wrath upon someone in the temple and I-\"\n\nMedusa raised her head and the priestess stopped speaking. The other woman's mouth opened into a large 'O' and she stepped backwards, her eyes wide in fear. Medusa scowled and a soft hissing noise filled her ears.\n\nThe priestess stopped her backwards retreat, her feet seemingly rooted to the ground. There was a soft clicking as the silk slippers she wore seemed to harden and turn a soft shade of grey. Then, her ankles began the strange transformation, then her calves and her thighs. Medusa saw the girl struggle, but she noticed how the priestess's eyes remained on her at all times. The priestess's whole body turned grey and Medusa watched as one of the priestess's veins pulsed slowly through its alabaster prison. She watched with her own horror as it slowed to a stop, the priestess now a sister to the idol standing next to her.\n\nMedusa wanted to cry, wanted to scream, but she couldn't bring herself to. The power she had felt ending the priestess's life was...intoxicating. She absentmindedly licked her lips, a small part of her mind wondering if this was to be part of her punishment.\n\n_____________________\n\nThe man looked no different from the others; same weapons, same arrogant nature about him, the same intent to kill her. Medusa had killed hundreds of men with a single glance; this newcomer was nothing but another nameless body to be added to the list of deceased. No one who met her gaze ever breathed again.\n\nMedusa couldn't help the feral grin that graced her lips. That's why she had been placed on this cursed spit of rock with her 'sisters', the Gorgans. Her gaze had ended many a life on the mainland and, Posiden, the god whose actions had caused this curse to come upon her, had ferried her away to the Island of the Gorgans so that she would not harm another mortal.\n\nYet, every man that set foot on the island was added to her collection of statues. She had hundreds hoarded in her own little corner of the island. Every day, she would gaze at the statues, caressing their faces and kissing their frozen lips, wondering if this would be as close as she would ever get to truly kissing a man. Posiden's rape was still etched into her body as though her own had been made of stone that day, but she wanted a true love instead of a god's affection. Even the pleasure of turning men into stone was beginning to bore her.\n\nThe man that was approaching her now was still no different than all the others. He was young; too young to be out hunting dangerous things like her. His eyes were bright with youth, but Medusa could see age beginning to find its way into his strong face. Unlike the other men, she noted, he moved slowly, holding up a golden shield instead of a sword. He was moving the shield around him, scrutinizing it with determination.\n\n\"You're a smart one,\" she said aloud, making the young man stop in his tracks, \"Using a mirror to figure out my location. I must say that I am impressed.\"\n\nThe man closed his eyes as she finished speaking, raising the shield so that it was angled away from his body.\n\nMedusa licked her lips. Yes, this was turning out to be very interesting.\n\n\"What are you called, boy?\" she asked, moving closer to him. She relished the feeling of power as the man's body tensed.\n\n\"Perseus,\" he replied. Medusa reached out and caressed his cheek, loving the feel of warm flesh against her fingers. She could feel Perseus's pulse increase as her finger lingered.\n\n\"And why have you come?\" she whispered, \"It must have something to do with me. Everyone who steps foot on this island wants to kill me for one reason or another.\"\n\nPerseus bit his lip, almost debating whether or not he should reveal his quest to the thing that could end his life as soon as he let his guard down. He let his lip go, resolve urging him on. \"I have come for the head of the ugly Medusa to kill the man who is going to marry my mother.\"\n\nMedusa snatched her hand away. \"'Ugly?'\", she repeated, \"There is nothing ugly about me. Years ago, I was adored by many, most of them saying that my beauty rivaled the gods. Athena's curse couldn't have affect that much...\" Looking back on the years she spent before she was sentenced to life on the island, she had never thought of looking in a reflective surface. She stayed as far away from water as she could, ever afraid that Posiden would come for her again.\n\nPerseus hesitated. \"You don't know?\" he asked, his eyes still screwed shut. His arm moved slowly, bringing the shield he held closer to her. Its surface glinted in the dim light and Medusa came face to face with her reflection.\n\nMedusa stared at herself in horror as she gazed at her reflection. The form of her body hadn't changed much, but she noticed several changes to the contents of her once desired body. Her smooth skin was cracked and looked almost scaly in some places. Her now snake-like eyes widened as she stared at her face, old age and the spell taking its toll in the form of craggy wrinkles and sagging flesh. Medusa almost cried out in shock when she saw that her beautiful golden hair was now a pile of snakes attached to her scalp. They hissed in distress as she reached for them, wanting to tear them out of her and throw them in the dust. They coiled themselves gently around her wrists, their hisses turned soothing as they rubbed their ugly heads against her skin, trying to soothe her.\n\n\"I never realized...\" she murmured, the horror gone from her face, but her serpent eyes still gazed at her reflection. \"I guess I am no longer beautiful now.\"\n\nAnd then she heard the sound of steel slicing through flesh and she saw the sky for a moment before everything went black.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"1087311\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"petrification\", \"Victim\": \"unnamed man\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Medusa\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"decapitation\", \"Victim\": \"Medusa\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Perseus\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 734141, "full_story": "The first time he puts his hands on me, I see her. Just for a flash, a second long scene. She stands over him, a sword in her hand. I taste the metallic tang of blood in my mouth, just for a moment. Since the sack of Troy I have drifted through days, a victim of a catastrophe too vast to stop. I tried to warn my people, but my words were not heeded, my visions not believed. All the death and violence came crashing over us in a flood that could not be halted. Since that night I have wandered like a ghost in the Greek camp, a shade in the body of a girl. My skin is cold and clammy to the touch. The men put their hands on me and I feel nothing, my mind drifting loose, like oil upon the surface of water.\n\n And then Agamemnon, leader of the Greeks, claims me for his captive. As his hands come down on my shoulders I see this, this image of his doom. For the first time in many days I feel something leap inside of me. I see the conqueror of my city brought low by his own wife. I laugh aloud. He looks at me, incredulous, perhaps wondering if I am really as mad as they say, but my laughter does not stop him. I do not laugh again. Later, when he leaves to confer with the other Greek leaders, I turn the vision over in my mind. The fierce joy flares in me again, and I am glad to know Agamemnon will not go unpunished. She must be a singular woman, his queen. The first few days I longed to join my father in death, but this vision, this woman, causes hope to kindle within me. I will see him dead.\n\n We sail across the Aegean, lashed by winds and terrible storms. When we pass by the coastline of his country, a beacon flares into life. His ships sail into the harbour, and he leaves his soldiers camped down in the city. The sun is sinking below the horizon, staining the sky crimson and gold. He takes me in his chariot, and we mount the hill to his palace. As we reach the top I see another beacon burning. Our arrival is expected.\n\n We approach the palace. In the gathering dark I see her standing there. Clytaemnestra. She is a single figure, lit by two lines of torches. Her arms are bare, encircled by bands of gold. Her skin is golden too, thick muscles beneath its surface. Around her neck a torque of gold glistens. Gold stitching upon her dress outlines the powerful lines of her body. The torches burn bright in the darkness, and she blazes too. They outline a path up to the palace steps where she is standing. The light shines upon her jewellery, on her skin, and she seems to shimmer before us like one of my visions. As the chariot stops beside the path of torches she steps to the left and claps her hands. The palace doors are thrown open behind her. Servants come out, bearing a long red tapestry. They unroll it, throwing it down the steps. It unfurls dark as blood, a red tide flowing out between the lines of torches. I gasp. In my mind I see the steps of the palace in Troy flow with blood, real blood, liquid and sticky. It smelled of rot and the grave and the sea.\n\n Clytaemnestra strides forward, beside the tapestry, not upon it. Her long tawny hair falls wild and loose down her back, like the mane of a lion. I have never seen a lion in the wild, but my father had one brought to the palace once. It prowled in its cage, movements constrained by the bars. She reminds me of its captive grace, and the sense I had that were the bars removed it would explode into violence. She comes to stand before us, at the foot of the pathway she has created. Agamemnon steps down from the chariot and she smiles, showing her teeth.\n\n They speak, and at her urging he strides forward upon the tapestries, his feet treading upon the thick red path. In my memory, he and his men stalk forward as Troy burns, their sandals soaking up blood. He goes through the doors alone, and Clytaemnestra turns to me.\n\n 'Come princess, there is no need to remain in the chariot. Come into the palace, my women will see you bathed and dressed.' Her smile does not touch her eyes. I say nothing, thinking of the lion again, and her teeth. She raises her eyebrows. 'My husband is very taken with you, little bird. Perhaps he is in love. You do not have to speak to me, if you do not wish, but come inside.'\n\n I find my voice. 'Why do you call me that?'\n\n She laughs. 'You are so dark and still, you make me think of the nightingales in my gardens at dusk. And I have heard tales of your visions, your songs.'\n\n I do not speak again, but allow her women to lead me from the chariot and into the palace. I do not trust her kind words. She spoke as sweetly to her husband, and I know the malice which must fester in her heart toward him.\n\n There are low fires lit within the whole palace, so that the marble floors shine with light, and flickering shadows crowd in the corners. I am led to a bath chamber, a bronze tub brimming with water, rose petals floating on its surface. Steam clouds the air. The servants take my clothes and do not return them. I sink into the water and let out a sigh. It is soothing upon my skin, which seems to soften beneath its surface. I smell sweet now, like flower sap. I look up and find Clytaemnestra standing there, watching me. I cannot read her expression. Her brow furrows.\n\n 'How came you by that?' she asks, indicating a bruise the size of a palm upon my breast. I look down, and remember.\n\n I speak without thinking. 'That, that is the love token your husband left upon me.' I am surprised by the venom in my voice. So, it seems, is she. Her lips part, as if she would speak, but a servant comes in.\n\n 'Milady, the King wishes her brought to him.'\n\n Clytaemnestra nods. 'Of course.'\n\n I am given a white dress to wear. It is cool upon my skin, still hot from the bath. We walk through the palace. Water clings to my hair, weighing it down. The girl takes me to a bedroom, and then leaves. He is standing there waiting, and smiles to see me. My pulse flutters beneath my breast. I thought I had forgotten how to feel, my emotions dying with my father at Troy, but being in this house has awoken them again. He walks toward me and I feel a sick dread. Maybe I am not the dead girl I thought. The naked want in his eyes is obscene. He props his sword against the bed and comes closer, close enough that I can see the individual hairs in his finely trimmed beard, like little spikes. Do not touch me, I think. I do not want your hands on me again. I do not, cannot, speak, but let him manoeuvre me, backing me toward the bed. His teeth shine in the torchlight as he smiles. My newly awoken fear has aroused him. I feel nausea swoop in my stomach and find myself longing for the numbness I had felt in my shock. He looks at me and sees my city burning. I am a trophy to him, a marker of his victory. I think again of Clytaemnestra. She will avenge my city and me, whether she knows it or not. It is as if this summons her. I look over his shoulder and see her behind, stalking forward on quiet feet, her sword raised. My eyes meet hers for a second. She raises an eyebrow. I look back at him, seeking to keep his attention fixed on me. She moves closer.\n\n 'Agamemnon,' she says, her voice low. 'This is for our daughter.' He turns at her voice, his hand going to his hip as he registers her words, but of course his sword is not there. Her blade plunges into his stomach and out, dark blood spurting forth, spattering her dress. Her smile is so wide it is a grimace, a snarl. He falls sideways onto the floor, crying out wordlessly in pain and surprise. His head hits the ground but he is still moving. One hand goes to his waist, coming up red. The other gropes behind him, reaching for his sword. I am faster. I snatch it up and unsheathe it, the scabbard clattering on the floor.\n\n 'This is for my people,' I say, and I stab down into his flesh, a hand span higher than the wound she has given him. It goes in deep. I am stronger than I thought. He coughs, red foam gathering on his lips. I leave the sword in him and step back, looking down. Impaled, helpless, he shudders and jerks, pinned by his own sword. He tries to speak, but only spits blood onto the floor. She kneels beside him, gripping his head with her hand.\n\n 'For Iphigenia,' she says, her lips near his, and she presses her sword down and across, slitting his throat. His lifeblood gushes forth, splashing into her smiling mouth, streaking her skin, dark flecks landing on her like red petals. She stands and looks at me.\n\n 'So,' she says. 'Why did you help me?' If I thought my heart beat fast before, it is nothing to now. It throbs in my temples, my throat, hummingbird fast. I meet her eyes. She is still smiling, fierce and wide. Awed, I incline my head toward her. Blood drips from her sword onto the floor, joining the spreading pool there. She stands like a statue, terrible and still. I look up at her again, unable to keep my eyes from her.\n\n 'You are not the only one he has hurt,' I say.\n\n 'I did not do this for you,' she says after a pause.\n\n I laugh. 'No, and yet it is done nonetheless. We gave him a quicker death than he deserved.'\n\n 'Is that so, little nightingale?' she says. The blood, his blood, still glistens upon her lips in the torchlight. She steps around him, closer to me. 'You are even more vicious than I thought.'\n\n 'Maybe so. Will you kill me as well?' I ask, raising my chin. I know the answer, but I want to hear her say it, to make her admit it. I can almost taste the blood in my mouth.\n\n 'No,' she says quietly, very close to me now. 'You helped me,' she says. 'I will not forget.' I can see her chest rise and fall in her excitement, a vein throbbing in her throat. I cannot help myself; I reach out for her, and kiss her. The sword is still in her hand, but the other comes up, stroking my wet hair. I fall against her, clinging to her. She tastes of the death she has wrought, salt blood upon her lips. She drops the sword, but I do not hear it hit the floor, a roaring in my ears. We fall back upon the bed. Her weight presses me down, her touch upon my skin blotting out everything. I feel more than I have in days, a tide of sensation, my pulse beating like drums inside of me. I am giddy with triumph. I kiss the trail of blood from her neck, her throat, her cheek. It is like ambrosia upon my lips, the taste of victory and vengeance.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"734141\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"stabbing\", \"Victim\": \"Agamemnon\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Clytemnestra\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"stabbing\", \"Victim\": \"Agamemnon\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Narrator\"}} ```"}
{"work_id": 660704, "full_story": "Brauron belongs to the Arktoi and Artemis does what she must to keep it that way. The bars are hers and the strip joints are hers and the sheriff is in her pocket. Every other club that wants to run product up or down the coast has to pass through her town and they pay for the privilege. If they think that the only all-female motorcycle club for seven states is going to be a pushover, they are quickly proved wrong. The desert has a wide embrace to welcome the dead.\n\nThere is a woman in Artemis' bed and she does what she must to keep her there. Kallisto is bright and golden; she smells of gasoline and warm asphalt and everything Artemis loves. Artemis leaves epic poems of her devotion with her teeth on Kallisto's thighs, presses her desire inside on the tip of her tongue. Kallisto sobs and begs, hips rolling, but Artemis doesn't let go. Her love is greedy; Kallisto knew that before she ever kissed her, quick and chaste behind the garage in the fall when the weather was turning. Now it is summer and the sweat stands out on her lover's skin. Artemis laps it from the hollow of her throat, fingers slick and curling.\n\nHer life is everything she wanted when she left her father's house.\n\nShe's afraid it won't last.\n\n \n\nThe trouble starts small. Her father's Olympians are scaring patrons out of Arktoi bars, harassing the staff, driving club profits down. It's petty, no less than she expected from her father but so much milder than she dreamed. It still needs to be dealt with. She still doesn't want to.\n\n\"I'll go for you,\" Kallisto says one morning over breakfast.\n\nArtemis' head jerks up. \"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Of course. If he's half the asshole you've said he is, you don't need to be anywhere near him.\" Kallisto dishes scrambled eggs onto their plates. \"I'm your second; I can speak for you. I'll get it sorted out and be back by dinner.\"\n\nShe isn't back by dinner.\n\n \n\nArtemis finds her in the kitchen the next morning, clutching a cup of coffee, eyes bloodshot. Before Artemis can ask what happened, Kallisto walks out.\n\nThey play a game of avoidance for weeks. Kallisto shows up to club meetings and her shifts at the garage, but she won't sleep in Artemis' bed, won't even meet her eyes.\n\nArtemis corners her eventually in the hall bathroom, hunched over the toilet. Kallisto is only dry heaving, nerves and not illness; the source is obvious--a pregnancy test lies forgotten in the sink. Artemis doesn't bother to count the blue lines; her sinking feeling drops all the way through the floor.\n\n\"Who was it?\" (She knows already and hates that she knows.) \"Who?\" she howls and Kallisto flinches.\n\nKallisto drags the back of her hand over her mouth, scrubbing away bile. \"It was your father.\"\n\n \n\nKallisto tells her what happened in fits and starts. Artemis sits beside her on the bathroom floor, close but not touching, and listens. It's a familiar story.\n\n(Artemis remembers Leda, one of the Olympians' women. She got along with everybody, always had a smile and a kind word. Once, after a patching over, she'd been making eyes at a new guy all night. It had been enough to set off Zeus's temper.\n\nShe remembers watching Zeus throw Leda down on a pool table and fuck her right there in front of everyone; the wings of her swan tattoo flexing along her shoulder blades as she tried to crawl away.\n\nArtemis had been twelve.)\n\nEventually, carefully, they move back into Artemis' room. She spoons up behind Kallisto on the bed, slides one hand around to rest on her stomach.\n\nThis could be her child. The only child she may ever have.\n\n\"It's gonna be alright,\" Artemis says. \"We'll make it alright.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Kallisto breathes back. \"We will.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis is wrist-deep in an engine rebuild when her phone rings. She wipes her hands off, digs her phone out from her pocket. \"What.\"\n\n\"Art.\" It's her brother. He's the only one who ever got away with calling her that. (He stayed behind and most days she doesn't blame him. It's not like Daddy was trying to watch him in the shower.)\n\n\"Your girl's been here for the last two hours. She's in Dad's office; sounds like they're just talking, but--\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Sometimes talking is dangerous enough. \"Thanks, Apollo. I appreciate it.\"\n\n\"Of course, sweetheart. Stay safe, okay?\"\n\nShe hangs up so she won't have to lie to him.\n\n \n\nThe following night, Artemis and Kallisto go for a ride. \n\n(It's something they did more often when the club was young: take just one bike and a blanket and drive out into the desert well past dark. They'd watch the stars and make out like teenagers until it got too cold to stand.)\n\nKallisto wanders in a slow circle after they park, talking about her doctor's appointment and the girls she met in the waiting room. Artemis drops the kickstand, draws her gun from the saddlebag.\n\n\"Get on your knees, honey.\" \n\nKallisto glances back, a smile already starting to form. She thinks Artemis is flirting right up until she spots the gun. The blood drains from her face. \"Artemis, please--\"\n\n\"Turn the fuck around and get down on your knees.\"\n\nShe does, slowly, shakily, hands raised. \"Baby, you've got to understand--\"\n\nArtemis doesn't want to hear it. \"I understand perfectly. You sold me out.\"\n\n\"No, no, that's not true.\" Kallisto risks a peek over her shoulder; her pupils are blown in fear. \"I...I made a deal, yeah, but it's the best thing for all of us. It's going to keep us safe. We just...we just have to get patched over, and then he'll leave us alone.\"\n\n\"He'll leave us alone,\" Artemis repeats. \"I should give up my club--my club--because you think he'll keep his word?\"\n\n\"You'll lose the club anyway!\" Kallisto screams. The silence after is ringing, lasts for a solid minute before Kallisto adds, \"He's so angry, baby. We have to take his terms. Do you know what he wants to do to us? Do you know what he wants to do to you?\"\n\n\"Of course I fucking know!\"\n\n(She's known for years, known since he looked up and smiled, one hand pressing bruises into the back of Leda's neck. He did everything but touch her and she thought she was safe.\n\nWhatever she does now, it will be war: with her father first, and then whatever's left of the Olympians after. She doesn't care. She wants a war, wants bloodshed and ruin, wants the world to suffer for almost being everything she hoped for.\n\nBut this could be her child. The only child she may ever have.)\n\n\"I did it for you,\" Kallisto is sobbing. \"I did it for us.\"\n\n\"I know, baby.\" Artemis pulls the trigger.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"660704\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"gunshot\", \"Victim\": \"Kallisto\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Artemis\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 591456, "full_story": "Eldest of the sisters, Medusa alone stood the guardian of the Eastern gates of Sicani by the lapping sea. With unblinking gaze, she watched against the rising of the sun and the tides of invaders that sought to take the wide olive groves of Sicani for themselves. Her sister, Euryale, guarded the western gate with brazen hands and fearsome cries. The people of the city stood with her there. They held their shields together as impenetrable scales under her guidance. Stheno, the youngest, the softest of aspect, hers was to face the mountainous north with its crags and eagles' reach. With her yellow wings, she often flew to perch there. The great eagles and the seahawks, they flocked to her and took the flesh of the sea from her brazen hands.\n\nThe sea that lapped upon the harbor, they did not guard against. Were they not the daughters of the chthonic sea? They were the daughters of Phycys and Ceto coiled down far into the deep. They were the daughters of wine deep darkness and salt and echoes.\n\nMedusa was in love. \n\nShe did not show it easily. That was not her nature. Her nature was unblinking. Her nature was the strong slide of great coils through the rolling hills bestrewn in ancient olive groves. \n\nIn the springtime of the year, when the yellow pollen fell from the trees, she first looked out from the Eastern gate and met the gaze of grey-eyed Athena. She, the daughter of a younger god, whose father consumed her mother in a single swallow. His monstrous aspect hidden between red smacking lips and a golden beard.\n\nMedusa, she was unafraid. She strode out from her gate. Her spear in her hand. She pushed back the frozen mask of her helm, the bronze of it an eternal scream of righteous rage. The pollen fell golden upon her face. It trembled upon her lashes. Her bronze hair tumbled free. It alone indicated the tumbled nature of her feelings in that moment. That golden hour when she first met the gaze of grey-eyed Athena, wise as a serpent and contained too in her aspect.\n\nThey gazed into each other on that morning. \n\nIt would be imprudent to describe then what occurred between them. What happened when the eldest of the Gorgon sisters and Pallas Athena first met. It would be best to then say that Medusa opened her gates to Athena and let her into the city to dwell there. \n\nOn the highest hill within the polis, Medusa built for Athena a temple with wide open doors. That all might come in and find wisdom.\n\nIn the temple of Athena, they were often together. Athena at her loom, as Medusa watched her clever hands at their weaving. It was their home. They met with Euryale and shared bread drizzled with olive oil. They met with Stheno and played games. \n\nThey were in love. They pleated their fingers as one might weave the threads in a loom. They played at games together. \n\nIt would be imprudent to say more and yet, who writes with prudence that tells the tales of gods?\n\nThe kisses of their lips were as rich and golden as an olive oil of first press. Not virgin sisters kisses these, no. Medusa was a daughter of the chthonic sea. She kissed as fiercely. Athena, whose first words were a battle cry, she gave nothing way, but willing battled for Medusa's regard. Athena was the goddess of craft and arts and skill. Her fingers were clever. She crafted such things as to give her love delight. Athena greatly loved to rest her clever head upon the wild bronze masses of Medusa's hair and speak the names of clouds as they lay upon the flat roof of the temple. Medusa greatly loved to pay tribute to Athena and hold her tightly wrapped in her coils. They delighted in each other. \n\nThey were in love. \n\nThe lapping sea brushed against the sea steps that led down into the water. It was summer and all was blessed in the world. The olives grew round and ripe in the ancient olive groves that stretched into the rolling hills of the East.\n\nIn autumn of the year, the people of Sicani plucked the olives and took in the harvest. They fortified the walls of their homes. They painted the doors blue against the winter winds.\n\nThe lapping sea surged in its tides against the port of Sicani. It rose and fell. The boats of the fishermen rose and fell with it.\n\nThe wintertime came. With it the storms of grey skies and rain. In sorrowing aspect, Athena left for a journey to spend the shortest days with her father on high Olympus. That there might be some wisdom there.\n\nThey parted with sorrowing hearts and hopeful fingers. \n\nMedusa was unafraid. Stheno mourned the loss of long days of flying in blue skies. Euryale used this time in training with the people. But Medusa reveled in the rain. She walked down the sea steps and she swam in the sea. Was it not her mother? Was it not her father?\n\nAlas, Medusa had forgotten it was no longer chthonic days. There then her crime. To forget and for an instant close her eyes against the salt of the sea.\n\nFor in that winter storm, Poseidon looked upon her with her clouds of bronze hair floating in the fierce waves and found her beautiful. As she slithered back up onto the sea steps, he called to her and offered all the bounty of the sea if she would lie with him, but once. Her aspect was unchanged. She looked at him with unblinking blue-green eyes and picked up her spear in answer.\n\nShe forgot. What is a spear against the sea?\n\nThe waves roared. They crashed upon the harbor. There was no sea wall. The waves rushed past. They flooded the streets. Salt water poured past the doors painted blue. Whole families drowned. Grandmothers clutching at the plump legs of the babe just born. Euryale did what she could. She gathered her soldiers and led the people to the higher ground. Stheno battered as well she could against the wind and led them to the high passes in the mountains.\n\nMedusa, she remained. She alone was the guardian of the Eastern gates.\n\nBut this was the sea. She fell back higher and higher within the emptied city. Poseidon pursued her. She cast her spear and the waves parted before it. She climbed the steps to the temple of Athena. She went into the temple with wide open doors that all might come in and find wisdom there.\n\nIt would be cruel to speak of what occurred there on the floor of the temple of Athena. What occurred on the marble that Medusa herself had carved for her love. The sea desired. The sea took. When the waters finally receded, buildings had been thrown from their moorings. Ships lay tilted upon the flat roofs where the people had gathered in halcyon days.\n\nAnd the dead. There were so many dead. \n\nMedusa screamed. She was rage personified. \n\nShe thrashed with her coils. She did as much damage then as the sea had done. Her screams were unending. She wrent the sky with them.\n\nIn the mountains above, Euryale wept. Stheno hid her face behind her wings. The Sicani cried out in fear. \n\nThe sisters parted from them then. They went to their sister, but Medusa could not be comforted. \n\nAthena returned. \n\nTears poured down her stalwart cheeks. But Athena could only be the goddess that she was. She spoke of temperance and strategy and appeals to the law of Olympus. The blue-green gaze of Medusa met grey-eyed Athena then. She asked then what of the law for Metis? What of Athena's mother, consumed by her father, the young king of the gods. This was the rule of law. She did not say these words. She shouted them as she crashed her mighty coils. Athena gave her then the only comfort that she could.\n\nMedusa's aspect, she changed to the face of her bronze helm. An eternal scream that her voice might rest. Her bronze curls that she had so loved, that had so drawn the sea lapping softly at the sea steps, she transformed into venomous serpents that none might trifle with her again. Her eyes, the eyes of the daughter of a chthonic sea, she made as stone and to look them was to become stone. Even the sea. Even the ever changing sea would be stone were it to look therein.\n\nShe might have then have waited. But for all her wisdom, Athena was a child of a younger god. Medusa bid her leave and Athena left. Her love grew gravid with the children the sea had forced upon her that day. She would not let fall from her body. She kept them inside herself. She ripped up the ancient olive groves. She destroyed the temple. She destroyed the city. Until even Euryale and Stheno were forced to make way from the city that was polis no more. Only the dead lived there. \n\nOnly statues of heroes that sought to slay the monster that dwelt there. They wanted the treasure of Siciani. The golden casks of olive oil transmuted by time and legend into boxes of gold. \n\nThere was no treasure. The olive oil had long since gone rancid on the touch of the sea.\n\nAthena in time grew wiser then. It is not prudent to speak of the gods being unwise. But even the most clever can grow in wisdom. What were the thoughts of the goddess of craft and skill and defense when she sent Perseus with a shield as bright as a mirror to her love? It cannot be known.\n\nBut thereafter upon the shield of grey-eyed Athena, wise as a serpent, she bore the face of Medusa in her eternal rage. A goddess of wisdom may not be inclined to forgetfulness. She may also consider that in the end, even gods may die and the sea may turn to stone.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"591456\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"drowning\", \"Victim\": \"Sicani people\", \"Perpetrator\": \"sea\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"violence\", \"Victim\": \"Sicani people\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Medusa\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"petrification\", \"Victim\": \"Heroes\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Medusa\"}, \"death_event_4\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"consumption\", \"Victim\": \"Metis\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Cronus\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 57811963, "full_story": "Zoro's atheism was never a secret to anyone in the crew. He had first made it known during the time they visited Skypeia, an island floating in the sky, when they faced a so-called god who ruled the land with terror and dictatorship. Such a god was laughable as he needed to use such methods. What he had weren't believers or followers. They were prisoners trapped within the cages of his power.\n\n \n\nIf gods and goddesses were to really exist, and everything that happens is according to fate, isn't the world we live in just a book written to entertain mankind's supposed creators? Zoro has never once prayed to a god because he knows that he's the only one that could carve his fate. If he ever did face a real god, he wouldn't hesitate to draw his sword.\n\n \n\nIf gods and goddesses were real and they are pure and kind as what people acclaim, the world should be a much better place. It should be rid of evil. It should be rid of grief and anger. It should be rid of sadness, of pain, violence, and abuse. But it's not.\n\n \n\n\"So you would fight a god?\" Chopper asked with admiration visible in his eyes, twinkling in awe as he made himself comfortable on one of the couches in the crow's nest.\n\n \n\n\"I don't see why not.\" The older responded, counting his barbell reps in his head.\n\n \n\nThe kid seemed concerned. \"But they're gods, you know! And what if they're not bad?\"\n\n \n\n\"So what if they're a god?\" Zoro grunted as he put down the giant barbell, grabbing a towel to wipe his sweat dry. \"If they're not bad, then I'll leave them be. It works like that, no?\"\n\n \n\nBefore Chopper could respond, both of their attention was diverted to the sound of the trap door opening, a blond head popping out of it. It was Sanji, the crew's cook.\n\n \n\n\"Oye, you two. It's time for dinner.\" The blond notified them, Chopper immediately getting off his seat to climb down the crow's nest.\n\n \n\n\"I'll be there in a minute.\" The swordsman replied, signalling that he'd tidy up first. The other two went on to the galley while he stayed behind to gather his swords and put the things he used back to where they were placed.\n\n \n\nWhen he was done, he made his way to dine with the rest of the crew. As he was about to enter the kitchen, he noticed a little snake trying to sneak in, and his first instinct was to pick it up.\n\n \n\nIt was a peculiar snake. Its tail was severed, but it didn't look like a clean cut from a knife or a sword. Rather, it looked like it was plucked off. Neither was it bleeding. It was merely weakened, though, on the verge of dying.\n\n \n\n\"Change the fate. Save Medusa.\" He heard a voice whispering directly in his head. It travelled from ear to ear. It was eerie.\n\n \n\n\"Change the fate. Save Medusa.\" Zoro had to look around this time. The voice felt like it was passing by him. His surroundings started to become a blur.\n\n \n\n\"Change the fate. Save Medusa.\" It came from his right.\n\n \n\n\"Change the fate. Save Medusa.\" Now from the left.\n\n \n\n\"Change the fate. Save Medusa.\" The voice whispered from behind and everything went pitch black.\n\n \n\nThe swordsman, however, remained alert, right hand reaching for his sword while the other still held the snake, even as it forcefully tried to slip out of his hold.\n\n \n\nAs Zoro's eyes started to adjust to the dark, he could feel the snake growing stronger by the second. It coiled around his arm, and he only let go of it when it buried its sharp fangs under his skin accompanied by a deafening scream. \"CHANGE THE FATE!!! SAVE MEDUSA!!!\" There was a loud bang before the swordsman finally lost consciousness.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n* * *\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGods and goddesses. That concept is something Zoro is familiar with, but would never understand. Do people worship them because they really want to? Do they revere them because they feel overwhelming love, peace, and joy in their presence? Is that really the case? Or do they just worship them because they have the power to make them suffer and take their lives? Or perhaps, they just put them on such a high pedestal because they have been enslaved by the idea that was passed onto them by the previous generations? Nevertheless, Zoro would never be caught kneeling in front of a god even if his life was at stake.\n\n \n\n\"How peculiar. He has got green hair.\" He heard a woman's voice not very far from him. His head was pounding after just waking up. The bright blue sky was the first to greet Zoro as soon as he opened his eyes, birds flying high, twittering in glee. Looking to the left, he saw a line of tall trees serving as an entrance to the woods. Underneath him, he felt the soft brush of grasses against the fabric of his clothes. To his right were footsteps approaching him. \"Mister, are you alright?\"\n\n \n\n\"Uh... yeah.\" Zoro groaned as he pulled himself up, still feeling a bit woozy. Now that he had a clear look at his surroundings, he immediately concluded that he was separated from the crew. He wasn't sure how, but it was certainly related to that snake he found outside the galley. \"Do you know what place this is?\"As the swordsman looked at the person who approached him, he was slightly taken aback at how fair-looking the maiden was. She had long, beautiful locks that glistened under the gentle rays of sunlight. Her skin was smoother than porcelain, putting even snow to shame at how white it was. Her eyes were the prettiest he had seen, fiercely staring straight into him with kindness and warmth. However, what caught his attention was her elegance as she carried herself in her beautiful white dress. Though the design was something he had never seen before.\n\n \n\n\"Am I in a foreign country?\"\n\n \n\n\"I believe so, sir. Given the way you dress, I am quite certain that you are not one of the people of Greece.\" The woman answered, politeness apparent in her tone, adjusting her hold on the porcelain jar she was carrying.\n\n \n\n\"Greece? Where even is that?\" Zoro whispered to himself, his stomach suddenly making a rumbling sound which made him flush. He remembered that he didn't get to eat dinner before he got in this place.\n\n \n\n\"Oh, my. Are you, perhaps, hungry? I would like to offer you food, but I still need to fetch some water for Goddess Athena's temple.\" The woman seemed conflicted. \"Would you be willing to wait?\"\n\n \n\nGoddess Athena? Who?\n\n \n\n\"Ah- yeah, thanks. Sure.\" Zoro scratched the back of his neck, not wanting to refuse the beautiful maiden's offer of free food. \"I'll help you carry that in return.\"\n\n \n\n\"I would be much grateful. Thank you.\" The lady smiled as she handed the jar to Zoro and led the way towards the well where she planned to fetch the water. \"If I may ask, what do your companions call you, sir? You don't seem to know about this place. Where are you from?\"\n\n \n\n\"I'm Zoro. I'm from East Blue. Though I'm not sure if you know that place. I got separated from my crew after a snake bit me.\" The swordsman explained which made the woman gasp, concerned after Zoro mentioned that he was bitten by a snake. \"What about you? Why are you getting some water for a goddess' temple? You a nun or something?\"\n\n \n\n\"Not quite. I am a priestess of Goddess Athena's temple. They call me Medusa.\"\n\n \n\nMedusa? Why does that name sound so familiar? Where did he hear that name again?\n\n \n\n\"The water is for service within the temple. We use it for offering mostly. Goddess Athena has done a lot for us. She provided us with useful tools and knowledge, and we're honoring her by serving in her temple.\" Medusa further explained, a smile curving up her lips as she talked so highly of this goddess. As much as Zoro disliked the idea of serving a god, or a goddess in this case, he remained silent while listening to the woman. He was still trying to remember where he had heard her name. \"You should come visit the temple with me. I'll show you Goddess Athena's statue.\"\n\n \n\nThe swordsman just nodded along, filling the jar with water from the well and walked again with Medusa back to the temple. All she did was talk about how great the goddess was. She talked about her tales of honor as well as how she was looking up to her as a woman. Athena being the goddess of war and wisdom, Medusa was revering her, sounding a bit like Sanji, to be very honest.\n\n \n\nZoro also learned that there were other gods and goddesses aside from Athena. One of them was Zeus, which had the same name as that cloud thing Nami stole from Big Mom. There was also someone called Poseidon, which shared the same name with an ancient weapon (who turned out to be Shirahoshi, the mermaid princess). The swordsman was just listening, commenting from time to time, but mostly doubting if they really are gods and goddesses based on Medusa's stories. To him, they just sounded like people who happened to have \"powers\". Kind of like the five elders residing at the \"Holy Land Mary Geoise\" or whatever it was called.\n\n \n\nUpon arriving at the temple, Zoro immediately saw a giant statue in the middle, at the base of it were engraved letters Zoro were unfamiliar with, but he assumed they spelled the goddess' name. Medusa introduced the statue to him, informing him that they are planning to clean the whole temple a week from now to prepare for something Zoro couldn't be bothered to remember. Excusing herself to bring the water to the inner sanctum of the temple, the woman left the swordsman in front of the statue, saying she'll be right back.\n\n \n\n\"So this is Athena,\" the greenhead whispered as he looked up at the statue's face, shrugging in indifference. \"I don't see anything special with it.\"\n\n \n\nBut well, if Medusa thinks so highly of her, then maybe she's got something good with her. It's just that, he could not be convinced about believing in such deities. Maybe if he witnessed their \"greatness\" himself, he might believe in their existence.\n\n \n\nMedusa did not take long before she came back, saying she had given the task of changing the offerings for Athena's statue to one of her fellow priestesses. Once again, she had talked about her beloved goddess as they made their way to Medusa's home. Does she not ever get tired of talking about this Athena woman? Zoro just silently sighed in secret.\n\n \n\n\"While I reheat the stew, let me treat your wound first, Zoro, sir. Did you not mention that you were bitten by a snake?\" The lady brought up as she placed a pot on a stove made of stones, proceeding to get some herbs and cloths from the other side of the place.\n\n \n\n\"Oh, I'm fine. It doesn't hurt anymore.\" Zoro subtly refused, not wanting to be treated as he always does, even with Chopper.\n\n \n\n\"But it's dangerous. You don't know if the snake was venomous. Isn't it better to be safe, rather than regretting it later?\" Medusa argued, bringing a weaved tray full of what she would need to dress up Zoro's wound. As she sat in front of the swordsman, she showed him her palms, gesturing for Zoro to place his arm there. \"Let me see it. It must've hurt.\"\n\n \n\nWith no other choice, Zoro obliged. However, the both of them were surprised to see that the wound had fully closed, leaving only a mark of where it buried its fangs. What's more surpising was the fact that there was an image of snake coiling around Zoro's arm, extending from where the wound was.\n\n \n\n\"That's strange. This doesn't look like a fresh wound.\" Medusa commented.\n\n \n\n\"I'm as surprised as you are. What the heck is this? A tattoo?\" Zoro blurted out as he looked closely at the image of the snake, not concerned about the wound at all.\n\n \n\n\"Well, I'm just glad that you're not hurt.\"\n\n \n\n\"I told you, I wasn't.\"\n\n \n\nWhen the stew was ready, Medusa served it in wooden bowls that Zoro usually sees in taverns, though the design was different. They shared a meal, talking more about Athena and her temple. Zoro learned that not everyone could become a priestess serving under the goddess. There were conditions that must be met, and one of them was for the priestesses to preserve their chastity while in service. This is due to Athena being a virgin goddess. The swordsman did not say anything to this, but he still frowned at the thought of it. He found it foolish. How is chastity a good basis for one's faithfulness? If you're a god, wouldn't it make more sense to want their unwavering loyalty towards you rather than a wordly title? Nonetheless, he still listened.\n\n \n\nHe was ever grateful for Medusa for feeding him and for offering to treat his wounds.\n\n \n\n\"I'll be honest, Zoro, sir. When I found you, I thought you were a ruffian. However, you were different from the men I have come across before.\" Medusa confessed, a bit embarrassed that she assumed the wrong thing. \"You are a great listener. I've never been able to talk about Goddess Athena this much because no one would listen.\"\n\n \n\n\"Yeah, well. I don't mind the blabbering.\" Zoro responded, thinking about how he had known people who are more of a blabbermouth than Medusa was. Let's take Perona for example. The woman was annoying. \"What do you mean different though?\"\n\n \n\n\"Ah- it's just, they are quick to take advantage of a woman.\" The woman answered.\n\n \n\n\"Why don't you just fight back then?\" Zoro asked.\n\n \n\n\"I- how could I even? I'm a woman. I'm not strong. I would never stand a chance against a man.\" Medusa was startled at the question.\n\n \n\n\"What do you mean? Isn't your goddess a fighter? She's a woman, she's strong, and based on your stories, she definitely won against many men.\" Now, Zoro was confused.\n\n \n\nThe woman, on the other hand, was taken aback, not sure what to answer. \"Well, sir, she's a goddess. I am just a mere mortal.\"\n\n \n\n\"What difference does that make? I know a lot of women who can kick men's asses. It's just a matter of courage. Though a training would be a big help.\"\n\n \n\nWhat Zoro said stuck in Medusa's head, replaying over and over like a broken record. It got her thinking. Would she still be accepted by Goddess Athena if she learned how to fight? Would men who are trying to get into her bed finally leave her alone if she stood up for herself? Would she be safe from people's judgemental gazes if she fought back?\n\n \n\nFor days, Medusa has been thinking about it. Not that it bothered her, but her interest was piqued by what Zoro had suggested. It would be great if she could stand up for herself like Goddess Athena. For many years of following her, she had never thought of using her as a motivation to get strong as well. How great would it be to be able to protect not just yourself, but your fellow women as well?\n\n \n\nWhile the swordsman was left alone in her house, who promised to chop up some logs, the priestess went on to continue with her duties. The beautiful lady brought a porcelain jar with her as she went out of the temple to fetch some water for their service. It was a bright, sunny day. The birds were chirping away in the air, butterflies playing with the budding flowers of spring. It was a nice day for a priestess like Medusa.\n\n \n\n\"So you are the maiden who has captured the heart of many men in Athens,\" a low, raspy voice suddenly spoke from inside the well which startled Medusa, causing her to drop the jar on the ground, shattering in pieces as the water splashed everywhere.\n\n \n\n\"W-who's in there...?\" The woman was frightened as she looked around, cautious that someone might approach her from behind. However, what surprised her was how the water on the ground were forming droplets, gathering and crawling back inside the well.\n\n \n\n\"It is I, the God of the Seas,\" the voice answered. Medusa could hear the bubbling of water from inside the well, and the thought of another god visiting her terrified her more than anything else. What could God Poseidon possibly want from her? \"Bow before me, mortal.\"\n\n \n\nThe water rose from the well, its transparency slowly gaining colors as the figure of Poseidon emerged, stepping on the same ground she stood. Medusa hid her trembling hands, backing up a bit as the god loomed over her with his tall stature.\n\n \n\n\"Priestess Medusa, you are a beautiful woman. Come with me and bear my child.\" The god told her, approaching with his trident in his hand. This was when Medusa felt how the air shifted its course. The once bright sky slowly turned gray, the air breezing through her skin strongly.\n\n \n\n\"I apologize, your greatness, sir. I am but a mere mortal.\" Medusa's voice cracked as she refused the god. \"Also, I am Goddess Athena's follower. I will never dream of leaving my duties.\"\n\n \n\nAt the mention of Athena's name, Poseidon's expression changed, him grabbing the poor priestess by the arm. \"Insolence! Are you refusing a god?!\"\n\n \n\nMedusa gasped at the pain of having her arm grabbed by a powerful god. However, that did not stop her from trying to run, kicking the god's groin as she remembered what Zoro told her.\n\n \n\n\"The fastest way to make a man kneel is to kick his balls.\" He said.\n\n \n\nIt definitely came in handy as Poseidon lost hold of her due to pain. Medusa used that chance to escape. She ran as fast as she could back to the temple, tears streaming down her face. She was terrified of what the god of the sea would do to her. She is afraid of the fact that Poseidon has that power. At times like this, she could only think of one person who would protect her: Her patron god.\n\n \n\nGoddess Athena will surely help her.\n\n \n\nGoddess Athena will protect her.\n\n \n\nGoddess Athena will protect her chastity as a woman.\n\n \n\nGoddess Athena will protect her against Poseidon.\n\n \n\nUpon reaching the temple, Medusa immediately kneeled in front of Athena's statue, begging and crying for her help. She knelt and prayed to the goddess she revered for her protection as she hope for Poseidon to just let her go. She called for her goddess' name in desperation.\n\n \n\nHowever, no god heard her pleas. No god arrived to defend her from the primal urge of another god. No god was there to protect her and her virtue.\n\n \n\nAll she could hear was her own voice, screaming and crying for help as Poseidon forcefully ripped her dress in front of Athena's statue. All she could hear were the thunders and heavy rain masking her muffled screams under the god's hand that was covering her mouth as he started to defile her body. All she could hear was the god's disgusting grunts and groans as he stained the purity she protected her whole life for the goddess she serves. All she could hear was the porcelain jar from earlier shattering into pieces as her chastity also shattered like a fragile glass.\n\n \n\nHow could a god do this to her? How could a god do this in the temple of another god? How? HOW? HOW COULD POSEIDON DO SUCH A FILTHY THING?\n\n \n\n\"Zoro... sir...\" Medusa cried her last cry for hope, tears streaming down her face as she thought of everything he had said. If only she was stronger. If only she had more courage. If only she had power. If only she had those, this wouldn't have happen. This wouldn't have gone like this.\n\n \n\nAs the rain poured down, Zoro grew worried for the priestess. He felt how the air from earlier felt heavy, felt suffocating. He remembered what Medusa told him.\n\n \n\n\"The gods and goddesses are everywhere. They protect their people, that's why we are safe.\" She said.\n\n \n\nBut for some reason, he couldn't stay still. He's even more worried because his instincts were usually right, and Zoro doesn't even believe in deities.  What could they even do when they're in heaven or wherever the hell they are?\n\n \n\nThe swordsman grabbed his swords and rushed out in the middle of the pouring rain. He couldn't even see were he was going at how thick it was.\n\n \n\n\"Change the fate! Save Medusa!\" A familiar voice screamed in his head along with the image of the snake on his arm glowing in the rain. As if it had a mind of its own, his arm started to drag him in a particular direction, as the voice repeatedly screams, \"Change the fate! Save Medusa!\"\n\n \n\nSHIT. SHIT. SHIT!\n\n \n\nSo that's where he heard her name! She's why he was brought here! Fuck it. What could've happened to her? Fuck. Fuck.\n\n \n\nZoro was not surprised when he reached the temple. Somehow, he assumed that this was where Medusa was. His arm stopped glowing as well. What came to him as shock, however, was the voices he could hear from inside.\n\n \n\n\"Silence! I will not hear any more of your excuses, mortal!\" A woman's voice echoed throughout the whole temple. It was big and full of authority. \"You dare defile my temple with your filthy wordly urges! And with a god known to be an enemy of mine!\"\n\n \n\n\"Goddess Athena, please... b-believe me... I would never do such thing that would incur your wrath. I am your faithful follower...\" Zoro heard Medusa's pleading voice.\n\n \n\nWhat is happening? That goddess is here? She's mad at Medusa?\n\n \n\n\"And you, Poseidon! Leave at once if you want a war be waged right here and now!\"\n\n \n\nAll of a sudden, a human-figure in the form of water passed by Zoro and merged with the rain. What the heck was that? A devil fruit? But it's not the time for that. Zoro needs to see if Medusa was alright.\n\n \n\n\"You must pay for your crime, mortal,\" Athena draw her sword, but before she could point it at Medusa who was on the floor with her dressed tattered and her face a mess, Zoro jumped in to fend for her, eyes glaring at the goddess before him.\n\n \n\n\"Not so fast, woman.\" Zoro spoke through his gritted teeth, Athena looking at him with both anger and surprise.\n\n \n\n\"Insolent fool... who do you think you are, interfering with a goddess?!\" Athena was able to push Zoro back with her sword. Her voice roared through the whole temple.\n\n \n\n\"Who the fuck cares if you're a goddess...\" Zoro tightened his grip on Wado Ichmonji as he glanced at Medusa who was on the floor. He could see how much of a mess she had become, and what caught his attention was the blood dripping down her legs. He immediately understood what happened, putting Wado Ichimonji back in its sheathe and taking off his coat to put it around the priestess. His hands were shaking with anger. He could not believe his eyes. \"What kind of goddess gets mad at her follower for losing her virginity after being ravaged by her fellow god, and lets the fucking bastard go without any questions asked? What kind of goddess blames the victim of assault and intends to punish her because of it? And you're supposed to be a god?! Don't make me laugh! You're no difference from that Poseidon bastard, Athena!\"The goddess' eyes were bloodshot at what she heard from the swordsman. It was the first time she had received such disrespect from a mortal. How dare he talk to her like that? How dare he insult a goddess?\n\n \n\n\"Shut your filthy mouth, mortal! You know nothing of me.\" Athena clenched her teeth in anger. \"You shall be punished along with this dirty woman!!\"\n\n \n\nAthena began attacking the swordsman to which he immediately defended, countering with both Sandai Kitetsu and Enma in his hands. He exchanged blows with the goddess of war, causing damage all over the temple, including Athena's statue.\n\n \n\n\"I may know nothing of you, but I know Medusa!\" Zoro evaded Athena's attack, but it was still able to graze his cheek. The swordsman didn't pay attention to it, and instead prepared for another attack. \"She talked so highly of you. She's your most loyal follower. If I know, she probably even cried for your help while that bastard was defiling her. But where were you?! Instead of appearing to protect your priestess, you arrived at the last minute only to blame her for everything that had happened. Are gods and goddesses a joke? You guys are supposed to be your people's protector, but look at what you're doing? You're the ones causing them grief!\" Zoro landed a hit on the goddess.\n\n \n\n\"Enough of your foolishness! I am not listening to the likes of you! You're just a filthy mortal.\" Athena made it hard for Zoro to parry despite their speed matching each other's. Her swordsmanship was definitely something she could brag about. Even Zoro would not deny that. However, her confidence will be her downfall. As she continued to look down on Zoro for being a mortal, her moves became sloppy and full of openings. Even if she was a goddess, a swordsman like Zoro would easily spot her weakness.\n\n \n\n\"And you're just a god.\" Zoro wore his bandana around his head and put Wado Ichimonji in his mouth, letting Enma draw out as much haki as it could. Zoro infused it and his two swords with not just Armament Haki, but also Conqueror's Haki. Black lightning and a green smoke-like aura emanated from his three swords as he prepared for an attack.\n\n \n\nAthena, on the other hand, was angered by Zoro's words. She's usually a rational woman, but to get insulted like that by a man is like having a spear struck her throat. She would never accept it. \"Come.\" She bravely told Zoro, holding tightly on her sword and shield.\n\n \n\n\"King of Hell...\" Zoro muttered through his teeth. \"Santoryu!!\" Athena and Zoro's swords clashed, creating a huge earthquake that alarmed the whole Athens. The temple started to crumble at the big explosion it caused.\n\n \n\n\"Incredible! I have never met a human like you.\" There was a grin curving up Athena's lips as their swords danced through the rhythm of stones and concrete crumbling around them. Perhaps one of the rare times she had smiled.\n\n \n\nAs much as the two wanted to continue the fight, the temple was about to complete fall down. They had no choice but to stop and get out of there, Zoro immediately grabbing Medusa with him to escape.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n* * *\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe temple of Athena that once stood as one of the most sacred was now brought to the dust by a fight no one ever imagined would ensue. It had its pride just like its patron god, but perhaps, having it brought down was not such a bad thing.\n\n \n\n\"I understand the situation now.\" Athena clenched her fists, apologetic for the actions she chose to take. \"I will see to it that Poseidon gets what he deserves.\"\n\n \n\n\"As you should. Tsk.\" Zoro commented. Athena just glared at him while she was consoling her follower. The three of them were by the woods, right where Medusa found Zoro. It had a good distance from the temple, which was an advantage for hiding Athena's presence in the realm of the humans.\n\n \n\n\"Medusa, I know this event caused you so much grief and trauma. As a form of my apology, would you accept a blessing from me?\" The goddess asked Medusa who finally stopped weeping. The human girl just nodded, and Athena gathered her powers in her palm. She touched her hair and they turned into snakes, ones that were gentle and warm. Medusa got taken aback, but Athena assured her. \"You may call on these snakes at will. Should you sense any danger, call upon them and your hair will transform. They will protect you from any danger by turning those who wish to harm you into stone.\"\n\n \n\n\"Thank you, Goddess Athena. I am ever grateful for your kindness.\" Medusa sobbed as the snakes turned back into her hair.\n\n \n\n\"I am not the one you should give your gratitude.\" Athena glanced at Zoro's direction. \"As much as I hate to admit it, this guy was the one who opened my eyes from my foolishness. That said, may I know your name? I've never fought a mortal like you. You rival even some of the gods' talent in swordsmanship.\"\"Zoro. Roronoa Zoro.\" The swordsman answered.\n\n \n\n\"I see. I am thankful of you, Zoro.\" Athena calmly said, and Zoro just nodded.\n\n \n\nNot even a minute passed, the image of the snake on Zoro's arm started to glow once again. This time, Zoro knew it was time to go.\n\n \n\n\"Medusa,\" he called for the woman's name. \"Now you've got a reason to fight back. Make sure you use your power well.\"\n\n \n\n\"Yes, Zoro, sir. Thank you very much. I will never forget what you did for me.\" Medusa smiled gently at him.\n\n \n\n\"And you goddess, treat your followers right. You don't get to use being a goddess as an excuse to do whatever the fuck you want. But I'm glad to have fought you. You're one of the proofs that women can be stronger than men. Tod bad Kuina won't get to meet you.\"\n\n \n\n\"I am ashamed, but yes. I will keep that in mind.\" Athena nodded. \"Kuina?\"\n\n \n\n\"Ah, no one.\" Zoro shrugged.\n\n \n\nWhen his arm finally stopped glowing, Zoro once again was engulfed by the dark. However, he could feel the snake on his arm crawl out of his skin, giving him a gentle little hug before it was finally gone.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you for saving Medusa.\" He heard faintly before he lost his consciousness.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n* * *\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIf gods and goddesses were real, Zoro would not hesitate to fight them. If gods and goddesses were real and they are pure and kind as what people acclaim, the world should be a much better place. It should be rid of evil. It should be rid of grief and anger. It should be rid of sadness, of pain, violence, and abuse. But it's not.\n\n \n\nAfter crossing paths with a goddess, does Zoro finally believe in them?\n\n \n\nThe answer is... no.\n\n \n\nPeople say that a god is a perfect being, not capable of sinning, not capable of making rash decisions. They are supposed to be understanding, forgiving, and strives for what's right. What Zoro met was not a god. It was a being with human emotions and human mistakes. He would not dismiss the idea if people want to believe in those. But for him, Athena was someone whom he shared the luxury of a good fight.\n\n \n\nWhich is why there's one thing Zoro would like to redress: He doesn't believe in god.\n\n \n\nNot in a way that he still fully rejects their existence, but in a way that they are still akin to humans. After all, a mere mortal like him had to lecture a goddess with how to handle things better. There's no way he'd believe and put his trust on a god like that.\n\n \n\n\"Marimo!\" Sanji smacked the swordsman's head, immediately feeling the pain.\n\n \n\n\"What the fuck are you doing?!\"\n\n \n\n\"What the fuck are YOU doing?!\" The cook dragged him inside the galley, his brows kissing each other. \"You're making us wait! What were you dreaming about outside the kitchen? The fuck.\"\n\n \n\nAs Zoro looked around, he saw everyone in the crew, looking at him with worried faces.\n\n \n\n\"Are you sure you're not overfatigued, Zoro?\" Robin asked him which made Chopper gasp.\n\n \n\n\"I knew you were training too hard again!\" The little doctor blurted out.\n\n \n\n\"What- no! I'm fine!\" Zoro defended himself. \"Let's just eat.\"\n\n \n\nLuffy's eyes twinkled. \"THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR! PASS ME THE MEAT!\"\n\n \n\n \n\n ", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"57811963\", \"death_event_1\": { \"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"n/a\", \"Victim\": \"Kuina\", \"Perpetrator\": \"n/a\"} } ```"}

{"work_id": 50126794, "full_story": "You were a talented explorer seeking ancient relics for fame and fortune.\n\nYou used a combination of minor magic to speak to the dead and serious investigation to discern the location of the fabled Minotaur labyrinth.\n\nIt was deep within an enchanted cave system that in many ways served as an extension of the maze hidden away within.\n\nYou carefully navigated the treacherous caves until you came upon the secret entrance. You placed your hand in the middle of a smooth wall and uttered the magic incantation.\n\nThe wall dissolved in a flash of light, and you stepped through the entrance as the stone reformed behind you. This was it. You were in the maze proper. What secrets lie ahead?\n\nOf course, you knew the legends of Asterion the Minotaur, but he had been slain in them. And nothing could live so long anyway, especially without food.\n\nYou navigated the stone corridors easily. Despite their age, they still looked brand new.\nAs you continued on, you occasionally heard what sounded like hooves plodding along behind you.\n\nYou pushed it from your mind. Your imagination was playing tricks.\n\nAs you stepped around a corner, you came to a wooden door and opened it. When you stepped through, gone were the twisting stone paths filled with the scent of earth.\n\nInstead, there was an ancient style dwelling overlooking some farmland growing a variety of trees, bushes, and vines.\n\nThe door you had come through was still behind you, you closed it and from this side it looked like a door to a shed. So the labyrinth had pocket dimensions... You had heard about them in passing. You wondered how large it was. The realm may look like an idyllic farm on earth, but if you went far enough away, you'd surely hit an invisible wall.\n\nPerhaps the door to the house would lead further into the dungeon.\n\nAs you got closer, you realized how large it was. When you pushed the big door open, it actually was a house. Albeit with furniture that was made for someone very large.\n\nSuddenly, you felt a hot breath at your neck. You turned to find the very large, naked Minotaur staring down at you. He was a hairy wall of muscle. One with the head of a bull, complete with metal tipped horns. His legs were covered in dark fur and ended in large hooves, and his full nutsack dangled beneath a frighteningly large prick.\n\nBefore you could react, the Minotaur grabbed you and pulled off all your clothing.\n\nYou had no idea how Asterion could have survived all this time. He had been killed!\n\nBut apparently, he hadn't gotten the memo.\n\nIn the past, he had consumed most humans that wandered into his labyrinthine prison, but you were bravely entering his home, his nest.\n\nYou weren't cowering like the old sacrifices. Well, you weren't before he grabbed you anyway.\n\nThat, combined with him being in rut and driven insane by thousands of years of isolation, made him not consider you as a meal for even a moment. You were firmly in the mate category in his brain.\n\nSo small and cute.\n\nYou writhed and fought to get out of his grasp but he ignored your greatest efforts as if they were nothing.\n\nAsterion licked at your face as you pleaded with him to let you go.\n\nHe couldn't understand your language but he could guess at their meaning.\n\nBut he had no intention of ever letting this new mate of his go.\n\nHe tossed you down on the bed and you now saw what he intended to do.\n\nHis hard cock now at full arousal, as large and thick as a man's arm.\n\n\"No no no! Pleasepleasenono!!!\" Your words blended together in a garbled panic as his musk hit your nose, sharp and dominating.\n\nThe only preparation your entrance received was a few gobs of slimy Minotaur saliva before he slammed inside you.\n\nYou shrieked.\n\nIt felt as though your entrance was on fire. As if it was being ripped apart.\n\nWith every thrust you shuddered in pain and sobbed. Nearly incoherent cries for mercy dribbled from your lips and fell on deaf ears.\n\nYou felt so warm and tight around him. This was just what he needed. Surely you had been sent to Asterion in his time of need by the gods. They finally, after eons, granted him mercy in the form of your insides.\n\nSo pliant to his girthy cock. Every time he dove back into you the outline could be seen in your stomach.\n\nTears streamed down your face as you silently wept, no longer able to scream or even babble your silly little pleas for it to stop.\n\nAsterion wished he could tell you how well you were doing. That you were such a good cow for him. That you fit his cock so perfectly.\n\nBut he couldn't, so instead settled for licking and nibbling at your neck before wiping your tears away with his broad tongue.\n\nWith a final thrust he filled your belly visibly cum.\n\nWhen he pulled out a torrent of his seed rushed down your thighs, it had noticeable streaks of pink from bleeding. You were such a fragile little thing compared to him.\n\nHe hadn't been able to hold back since that was the first time he had ever sought release inside of someone before, but he made note to be more careful.\n\nEven though the breeding had stopped you were helpless. Broken. At least for the moment. You still cried silently, feeling utterly invaded and defiled.\n\nAsterion took the time to lick you completely clean before laying down beside you and holding you close, spooning you with his mighty arm as you shook beneath it.\n\nYou came here to explore the deepest reaches of the maze... but had your deepest reaches explored instead...", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"50126794\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"sexual assault\", \"Victim\": \"Explorer\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Asterion\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 47882395, "full_story": "\"Who are you? What are you doing here?\"\n\nThe girl was pretty, Medea supposed. Pretty enough for a man like Jason, anyway. Wrists as thin as a sparrow's legs, hair golden brown and tumbling down her back in soft waves. She was staring at Medea with the haughty expression of a girl raised with the knowledge of her superiority, yet her voice wavered.\n\n\"Who am I?\" Medea smiled, rising from the foot of the bed where she had sat for hours, waiting for precisely this moment. She took a step towards her husband's new bride, her smiling widening as the girl shuffled back. \"I think you know who I am. Are you afraid of me? Why?\"\n\n\"You...\" said Glauce, trailing off as she took another step backwards and collided with the door to her chamber. She blinked several times in quick succession, eyes darting around the room in futile hope of a way out. \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"I'm here to wish you well,\" said Medea.\n\nGlauce's eyes narrowed, suspicious. \"Why would you do that?\"\n\nMedea tilted her head, considering. It seemed the girl wasn't a complete fool. She would need to tread carefully, for now.\n\n\"I admit when I first learned that my husband was abandoning me for another woman, I was... less than happy. But we've spoken now. When you've known someone for so many years, it's not hard to understand one another's point of view.\"\n\nThat was what Medea had once believed to be true. Between her and Jason, surely any disagreement could be resolved! They were meant to be partners, equals, facing life's difficulties as one. But the truth was that he never saw her as someone to captain the ship alongside him as it ploughed through roiling waters. To him, she was just a faded bartering piece he could trade in for whenever something shiny and new caught his eye.\n\nWell, Medea could join him in this game, too.\n\nGlauce was watching her, lips pursed. \"He's not your husband. That's what my father said: Jason never really married you. That's why he can marry me instead.\"\n\nMedea's jaw twitched. She wanted to close the gap between them and slap the girl across the face. Instead, she gave her a sickly smile. \"There are different customs, in my homeland. Where I'm from, we are married, so forgive a foolish old woman for saying so.\"\n\n\"Is that where you'll be going?\" said Glauce, tipping up her chin as if filled with a sudden burst of confidence. \"Back to your homeland? My father said you were leaving.\"\n\n\"Did he?\" Medea raised an eyebrow. \"I won't be going back. No one there would be particularly glad to see me, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Glauce folded her arms across her chest. \"What did you do?\"\n\nMedea turned away from the girl. What did she do? Back then, she would have said she acted out of love, clearing Jason's path and saving his life. She thought she had bound him to her forever with her sacrifice. Now, she knew she had betrayed her own family for nothing but a sham.\n\n\"It's too long ago to bother mentioning,\" she said. \"You would have been a small child.\"\n\nShe heard Glauce shift her weight back against the door, discomfit seeping in again to replace her brief, misguided boldness.\n\n\"I have children with him,\" said Medea. \"Two sons, younger than you.\" She kept her back turned. The performance needed to be convincing and, if she faced Glauce now, she would not be able to hide the bloodlust in her eyes. \"So, I do understand what it's like for your father to want the best for his child. You're his only daughter, of course he thinks you should marry well. And who better than Jason? I can't fault him for his choice.\"\n\nIt was true enough. Creon was a laughable coward she would happily see dead, but he was not the one to blame. The one with the power to refuse, to hold steadfast to his promises, was Jason--and great hero that he was, he failed.\n\n\"Do you fault me?\" said Glauce. It was an astute question, smarter than Medea expected.\n\nShe graced the girl with a glance from over her shoulder. \"What is there to fault?\"\n\nGlauce drew in a breath, surprise slackening her jaw. She had nothing to say to that, so Medea continued uninterrupted.\n\n\"To prove I mean you no ill will, I brought you a gift,\" she said. She turned around, reaching beneath her cloak for the bundle she had brought, wrapped tightly in linen and bound with reeds.\n\nGlauce stared at her, unmoving.\n\n\"It's usually polite to accept a wedding gift, when it's offered,\" said Medea. \"It isn't much more than a trinket from my homeland, so I hope you'll forgive me if it doesn't live up to your other gifts. Our means are far humbler than yours, but this kind of thing is considered a great treasure among my people.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Despite her hesitation, there was a glint of something greedy in Glauce's eyes. She was hooked, like a fish on a line, and all Medea needed to do was reel her in.\n\n\"Well, you can find out, if you take it from me.\"\n\nGlauce hesitated a moment longer--but her curiosity was too strong. She reached out like a child grabbing for sweets. Medea yielded the gift, and Glauce rushed past her to unwrap it on the bed. Medea watched her, the way the greed in her eyes turned to wonder as the linen fell away to reveal sparkling gold thread on deep red silk. Red like passion, red like blood.\n\n\"It's beautiful!\" Glauce exclaimed, unable to help herself. She turned to Medea, eyes wide and only a little wary, for all the wrong reasons. \"Can--can I try it on?\"\n\n\"It's yours,\" said Medea, waving a hand. \"Go ahead. It should slip right over your head, so you won't need one of your serving girls to pin it for you.\"\n\nNever let it be said that she hadn't planned this meticulously.\n\nGlauce's hands ran over the cloth, skimming the embroidery and letting the silk fall through her fingers like water.\n\nMedea waited, heart banging out a rhythmic drumbeat of anticipation.\n\nGlauce lifted the flimsy silk up and admired it. She glanced at Medea, a nervous furrow in her brow. Medea made a show of averting her eyes, as though modesty was her chief concern, and stepped forward to tug the pins from Glauce's white chiton. Her fingers brushed over the girl's waist, making her shiver. Before Medea could ruin her plan, she moved back. Slowly, Glauce shed her chiton. She stood naked for only a short flash of time, long enough for Medea to glimpse an expanse of golden skin dotted with little moles on her back and shoulders. Then, Glauce slid the folds of cloth apart and tugged it over her head. There was a moment where she was lost in the gown, drowning in its red and gold threads--and then her honey curls emerged, and the dress billowed around her like flames licking at her skin.\n\nHow apt.\n\n\"How does it look?\" Glauce asked, biting her lip like she knew it wasn't a question she should ask the wife of her betrothed.\n\nBut Medea was willing enough to indulge her, just this once. \"As beautiful as Aphrodite herself,\" she said. It was an exaggeration, of course, but the girl was a beauty, that much was undeniable. Medea's pulse beat wildly in her throat, a spike of excitement lancing through her and leaving her voice breathy when she asked: \"How does it feel?\"\n\nGlauce's cheeks were pinkening, and she patted at the loose sleeves of the dress. \"Hot...\" she said, confusion written in the downward turn of her lips. The dress was made of silk, light and airy, even with its masterful embroidery weighing it down. There was no reason for it to feel so stifling. Except...\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Medea, like a thought had just struck her. \"I forgot--the reason this dress is so highly prized by my people is that it's laced with a special pollen from a rare plant.\"\n\n\"Pollen?\" Glauce sounded distracted, her hands scrubbing at her arms, trying to lift the silk away from her skin. \"Is that why it's so itchy?\"\n\n\"That's a side effect,\" said Medea. \"It's an aphrodisiac pollen, to assist with the wedding night.\"\n\n\"It...\" Glauce's head jerked, eyes widening as she stared over at Medea in dawning horror. \"My wedding is tomorrow. I can't... Jason...\"\n\n\"Who said anything about Jason?\" said Medea. \"Don't bring him into it.\" She crossed the gap between her and the girl. Before she came here, she had been sure to swallow the antidote to this particular plant's effects. Glauce would suffer alone.\n\nWhen she reached out a hand to cup the girl's jaw, Glauce flinched away.\n\nMedea tutted and grabbed her by the chin. \"Don't fight it,\" she said. \"Many stronger than you have tried and failed.\"\n\nGlauce's lips parted, a soft moan leaving her in a long exhale.\n\n\"Make it stop,\" she mumbled, although she made no attempt to tear herself away from Medea's grip.\n\n\"I will,\" said Medea. \"But perhaps this will teach you to be careful what you ask for.\"\n\nShe shoved the girl backwards, down onto the bed. Glauce gasped, trying to roll over and right herself, but Medea was quick to climb over her, pinning her down with her weight. The girl shook her head, fists coming up to strike at Medea's chest.\n\n\"Leave me alone!\"\n\n\"I thought you wanted me to make it stop?\" Medea laughed at the faint pressure of Glauce's weak blows. \"I can't do both.\"\n\n\"It... what... how?\" Glauce's face was scarlet now, the muscles in her legs twitching under Medea's body as she strained her hips up, seeking for friction to soothe an ache she didn't know how to explain.\n\nMedea pressed a finger over her lips. The girl might be a beauty, but her incessant babbling was quick to grate on Medea's nerves.\n\n\"Be quiet, and I'll show you how,\" she told Glauce.\n\nShe drew her finger from Glauce's mouth down to her chin, then past the hollow of her collar to her feverish chest. She laid her hand over Glauce's heart, felt its rabbit-quick flutter. The girl's insides were only separated from her by skin and bone. Medea felt a wild urge to sink her claws in until her hand was nestled inside the girl's chest, holding her heart between her fingertips. She wondered what shape it would be, how soft it would feel.\n\nGlauce's breath hitched, almost a sob. She was watching Medea with clouded eyes, opening her mouth without any words to say.\n\nMedea shifted her hand lowered, to cover one of Glauce's breasts through the fabric. Her cunt throbbed at the way the girl gasped and arched up. She pinched at Glauce's nipple through the thin silk, watching the fabric cling to the shape of her breasts as the girl twisted and mewled underneath her.\n\n\"Please, please, please,\" Glauce whispered, like a prayer to the gods. And how could Medea refuse such sweet supplication?\n\nShe drew herself up, shifting the girl onto her side and rucking up the skirt of the red gown to expose Glauce's slender legs. Medea pushed her own skirts impatiently to the side, slotting herself between Glauce's parted legs, until her cunt was pressed against Glauce's. The girl was whimpering, fingers scrabbling at the bedsheets beneath her. Tears were welling in her eyes, and Medea couldn't help but brush them away with a fingertip as they spilled over, licking the salt from her own skin.\n\nGlauce was slick between the legs, her desperate arousal obvious. Medea laughed as she ground her hips forward, rubbing the lips of her cunt against Glauce's. The noise that tore from the girl's throat was like a wild animal snared in a trap. Medea moved against her, using one hand as leverage by placing it down on Glauce's pretty hair as it spilled across the bed. Glauce's eyes shifted sideways; she tried to lift her head from the bed, but winced as the movement pulled at her hair, forcing her to hold her head still.\n\nHer body was anything but still, though. She writhed so beautifully against Medea, her motions clumsy and inelegant as Medea reached a hand between them to help relieve the burning pleasure spreading rapidly through her whole body like a forest fire. If her thumb also brushed over a spot that made Glauce pant and cry out, then that was just fortuitous happenstance for the girl. Medea's only goal now was to chase her own pleasure, a fierce and untrammelled desire that crested inside her as she thrust her cunt against Glauce and her own hand.\n\n\"Ah, ah, please!\" Glauce cried beneath her, one hand rising to cover her face as it grew redder. Medea grabbed her by the wrist and slammed her hand flat against the bed.\n\n\"Don't hide from me,\" she growled, fast approaching her release as she continued to work her cunt against Glauce's quivering body. \"Let me see that pretty face as I ruin you.\"\n\nGlauce's muscles tensed, and then she shuddered, biting down on her lip hard enough to draw blood as she came undone. Medea drank in the expression on her face--wonder, terror, something almost divine--and then, she tumbled over her own peak, a dizzying pulse through her cunt as she stroked her fingers harder against herself through the tremors.\n\nWhen the rush of pleasure finally ebbed, she looked down at the girl she had debauched. The pollen's heat was subsiding, leaving behind exhaustion; Glauce blinked up at her through long lashes, drowsy and heavy-lidded.\n\nMedea stroked her cheek, still warm and pink from exertion.\n\n\"See?\" she murmured. \"I did make it stop. I told you I would, didn't I?\"\n\nGlauce's eyelids fluttered, closing as she slipped under the wave of her tiredness. Medea remained atop her. There was a plan forming in her mind's eye; so hard was she working to slot the pieces into place, that she didn't hear the chamber door creak open until it was too late.\n\n\"Medea!\"\n\nShe startled at that familiar voice booming loud from across the room. Jason stood in the doorway, mouth open and face pale, twisted in disgust and horror.\n\n\"Medea, what have you done?\" Jason's voice shook.\n\nMedea looked up at him from where she crouched over Glauce's limp body on the bed, their legs still tangled together. It didn't take too long for her to realise what an opportunity this was to show off her triumph over him. Her lips curved into a smile; she let it widen until she was baring her teeth at him. Beneath her, Glauce whimpered, fingers curling into fists around the bedsheets and then loosening again.\n\n\"I didn't do this to her, Jason,\" said Medea. \"You did. If you'd only left her alone...\" She shook her head, tilting her chin down to get a better view of Glauce's slack face, the dried tracks of tears down her cheeks, and the fullness of her parted lips.\n\n\"You should be grateful,\" Medea told Jason, not looking up from her contemplation of Glauce's ruin. \"My first plan was far crueller--but then, it would be such a waste to kill her. She's sweet, isn't she? I can see why your head was turned.\"\n\n\"Medea, stop this madness,\" said Jason, desperation roughening his voice, making it sound like he was about to cry. \"You've had your revenge, now leave her alone.\"\n\nMedea leapt to her feet, sweeping Glauce up in her arms. The girl's breath hitched, before she curled inwards toward Medea, burrowing her cheek into the soft wool of her cloak. Medea felt something crack open in her chest, spilling warmth inside her. She wished she had a free hand, so that she could brush a stray lock of the girl's damp, honey-brown hair off her face.\n\nIt was no matter: once she got Glauce away from the palace, she could do as she pleased. How fickle the Fates could be to a woman, showering her with misfortune then throwing gold into her lap. This morning, Medea believed she had lost everything worth living for. Now, amongst the ruins, she had found this prize, and she could see her victory looming on the far horizon.\n\nJason's outraged, wordless protest reminded her that he was still there, blocking her nearest exit. That wouldn't do: Medea needed to get out, and fast, before Creon realised she had besmirched his precious daughter's honour and had no intentions of giving her up.\n\n\"I'm leaving,\" she said to Jason, admitting no arguments. \"Just like you and Creon wanted--aren't you pleased? But I'm taking her with me. I'm sure you'll soon find another innocent young maiden to warm your bed instead.\"\n\nBefore Jason could say anything in reply, Medea raised a hand, marshalling the air around her and aiming it squarely at his chest. Jason's mouth opened in a curse as her power lifted him off his feet. He collided with the wall, his head striking the stone. He slumped to the floor, a bead or two of blood trickling from beneath his hair. Medea sniffed as she walked past him, carrying Glauce's sleeping body in her arms. She was heavy, even slender as she was, but Medea was strong enough.\n\n\"Get some rest,\" Medea said to the girl, feeling almost fond. \"You'll need it. Once we get away from here, I think you and I will have a lot of fun together.\"\n\nStealing the girl from her betrothed wasn't how she had planned to take her revenge--but, if men could go around taking whichever woman caught their eye, then why couldn't she?\n\nAfter all, Glauce made such a beautiful bride.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"47882395\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"Glauce\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Medea\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"impact\", \"Victim\": \"Jason\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Medea\"} } ```"}

Afraid of the thundering rage Lady Athena hides behind those cool eyes. \n\nAthena drops her hand, \"So be it.

{"work_id": 56755555, "full_story": "Feel the burning light - story\n\nChapter 1: History Mocks Love\n\nOlympus: Ancient Greece one year before the birth of Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta - The Muse Clio, daughter of Mnemosyne and Zeus\nClio, daughter of Memnosyne, one of the Muses of Phoebus Apollon, goddess of history and lyre playing never thought that she would come to prefer the rustic charms of Mount Helicon over beautiful, bright Olympus, home of the gods. A place of light, delight, music, and cheer. Always home to a feast, party, concert, recital, debate, discourse. All things that a muse would take pleasure in. Alas, as of recently, Olympus was home to wailing, weeping, and whining. The reason for this change was the beautiful but capricious Aphrodite. Clio repressed a snarl as she thought of that goddess. She had little fondness for the Olympians, save her half-brother and master, Apollon, but Aphrodite knew how to infuriate an impartial recorder of history. The goddess constantly complained about how petty, unreasonable, and treacherous she was portrayed in tales and tellings. Clio had a ledger recording all the times her mighty father, the Lord Zeus had reprimanded her after Aphrodite had complained. She preferred not to think of the number.\n\nAphrodite's latest pique was some mortal boy the goddess of love had been disgustingly and embarrassingly besotted with, one Adonis. Aphrodite had abandoned her dignity for him. The goddess of beauty abandoned her perfumed parlors, expensive cosmetics, exquisite jewelry, and fine chitons in exchange for rough huntress garments. Instead of attending to her duties as befitted her station, Aphrodite ran about in forests, hunting beasts! Letting her hair get tangled, her skin gain scratches, her fingers calluses, her feet blisters, and her peplos become stained and dirty! Just to please some mortal who should be delighted that a goddess was even looking at him.\n\nClio had seen the boy, her lord Apollon had enjoyed the boy for a season but even he managed to stay reasonable about the creature. Clio would admit that the boy was quite comely; she had functional eyes, and he had nothing in his face and body to be ashamed of--a curious fact, given that he was born of an unholy union between daughter and father. Clio had noted that the offspring were utterly unsightly when mortals bred too closely. Then again that distasteful union was not of the parent's own volition but incited by Aphrodite, so perhaps the boy's beauty was not such a surprise. It was most apt that Aphrodite would become enamored with the abomination she had helped create. Fallen victim to her weapon.\n\nClio thought back at how often gods far more reasonable than Aphrodite became so utterly silly about love. Clio had written excellent and exhaustive records on the phenomenon, but she needed help understanding why. She had taken more than a few lovers, godly and mortal but never was her reason and logic overcome by them. Once their physical charms wore off, Clio had no trouble ending the affair and returning to her routine, unbothered by lingering sentiments. Aphrodite was behaving a lot like her lord Apollon after that winged pest Eros had struck him with an arrow. And yet, it was due to a love god's power, and the arrow's effects wore off after a few centuries. While he still sang praises to Daphne and inspired art in her honor, it was fueled by remorse and wistful longings of what could have been. Apollon suffered a few infatuations, but they hardly ever lasted more than a few sunrises, and Apollon was never overcome with sentiment. He had been quite taken with Branchus, but that affair ended in three seasons; the boy was established as a priest and went on to marry. Apollo had blessed his bloodline without jealousy. Happy to see his pretty goatherd establish himself in the world.\n\nSimilarly, with Adonis, Apollo had enjoyed him but grew bored. He was happy to send the boy back to Aphrodite and Persephone, save for the occasional fling whenever they met and were in the mood. But Aphrodite was not reacting the same. Eros could not have struck his mother with one of his arrows, could he? The younger god could not have dared. After all, Aphrodite saved Eros from the consequences of his mischief. Whenever someone tried to take the winged love god to task, his mother would brush away their rage with a wink and a winsome smile. Or his father would do so with scowls and weapons. Eros would have strayed his hand, no matter how tempted.\n\nClio shook her head to clear such thoughts and focused on her lyre, trying to play a soothing melody to induce some calm in her surroundings. Her skilled fingers caressed the strings of her golden lyre, a gift from her lord Apollon. As she played, a few gods and nymphs were drawn close to her to better hear her music and share her peace and serenity. Clio reveled in the gentle sway of the bodies as her melody overcame them. She proceeded with the song, intending to draw it out before finishing the piece.\n\n\"Oh, my beloved!\" Wailed Aphrodite with very loud sobs.\n\nClio's concentration broke, her fingers spasming in rage and snapping three strings of her lyre. Embarrassed and furious she threw the instrument in the ground.\n\n\"Will you stop wailing already?! He was mortal! You knew that he would die sooner or later! If you truly are so upset about his death then why are you bedding Ares when the boy's body is not even cold yet!\"\n\nEveryone froze in utter horror before madly scrambling away from Clio. Aphrodite's glorious body glowed with divine light before gathering a handful of pink energy in her palms. With a snarl of rage, she flung it at Clio. The sphere of ping energy struck the muse right in the chest. Apollon tried to hurry over but was prevented by the fleeing onlookers.\n\n\"You piddling, insignificant little muse. How dare you doubt my love for my beloved Adonis! How dare you say that I do not mourn him!\"\n\nClio sneered.\n\n\"Ares, father of most of your children and the man most often found in your bed, the same god that slew the boy you claim to mourn so much, has been seen leaving your bed chamber on several occasions since the death. How sincere can your mourning be?\"\nAphrodite glowed with so much rage that the nymphs that had not fled perished from being exposed to her wrathful divinity. Aphrodite gave Clio a smile that oddly reminded her of a shark barring its deadly teeth.\n\n\"You will know what it is to lose someone that you love. You will love someone with all your heart. He shall perish and you shall weep. You shall weep, beseech for him to be returned to you but your tears shall be in vain. You will lose the person that you truly love, and you will understand what love is!\"\n\nApollon shoved some of the fleeing minor gods out of his path and stopped before the two goddesses.\n\n\"Aphrodite! Rescind your curse now!\"\n\nThe Goddess of Love turned to him, a sneer marring her perfect lips.\n\n\"May the love of your life bleed out and die in your arms!\"\n\nShe threw another sphere of pink energy and left in a flash of rosy light.\n\nApollon glared at the space where the goddess had stood before grabbing his muse from her upper arm and dragging her to a private corner of the garden.\n\n\"What is the matter with you Clio?\" He furiously whispered at her.\n\"My apologies my lord. She exhausted my patience.\"\n\nApollo sighed.\n\n\"If a member of the council is being tiresome then leave. Do not get into an argument. Especially not that accursed love goddess and her monster of a son.\"\n\nClio nodded in tired acceptance. Apollo ordered her to go to her palace and lay low for a while. Apollo stared into the distance, eyes unfocused as myriad futures and threads flashed before his eyes. This did not bode well. He removed the golden laurel from his hair with the usual twinge of guilt. That obsessive, burning longing had thankfully faded. But he did remember how he felt under the effects of that arrow. It might be safer to send Clio into the mortal world for a short while. He could not send her to Delphi, Mount Helicon, or Mount Parnassus but somewhere where no one would expect a muse. Maybe Sparta. That warlike kingdom had been very effusive to Apollo lately; they were even devoting that delightful Karneia festival to him! He would send Clio there until Aphrodite found herself a new toy to play with.\n\nThe next day Clio left Olympus, her departure was noticed by a few in the retinue of Aphrodite. They hurried to inform their lady. A cruel smile curled the moist, plump, rosy lips of the goddess of love. Aphrodite gestured for her handmirror to a wisely terrified nymph. Trembling the girl handed it to her. Aphrodite tapped the flawless surface and it showed her a handsome, muscular young king. Amyclas of Sparta. She sighed lustfully at the oiled tanned skin stretching over taunt muscles. This one could almost put her Ares to shame. Reminding her godly lover made the goddess scowl despite what Clio and others thought; Aphrodite had banned Ares from her bed since Adonis' death while inflicting him with scorching desire. She would only take him back after Ares had suffered enough to her liking once he truly regretted his actions and sincerely begged her for forgiveness.\n\nClio really ought to be grateful, Aphrodite could have chosen a hideous old man instead of such a fine male specimen. His pedigree was impeccable too, born to a demigod son of Zeus and the heiress of Laconia, the beautiful Queen Sparta. Now to push them toward each other and the Fates would take care of the rest. Apollo had already done some of the work for her by sending Clio to Sparta.\n\nEros observed Aphrodite's work while leaning against the wall of his mother's parlor--a sly smirk on his face, feathered wings swaying delicately and silently. Everyone was focused on the curse placed on Clio, and they had not caught on to the fact that his mother also cursed Apollo. The arrogant golden god was to lose the love of his life. Eros could not wait to see it unfold. Apollo deserved all the suffering that love can bring for having dared to insult him.\n\nThe divine assembly was in progress in Mount Olympus's grand hall. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, had just cursed Clio, the Muse of history, to suffer the loss of the only person she would truly love. The hall was silent, the air heavy with the weight of Aphrodite's words. The wiser inhabitants of Olympus were making themselves scarce to avoid getting caught in the crossfire.\n\nIn the corner, shrouded in shadows, the three sisters known as the Moirais, the goddesses of fate, observed the scene--Clotho, who spins the thread of life; Lachesis, who measures it; and Atropos, who cuts it, were privy to the destinies of gods and mortals alike.\n\nAs Aphrodite's curse echoed through Olympus, a ripple of laughter emerged from the dark and shadowed corner. The Moirai found the scene amusing. Clotho, her hands still busy spinning the threads of life, chuckled.\n\n\"Oh, the irony! The goddess of love, herself a victim of love's torment, now curses another to share her fate.\"\n\nLachesis, measuring a thread, added with a smirk,\n\n\"And Clio, who has always been an observer of history, will now become a part of it. A love story of the ages, don't you think? But now, what Aphrodite intends. No, that would be boring.\"\n\nAtropos, her shears glinting ominously, laughed.\n\n\"Indeed, sisters. But let's not forget, it is we who hold the scissors.\"\n\nTheir laughter filled the hall, a chilling reminder of their ultimate power over the destinies of gods and mortals. The Moirai's attendants could only watch in silence, the gravity of the situation sinking in.\n\nClotho picks a beautiful blue-green thread mottled with gold.\nLachesis took out her rod and measured a short length.\nAtropos readied her shears, a cruel smile on her weathered, ancient face.\n\n\"This little hero shall live thrice sisters. The first time the disc shall strike him. Flower shall fall in blood. The second time his wings will burn. Bird shall fall from the light. That leaves the third time. What will be the hero's downfall? Shall the pearl fall into darkness? Will the hero's string once more be cut to dust or shall the hero become gold and deathless? So many choices!\n\n\"That spoiled daughter of Ouranos will not be happy. She expects the one that the daughter of Memnosyne will truly love to be the handsome king, not the beautiful prince she shall bear.\"\n\"She needs to learn that romantic love is not all that there is. Maternal love is what almost destroyed this world.\"\n\"Aphrodite shall not learn that lesson easily.\"\n\"True, but she will cause such delightful tragedies as she slowly learns.\"\n\"If she ever does.\"\n\n \n\nAncient Greece: Athens, a few years before the birth of Icarus - Daedalus, Son of Prince Metion and Athena\n\nIn the bustling city of Athens, the renowned inventor and scholar Daedalus was hard at work in his workshop, surrounded by blueprints and half-finished inventions. His concentration was broken by a loud, arrogant young voice.\n\n\"Uncle, it seems that you've lost your touch,\" sneered Talos, his nephew.\n\nTalos was a promising young inventor himself, but his arrogance often overshadowed his talent.\n\nDaedalus looked up from his work silently praying for patience, his eyes meeting the smug expression on Talos' face.\n\n\"And what makes you say that, Talos?\" he asked, his voice steady.\n\nTalos gestured around the workshop, his eyes gleaming with mockery.\n\n\"This place, Uncle. It's filled with unfinished projects and failed inventions. It's clear you're no longer the best.\"\n\nDaedalus repressed a snarl, carefully keeping his expression neutral, not wanting to let the brat know that his words had hit a sore spot. Best to be calm and wise. How he hated the word wise. He looked at his nephew, his gaze steady.\n\"Talos, success isn't measured by the number of completed projects but by the knowledge gained from each attempt. Remember, even failures are stepping stones to success.\"\n\nTalos scoffed, turning to leave.\n\n\"Well, Uncle, you've become quite the philosopher. But remember, in the end, it is the results that matter.\"\n\nDaedalus smiled at his nephew. As arrogant as the whelp was, he was insecure. He was only mortal, with a few distant drops of divinity in him. No whisper of a chance of ever going to Chiron's training camp as he was desperate to do so.\n\n\"Indeed, but results do not come on the first try. Perseverance and trial and error streamline a working. Something I learned from the renowned trainer of demigods Chiron and my own holy mother.\"\n\nHis words found target, the boy scowled, scoffed and left with the tail between his legs.\n\nDaedalus gritted his teeth as he endured the little brat that his loathed stepmother and half-sister had foisted upon him. It took him years to save enough drachma to set up his household and finally get out of the tartaric pit that his loving, wise mother condemned him. His accursed stepmother never missed a chance to remind him that he was an interloper and a blight on her home. And yet, when he finally managed to leave she foisted her revolting grandson upon him? When Daedalus was a child, she did everything to ensure that his half-siblings hated him so he would have no ties or bonds with her family. But now she wanted him to teach her grandson? Most likely the brat was there to learn his secrets and steal his inventions and research.\n\nDaedalus was no fool, he bid his slaves to follow the boy around every minute and kept all his notes locked up in several chests in his workroom. It was quite tiresome having to set up every day, but needs must. He would not be robbed of his hard work, not by a grand spawn of his stepmother.\n\nHe tried to avoid the brat as much as he could by assigning extensive readings and intellectual exercises to keep him busy. Unfortunately, Talos was not kept busy enough. Daedalus had the misfortune of encountering the boy in the busy main agora of Athens. There, Talos stood tall, a newly invented saw in his hands. The crowd around him was buzzing with anticipation. Daedalus, stopped at the edge of the crowd, trying to watch quietly and unnoticed.\n\n\"Behold!\" Talos exclaimed, holding up the saw for everyone to see.\n\n\"This, my friends, is the future of craftsmanship!\"\n\nThe crowd murmured in awe, making Talos preen, their eyes fixed on the gleaming saw. Talos turned to Daedalus, a smug smile on his face.\n\n\"Uncle, your ship sails may have once been the pride of Athens, but they will soon be overshadowed.\"\n\nDaedalus repressed the urge to grab one of his daggers and hurl it at the brat. He could do a one-kill shot. Chiron had him practice more than enough to use against monsters. Even if it had been years since Daedalus had participated in combat his skills could not have rusted. He was in public and he had an image to uphold.\n\nDaedalus raised an eyebrow, crossing his arms over his chest, the very picture of nonchalance.\n\n\"And why is that, Talos?\" He asked, feeling proud of how calm his voice sounded.\n\nTalos gestured to the saw in his hands. Daedalus observed the contraption. Very similar to the mandibles and teeth of certain reptiles. He briefly regretted giving the brat those precious scrolls from Egypt.\n\"With this, we can build faster and more efficiently. Your sails are a thing of the past.\"\n\nThe crowd gasped, turning their eyes to Daedalus, waiting for his response. Daedalus simply smiled, not allowing his hackles to rise and become a spectacle for everyone to mock, keeping his steady gaze upon his ungrateful brat of a nephew.\n\n\"Innovation is indeed commendable, Talos. But remember, a tool is only as good as the craftsman who wields it.\"\n\nWith that little pearl of wisdom delivered in a deliberately patient tone, as if speaking to a very small child, Daedalus turned and walked away, leaving Talos amid the silent crowd. As the murmurs started again, Talos couldn't help but feel a pang of doubt. His saw was innovative, but Daedalus' words struck a chord. After all, it wasn't the tool but the skill and wisdom of the craftsman that truly mattered. Talos had borrowed his uncle's sculpting tools, but his statues never matched Daedalus's. Talos' sculptures were good, but no one would ever mistake them for living creatures like they did with his uncle's sculptures. He had to step up his game to make his mother and grandmother proud. Far too long had they suffered as Daedalus' name grew and that of his full uncles faded.\n\nA few days later, Talos once more barged into his uncle's workshop. Again, the boy started boasting about his latest invention. Daedalus, his uncle, was trying to concentrate on his work, but Talos' loud voice was making it impossible.\n\n\"Uncle, you should see this!\" Talos exclaimed, holding up a piece of wood that had been cut with his new saw.\n\n\"Look at the precision, the finesse! Your old tools could never achieve this!\"\n\nDaedalus sighed, putting down his chisel. Time to be the magnanimous uncle and dispense more pearls of wisdom. It was getting harder as of late, terrible dreams kept him awake at night and Talos constantly needled him during the day. His reservoirs of patience were quickly drying ups.\n\" Talos, there is more to craftsmanship than just cutting wood,\" he said, trying to keep his voice calm.\n\nBut Talos was not in the mood to listen. He was too caught up in his own excitement, glad to finally have one over his uncle.\n\n\"No, uncle, you're just jealous because my inventions will outshine your outdated methods! I will replace you and you will be nothing!\"\n\nThis was the last straw for Daedalus. He felt a surge of anger rise within him. He had always tried to be patient with Talos, tolerating his arrogance for the sake of his reputation. But this blatant and utter disrespect was too much! Without thinking, Daedalus picked up a heavy mallet from the floor and swung it at Talos, who had gotten far to close. The blow landed on Talos' head, and he collapsed on the floor, lifeless.\n\nThe workshop felt utterly silent. Daedalus stood there for a long time, mallet in hand, looking at his nephew's lifeless body. He had let his anger get the best of him, and it had led to a terrible consequence. Daedalus needed to think of a way to do damage control so his life was not ruined by this. He had to think fast and act quickly. There were no witnesses, if he could discreetly dispose of the body Daedalus could get away with this and resume his normal life.\n\nTo Daedalus' dismay a divine figure matterialized in his workshop, his godly mother Athena, goddess of wisdom and warfare. She stoo before her demigod son, her eyes filled with disappointment and anger.\n\n\"Daedalus,\" she began, her voice echoing in the silent room.\n\n\"I have watched over you, admired your creativity and ingenuity. But what have you done... it is unforgivable.\"\n\n\"Talos was your family, Daedalus, your nephew. Blood crimes are abominable in the eyes of the gods.\"\n\nDaedalus, still in shock from his thoughtless actions, could only stare at his godly mother. He had never seen her so furious. He knew that he had done wrong, but he had been wronged too. Daedalus had been wronged from the moment his godly mother, in all her wisdom thought it fit to drop him in Metion's volatile and tense household as yet another kindling in the fire. Athena continued to lecture her son, unaware of his thoughts.\n\n\"Talos looked up to you, admired you. And yet, you let your anger and jealously get the best of you.\"\n\nDaedalus had enough. His mother knew nothing of what he had gone through since he was a child.\n\n\"He did not look up to me mother! He despised and loathed me just like his grandmother and his mother! If you had opened your eyes once during my life you would know! I do no regret what I did! The awful brat had it coming! You don't know anything about me because you are not a real mother!\"\n\nVery unwise to speak such to such a prideful goddess but Daedalus had bitten his tongue far too often. Athena's eyes gleamed with anger. She vanished but one of the slaves walked in the workshop, seeming her master clutching a mallet and the master's nephew laying dead on the floor she screamed loudly, bringing more people in.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\nA still furious Athena watched the trial of Daedalus from Olympus still simmering with rage from her son's utter gall. She had made him, given him everything he had and yet he dared to embarrass her by committing a blood crime and humiliate her by speaking back! Hermes, that rotten gossip had spied on the argument she had with Daedalus and had spread it all over Olympus. She had vaporised five nymphs she had caught gossiping but it did nothing to quell her rage. She would need to punish Daedalus severely. Taking inspiration from the name of Talos' mother she had marked Daedalus with a partridge tattoo in his collarbone to mark him as a kinslayer. Noticing as Perdix, the mother of the slain Talos shrieked at her half brother a new plan brewed in Athena's strategic mind.\n\nDaedalus had deprived his sister of her child, wounding the woman deeply. Athena had heard the royal lady's sobs of grief from her altars. Perdix had spared no expense in sacrificing fat cattle to Athena, beeseeching the goddess to punish Daedalus. While Athena was reasonable and only saw her children as tools to use and pieces to place on a gameboard, she knew that others did not do so. Her siblings tended to raise a fuss everytime their children were wronged or when they died. Even Apollo, who as god of logic should know better. Mortals had short lives anyway, why bother developing a sentiment when in a blink they would be gone.\n\nDaedalus was mortal, he had inherited cleverness, ingenuity and craftsmanship from her but he had always been somewhat impulsive, prone to attachments If Daedalus had a child, he would love that child fiercely and suffer horribly if he were to lose said child. Athena tapped her fingers agains the arm of her chair. The flaw in that plan was the utter lack of interest that Daedalus had shown in taking a wife or even a lover. She would need the assistance of a love god to ensure that Daedalus had at least one child. Aphrodite was out of the question, the goddess would demand too much for her assistance. The erotes were minor gods, with limited domains and unlikely to be effective. That left Eros, who was quite in debt to her father Zeus from the whole Psyche debacle. Smiling to herself Athena left to visit her father.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nAthens, The Trial of Daedalus\n\nIn the grand hall of the royal palace of Athens, the air was thick with tension. Metion, father of Daedalus looked at his once glorious son with acute disappointment. His wife, Alcippe scowled openly at her stepson with seething hate as she consoled her sobing daughter Perdix. Daedalus stood before the assembly, his head held high despite the heavy chains that bound him. The murmurs of the crowd fell silent as King Aegeus rose from his throne.\n\n\"Daedalus,\" the king began, his voice echoing through the hall.\n\n\"You stand accused of the murder of Talos, a crime most heinous. A blood crime. What do you say in your defense?\"\n\nThe first thought in Daedalus' mind was that the brat had it coming and that it was the fault of his own scheming mother and grandmother for inflicting him upon Daedalus. The inventor might not be wise, but he was clever. This was not what a horrified crowd wanted to hear. They wanted someone remorseful and contrite, eager to seek redemption. Daedalus willed some tears in his eyes and lowered his head in pretend shame and sadness.\n\n\"I am guilty, my lord,\" Daedalus replied, his voice sounding remorseful.\n\n\"I had a moment of madness. I let my anger cloud my judgement. I am ready to accept my punishment.\"\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd at his admission, most onlookers looked at him with pity. King Aegeus nodded solemnly.\n\n\"Very well, Daedalus. For your crime, I hereby sentence you to exile for thirty years. You are to leave and not return until your sentence is finished. Should you still be alive after thirty years have passed you will be permitted to set foot in Athens.\"\n\n\"Where am I to go, my lor?\" Daedalus asked, his voice barely above a whisper. Thirty years of exile were harsh but still much better than execution. Still, it depended on the place of exile.\n\n\"To Crete,\" King Aegeus declared.\n\n\"You will serve King Minos and use your skills for the benefit of his kingdom. This is your punishment, Daedalus. May the gods have mercy on your soul.\"\n\nDaedalus knew that at least one goddess would not. The curse mark she had placed upon his collarbone, his half sister's feathered namesake itched on cue.\n\nThe king's words echoed in the hall, prompting more murmuring from the crowd. Perdix started to shriek, demanding that her brother be executed, her mother adding her voice to her protests. King Aegeus shot a scornful glance at Metion.\n\n\"Prince Metion, control your women! I allowed them here out of courtesy to you but they were to stay silent!\"\n\nDaedalus heard the echo of a hand hitting skin but was unable to see which harpy was disciplined. He was led away, his future now laying across the sea in the land of Crete.\n\n \n\nModern Era, A Hospital in Montauk, the birth of Percy Jackson\n\nIn a brightly lit delivery room in small hospital in Montauk, Sally Jackson was in the throes of labor. The air was thick with her anticipation and fear. She was bleeding far too much, to the distress of the doctors. As the contractions grew stronger, so did the storm outside. Rain lashed agains the windows, shaking them, and thunder echoed through the night.\n\nWith one final push, Sally gave birth to her baby. She named the baby Perseus, Percy for short. A name she had carefully chosen over many others, in the hope of obtaining the luck of the original for her baby. As the baby let out the first cry, a sudden earthquake shook the room, rattling the windows and causing the lights to flicker. The doctors were alarmed, hurrying the mother and child to a different room. Sally paid no mind to the storm or earth tremors, too enamoured with her beautiful child.\nFar away from the mortal world, in the Underworld,, Hades felt the tremor. His obsidian black eyes narrowed in suspicion as he sensed the powerful energy that had caused it.\n\n\"What on earth...\" he muttered, raising from his throne, drawing a look of concern from his beloved queen. He nodded fondly to her.\n\n\"I need to investigate something my love. I will be back to you shortly.\"\n\nPersephone smiled at her husband and king.\n\n\"Of course my love, I will be waiting.\"\n\nFor once she would wait for him rather than the other way around. He waited for her for months and seasons. She could wait for a few short hours. Hades pressed a tender kiss on her pale brow. Summoning a shadow, he traveled to the mortal world, appearing in an alley near the hospital. He could feel the residual energy in the air, a powerful mix of the sea and storm.\n\n\"Poseidon,\" he hissed, recognizing his less despised brother' signature. Poseidon had broken the oath just like Zeus. Of course Zeus had noticed nothing. Hades could sense his youngest and most despised brother in Olympus, in a rather merry mood.\n\nCuriosity piqued, Hades put on his Helm of Darkness and made his way to the hospital. He watched from the shadows as Sally cradled her newborn baby, a look of pure, fierce maternal love on her lovely face. Maria's beloved face interposed over his brother's lover. Despite himself, Hades felt a pang of sympathy for the mortal woman whose only fault was to fall for a god's charms and her demigod child, born against a sacred oath.\n\nSally placed her child on the provided crib and fell into a deep, exhausted sleep, unaware of her godly visitor. Even clear sight could not pierce through the Helm of Darkness. Hades approached the crib. He snapped his fingers, ensuring that the mortal woman would not wake from her slumber. He removed his Helm and picked up the child. The baby's eyes snapped open, much to Hades' shock. The child had Poseidon's brilliant emeral eyes, their mother's eyes. Hades held the infant more securely as he gazed down at those eyes. This child was on the third life. He could sense two violent deaths and two stays in Elysium. Looking deeper in the soul he suddenly knew who this infant has been. His sunny's nephew's favorite lover. The same lover whose rebirth had been put indefinitely on hold. Whispering a blessing to ensure that no monsters bound to him bothered the child without Hades's say so he returned the baby in the crib. His son Zagreus, the god of rebirth had quite a few things to explain.\n\nWith a final glance at mother an child, Hades put his Helmet back on and disappeared back into the shadows, returning to the Underworld. He knew that the fates had just spun an interesting thread into the tapestry of life, one that would undoubtedly cause a stir on Olympus. He smirked as he imagined Zeus panicking at the prophecy being put in motion and decided to only keep watch for now. After all the prophecy said that Olympus was in danger of being razed, not the Underworld. And if Olympus was razed, Hades could keep his wife with him always, never again needing to give her up to her mother at the start of spring.\n\nIn the quiet hours of the night, when the hospital was hushed and the storm had subsided, a figure appeared in Sally Jackson's room. He was tall and regal, with brilliant emerald green eyes that mirrored the newborn in the crib.\n\n\"Poseidon,\" Sally whispered, recognizing the god of the sea. She was not afraid, but rather, she felt a strange sense of calm wash over her.\n\nPoseidon nodded, his gaze softening as he looked at the sleeping baby.\n\n\"He is strong, like the sea,\" He said, his voice as deep and soothing as the ocean waves.\n\"He will do great things.\"\n\nSally smiled at Poseidon.\n\n\"She definitely is and she definitely will.\" Her voice was teasing.\nPoseidon's jaw dropped in astonishment.\n\n\"A daughter? I have a demigod daughter?\"\n\nSally raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"You never had one before?\"\n\nThe god of the sea approached the crib and picked up his infant daughter.\n\n\"I have several immortal daughters and a lot more nymph daughters but all of my demigods so far have been sons.\" He smiled at the baby.\n\n\"You are one of a kind my little one.\"\n\nAt the sound of his voice the baby's eyes eyes opened and he marvelled at eyes identical to him.\n\n\"Do not call her Perseis. I know that you are partial to the name and good fortune of my nephew Perseus, but there is an Oceanid Perseis. She not only was my father's favourite niece but she also wronged my immortal daughter.\"\n\nSally shook her head.\n\n\"Her name will still be Perseus, I will call her Percy for short. If boys can be named after your huntress niece, a girl can be named after your hero nephew.\"\n\nPoseidon gave his lover an odd look.\n\n\"There is a boy named Artemis?\"\n\nSally laughed.\n\n\"A fictional boy. A twelve year old boy genius.\" She fell silent as he murmured a blessing and placed their daughter back in her crib.\nSally rose from the bed and looked down at Percy, her heart swelling with love and fear for her child..\n\n\"Will you protect her?\" she asked, meeting Poseidon's gaze.\n\nPoseidon was silent for a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"As much as I can, Sally. But she is a demigod. Her path will not be easy. I have slightly more leeway with a daughter than I would with a son.\"\n\nWith a final glance at Percy, Poseidon disappeared, leaving Sally alone with her daughter. She knew that her life would never be the same, but she also knew that she would do everything in her power to protect Percy, just as Poseidon had promised.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nThe Underworld was as cold and desolate as ever, the River Styx flowing with an eerie silence. Apollo, the god of the sun, felt out of place in the darkness, but he had a mission.\n\n\"Hades,\" Apollo called out, his voice echoing through the cavernous expanse of Hades' throne room. The god of the Underworld appeared, his dark robes blending with the shadows.\n\n\"Apollo,\" Hades greeted, his voice as cold as the realm he ruled.\n\"To what do I owe this ... unexpected visit?\"\n\n\"I seek knowledge, Hades,\" Apollo said, his gaze unwavering.\n\n\"I wish to know who Hyacinthus has been reborn as.\"\n\nHades' eyes flickered, the only sign of his surprise. He knew the truth - that Hyacinthus, Apollo's beloved had been reborn as Percy Jackson, daughter of Poseidon. But he also knew the chaos that would ensue if this information was revealed. Apollo would undoubtedly abscond with the infant. Her mother would certainly pray to her godly lover, and Poseidon would start a war to get his daughter back, not caring for the massive influx of souls in the underworld, multiplying Hades' workload exponentially.\n\nHyacinthus had been reborn as Icarus before. Once again, he had died, leaving Apollo heartbroken. Apollo's heartbreak had affected his domains, which eventually caused the decline of civilization, specifically the collapse of what the mortal called the Late Bronze Age. The massive death toll and increased workload from that was what prompted Hades to put the soul's rebirth on hold. He did not want to deal with the consequences of yet another tragedy involving Apollo.\n\n\"Why do you want to know?\" Hades asked, stalling for time.\n\n\"Hyacinthus is the love of my life,\" Apollo replied, his voice filled with a desperate longing that almost made Hades stagger back.\n\n\"I wish to see him again, keep him safe, and make him immortal so I can share eternity with him. What I always wanted, but I was twice denied.\"\n\nHades was silent for a stretch of time, carefully considering his options. Finally he shook his head.\n\n\"I'm afraid I cannot help you, Apollo. The Fates have woven their threads, and interfering is not our place. You know what happened last time you tried to interfere. I saw Icarus's memories. The Fates blackmailed him. They threatened to throw you in Tartarus for your defiance if he did not kill himself with those wings. If you try to thwart them, it will not be you who pays the price.\"\n\nApollo flinched as he was reminded of the true reason Icarus died. He looked at Hades, disappointment clear in his eyes. But he nodded, understanding the rules that bound them.\n\nHades stopped the sun god from leaving.\n\n\"How do you, a god with no domains in the underworld, know that a specific soul has been reborn?\"\n\nApollo paused before answering.\n\n\"After I recovered Icarus' body, I took him to Delos and transformed him into a tree. Your queen owed me a favour. She agreed to create a connection between the tree and the soul in the underworld. A few months back demigod essence manifested in the tree. Hyacinthus has once more been reborn.\"\n\nHades resisted the urge to slap Apollo. The nerve of him! To make his wife do such a thing.\n\n\"Why did Persephone owe you a favor?\" Hades bit out, beyond annoyed.\n\nApollo just smiled sadly.\n\n\"I swore on the Styx that I would keep it a secret. If you want to know, you will have to ask Persephone.\"\n\nWith that, Apollo left the Underworld, his heart heavy with disappointment. Hades watched him go, and the secret of Hyacinthus's rebirth was safe for now. He walked to the banks of the Styx, mentally summoning the goddess of oaths and hatred. The eldest Oceanid appeared to him in all her dark glory.\n\n\"I cannot tell you what that oath was.\"\n\n\"I know.\" The God of the Underworld told his subordinate.\n\n\"When Thalia Grace was born you sent quite a few monsters after her but you have not done the same for the Percy Jackson. Why?\"\n\nStyx raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"I am unable to do so. The day after that child of the broken oath was born, Poseidon descended here and drank from my waters to atone for his misdeed.\" Styx admitted.\n\n\"It is not like you to be quite that lenient my dear.\" Hades pried.\n\n\"What did you do to the child?\"\n\nStyx gave her lord a cold, cruel smile, her eyes glimering with the hate that was her domain.\n\n\"Her father broke an oath. An oath not to have children.\" Her piece said Styx dove back into her dark waters.\n\nHades paused by the banks, pondering back on Apollo's words. The sun god had told him that the tree that was Icarus had gathered Perseus Jackson's demigod essence. After Hyacinthus had died, Apollo used the demigod essence lingering in the first hyacinth flower to create Asclepius. Of course, he had to plant the embryo in some woman's womb, but Asclepius was still Hyacinthus's son. Just like Theseus had been created from Poseidon, mingling his essence with that of King Aegeus and planted it in Aethra's womb. Aethra had been far smarter and more pragmatic than Princess Coronis, not that it has spared her from paying the price of Theseus' folly.\n\nHyacinthus is born.\n\nIcarus is born.\n\nPoseidon and Hades have a chat.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nTale of Hyacinthus:\n\nClio's attachment to King Amyclas faded when her belly swelled with his child. When her mind was finally clear, the muse cursed Aphrodite. Despite their dalliance being caused by love magic, Clio was fond of King Amyclas; he was very handsome, clever, well-learned, and dutiful. Everything a muse could appreciate. When Aphrodite's curse struck him, Clio would note his passing with sorrow. Clio returned to Olympus, having had quite enough of Sparta. She did bid goodbye to her lover and was gracious as he wept at her feet, patting his thick dark curls and murmuring some consoling nonsense she had observed Apollo utter whenever he took leave of his besotted lovers. Eventually, King Amyclas remembered that he was indeed a king and thus must maintain his dignity. They said more dignified goodbyes, with Amyclas promising to raise yet another temple to Apollo with shrines for her, her sister muses, and their mother. Clio informed him of her pregnancy and promised to keep him updated on the resulting child. That almost made the Spartan king weep again, but thankfully he restrained himself. Clio mounted her chariot and allowed the blessed swans of Apollo to carry her back to Olympus, her rightful abode.\n\nAt Olympus, she was greeted by her muse sisters and her lord. Apollo's eyes immediately went to her midsection. Of course, he was the god of healing, among many other domains.\n\n\"Congratulations,\" He told her with a bright smile, but his eyes were worried.\n\nClio smiled back, patting her slightly swollen belly.\n\n\"The child's father?\" Inquired Apollo.\n\n\"The King of Sparta, Amyclas,\" Clio informed him.\n\nApollo frowned, eyes unfocused as if seeing visions of the future.\n\n\"And her curse?\" He hinted at what had happened mere seasons earlier.\n\"I don't know. I became unusually infatuated with him, but it has faded completely today. Now, I am not any more fond of him than I am of my previous lovers.\"\nClio had always made it a policy to be kind and generous toward her lovers unless they wronged her. However, she preferred to leave sentiment out of it.\n\nApollo paused to ponder this new information.\n\n\"You might just be immune to love's agonies. My beloved twin and our chaste aunt are, after all. You have always been the most logical and rational of your sisters. Perhaps you are fortunate.\"\n\nClio had to ponder that. She fervently wished it was so.\n\n\"I have sworn no oaths of maidenhood.\"\n\nApollo had no answer for that.\n\n\"Let us not worry; it is unhealthy for your child anyway. When fate strikes King Amyclas, I will console you if needed.\"\n\nApollo eyed her belly again.\n\n\"I hope fate strays its hand until the child has been birthed and recognized by the father. A fatherless demigod will have little standing. It will be far more proper and fitting for your dignity if your child is recognized as a royal.\"\n\nClio had to admit that her lord's logic was sound. Amyclas had been quite taken with the idea of a demigod son.\n\n\" Let us go seek Artemis. You will need her soon enough.\" Apollo ushered her toward the shining eternal city but he was soon intercepted by Hermes, who shot a knowing smirk at Clio. Apollo shot her an apologietic glance and followed their brother.\n\nClio was deeply relieved that Artemis held the domain of childbirth as the divine patroness of midwives. Eileithyia was Hera's loyal daughter, and Hera had no love for any of her husband's bastards. It is better to have Artemis assisting in a birthing of any descendant of Zeus that was also not a descendant of Hera. The tales of what Eileithyia had done to Leto had caused the original goddess of childbirth to lose worshippers.Eileithyia was still honored, still important, but Artemis had eclipsed her. Clio knew that it had been the instigation of Apollo. Her lord was inventive in his wrath and wielded word and song akin to weapons. Deciding to heed his advice Clio made her way to Artemis' palace.\n\nThe maiden huntress was in the gardens, and several of her immortal companions were with her. Artemis was perched on a rock, watching her hunting dogs frolic in the grass. Her silver bow was lying on the ground by her feet. She idly inspected her quiver full of arrows. Today, Artemis favored her older form, one that could pass as almost older than Apollo's preferred guise. The goddess sensed Clio's approach, and her cold, silvery eyes aimed right at Clio's midsection. Artemis frowned, sighing with slight displeasure.\n\"I thought that you had better sense than to get yourself with child, even if you do not have enough sense to avoid the company of men altogether.\" Artemis challenged her brother's muse.\n\nClio arched an eyebrow.\n\n\"I never swore any vows of maidenhood, dear half-sister. To each their own. I find no quarrel with your choice to remain a maiden for eternity and I hope that you will grant me the same grace in respecting my own choices.\"\n\n\"I heard of the trouble you had with Aphrodite. How much was it your choice?\"\n\nClio pondered this.\n\n\"Knowing how vicious she is, I would have expected her to steer me to a hideous, disgusting creature. Not the most handsome king in the Peloponnese.\"\n\nAmyclas was no different from the usual man she chose to bed, even without Aphrodite's meddling. Clio liked handsome warriors; they always had the most fascinating stories to tell her. Even the ones that embellished were amusing. Amusing to punish for the hubris of rewriting history in her presence. Amyclas had done no such thing. He had enough distinguished accomplishments that he needed not to invent any. He had defeated any enemy to come his way and had expanded his kingdom, even building a new settlement, Amyclae. Apollo would say that naming a new city after himself was too much pride for a mortal, but Clio felt that Amyclas had earned it. Besides, Apollo could not complain much. Amyclae was home to an extensive sanctuary dedicated to her lord.\n\n\"Can I count on your help when my child is born?\" Clio asked, eager to hear Artemis' response.\n\nMonths later, in the heart of Mount Helion, where the sacred waters of the Hippocrene spring flowed, Clio found herself in the throes of labour. The air was thick with anticipation, the usually melodious woods hushed in reverence. By Clio's side was Artemis, assisting her as promised, her presence a comforting beacon amidst the pain. Artemis was a pillar of strength with her serene face and steady hands. Childbirth was the worst trial of Clio's immortal life.\n\nArtemis spoke, her voice echoing through the silent palace,\n\n\"Breathe, Clio. With each breath, you bring life closer.\"\n\nClio nodded, her face etched with determination. As the contractions grew stronger, Artemis never left her side. She whispered words of encouragement, her hands expertly guiding the process. The goddess' touch was surprisingly gentle, belying the strength that could bring down the mightiest of beasts.\n\nAnd then, with a final push, a cry pierced the silence of the hall, Clio's son was born. Artemis, with a soft smile, placed the child in Clio's arms. The Muse looked down at her son, her heart swelling with an indescribable love.\n\nThe demigod, even as a newborn, had the radiance of a sun-kissed flower. His eyes, bright and curious, were a lovely shade of purple, much like Clio's own, inherited from her own mother, the Titaness Memnosyne.\n\n\"I will name him Hyacinthus.\" Clio told Artemis as the goddess guided the attending nymphs to wipe off the afterbirth from Clio's body.\n\n\"Rain blossom?\" Artemis peered at the baby.\n\n\"It fits him.\" the Muse smiled as she stroked her baby's soft cheek.\n\nAs Clio held Hyacinthus close and fed him from her breast, the woods breathed a sigh of relief. The trees swayed gently, and the waters of the Hippocrene spring gurgled happily, and the creatures of the woods stirred. It was as if nature itself was celebrating the birth of Hyacinthus. Clio's precise and analytical mind was at work planning her son's upbringing. She would have so much to do.\n\nUnfortunately for Clio, someone was watching her from Olympus. Hight in the clouds, Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, daughter of Zeus and Hera, paced restlessly. Her usually calm face was marred by a frown, her heart filled with a sense of betrayal.\n\n\"Why would Clio choose Artemis over me? Eileithyia muttered to herself, her voice echoing through her private quarters.\n\nUnable to contain her frustration, she sought out Hera, her mother and the queen of the gods. Her mother would certainly know how to resolve this issue; this insult was flung at Eileithyia by someone who was supposed to be an impartial recorder of history. Clio would know that Eileithyia was older than Artemis far more seasoned in childbirth. And yet, Clio still chose Artemis, the goddess who had usurped Eileithyia not only in her domain but also in her father's affections.\nEileithyia found Hera in her chambers; her attention focused on the mortal world below. She was likely trying to catch her kingly husband at yet another adulterous tryst. Such questions were not to be spoken to Hera. As vigilant as she was to her husband's infidelities, she was loathe to hear it discussed by others.\n\n\"Mother,\" she began, her voice trembling with suppressed anger.\n\n\"Why would Clio choose Artemis to assist her in childbirth? Have I not aided countless mortals and immortals alike?\"\n\nHera turned her gaze from the mortal world to Eileithyia. She studied her daughter for a moment before speaking, her voice regal and haughty.\n\n\"Eileithyia,\" Hera began,\n\n\"Your anger is justified. But remember, Clio is just another of your father's bastards. It is only fitting that she would choose another bastard daughter of Zeus to assist her in birthing her own. Clio's choice does not diminish your importance to Olympus, your abilities or mastery of your domain.\"\n\n\"But it's a slight, Mother!\" Eileithyia protested, her eyes flashing with indignation.\n\"It's a slight against me, against my domain! Which I held well before Father even looked at Leto!\"\n\nHera grimaced, she was well aware that after the issue with Metis, Leto had been one of Zeus' first choices for queen. However none of Metis's cousins had agreed to wed Zeus. And yet, the titaness still besmirched Hera's marriage.\n\n\"I will take Clio and Artemis to task,\" Hera spoke to her daughter.\n\n\"Remember, you are still the goddess of childbirth, and you are still revered.\"\n\nEileithia frowned.\n\"Not as much as I was before Artemis was born.\"\n\nHera sent her daughter her way as she formulated the plan of attack. Zeus did not very favour Clio. The Muse was too devoted to her domain. Zeus, all too often, did not like how he was portrayed in Clio's records, nor did he like having to deal with the complaints of others who did not like how they were recorded. But Clio had Apollo's favour and had a very important role in Olympus. Zeus still held a fondness for her mother, Memnosyne. On the other hand, Artemis and Athena were one of Zeus's unabashed favourites.\n\nHera had to leave Artemis out of this if she hoped to get her daughter any justice. Clio had erred against Hera's domain by dallying with a married man and conceiving his child. King Amyclas believed himself to be clever, but his wife detected the behaviour change and discovered the tryst. Hera's altars in Sparta had been flush with offerings as Diomede prayed to preserve her marriage, her status as queen, and her sons' birthrights. Clio would need to be struck via her demigod son. Hera closed her eyes as she sensed. Already, the Muse was deeply attached to her newborn. She would let some time pass for the bond to become even deeper and strike. Clio hoped to raise her son herself. Hera would not allow that to happen. A demigod had no place in Olympus. If there were a precedent, her husband would want to bring all of his mortal bastards into her home!\n\nClio kept Hyacinthus in her palace to ensure that the baby was not in the vicinity of a god being careless with their true form and incinerating her son by accident. Her sisters and her mother were delighted with her baby and would often visit, amusing the baby and hearing his gleeful laughter and cheerful gurgling. Memnosyne spoke seriously to the baby, lecturing him on many things. Clio had tried to explain several times that Hyacinthus was too young to understand anything, but her mother would not be moved. Artemis had dropped by; while she was adverse to adult males, she was fond of all small children. Apollo had been unable to visit; their shared Uncle Poseidon had invited him under the sea, in the very heart of his kingdom. Apparently, a new sea god, one Glaucus, had developed prophetic abilities and needed instruction. Clio thought this bliss would continue.\n\nZeus had summoned her in his presence. He was unhappy that a mortal was living in Olympus. It was only supposed to house gods. Clio had pointed out that Olympus was home to many nature spirits as well but Zeus had just gotten angrier and ordered her to give up her infant to his mortal father. Fortunately, her aunt Demeter had overheard their argument and had burst in, defending Clio.\n\n\"Once more, you want to separate a mother from her child!\"\n\nDemeter had declared, causing such a scene that the rest of the Olympians had to be called in to decide. There was a lot of arguing back and forth. Clio's head spun as her heart sank. Demeter planted herself by her side, viciously defending a mother's right to her child. Poseidon also supported Demeter. Clio figured out that Zeus must have offended him recently. Apollo was the one who resolved the issue. While Hyacinthus would need to be given up to Amyclas, he obtained the right for Clio to visit her son as often as she would like. Zeus was unhappy at this lenience.\n\n\"You may visit your son, Clio, but the moment that these visits interfere with your duties, I will rescind the privilege, and you will not be allowed to see him\"\n\nClio hid her devastation, thanking Demeter, Poseidon, and Apollo and hurrying to her palace. She would need to be very, very careful from now on to prevent herself from losing the right to see her son.\n\nAmyclas was overjoyed with the baby, admiring how beautiful, bright, strong and alert Hyacinthus was. His mother, Queen Dowager Sparta, was just as delighted but less effusive. She cast a critical eye on the demigod. She had been wife to a demigod and knew firsthand how exceptional they could be. Sparta loved her other grandsons, but the kingdom was her priority. Only the best prince could become the next king to keep Laconia strong and safe. Queen Diomede seethed with silent rage but did not dare to utter a single word. The divine wrath of an immortal goddess was not something to take lightly, even if that goddess was a mere Muse.\n\nAt Amyclas' discretion, Hyacinthus was assigned the quarters that had once belonged to his mortal grandfather, King Lacedaemon, son of Zeus. Amyclas justified that a demigod ought to be given quarters fit for a demigod. Diomede wanted to argue that Lacedaemon was the son of the mighty king of the gods, not the son of a mere muse but she bit her tongue and swallowed her venom while her mother in law's eyes were on her. Old Queen Sparta was not fooled. She was the one to chose and supervise Prince Hyacinthus' attendants. Diomede would have to say or sway in Hyacinthus' household. Which was a wise decision. Very, very often a divine glow was seen from the Old King's wing of the palace, signifying that Hyacinthus' immortal mother was visiting him. Amyclas always stared at the light descending from the sky with wistful longing but never dared to approach. His affair with the glorious Clio had ended, he had gotten a perfect son from her. To ask more was to tempt the fates and invite divine retribution upon himself and his kingdom.\n\n \n\nThe Tale of Icarus\n\nKing Minos stood on the rocky cliffs overlooking the azure waters surrounding his mighty kingdom, his eyes scanning the horizon. The sun dipped low, casting a warm glow on the waves. The ship carrying the famed Daedalus was due any moment now.\n\nThe salty breeze ruffled Minos' regal purple robes as he waited. Daedalus, the brilliant inventor from Athens, had been sent to Crete by King Aegeus. Minos had received a formal request from his fellow king but he had long been aware of the contents of it. As any king worth the title, Minos had eyes and ears in every kingdom of note. He had long been aware of what was going on in Athens under Aegeus' own nose.\n\nAs a demigod son of Zeus, Minos held precious knowledge that mere mortals like Aegeus' were denied. Daedalus was not just a brilliant inventor from an excellent lineage. He was the son of bright-eyed Athena, one of her curiously created mind children. Minos stay in Chiron's camp did not coincide with Daedalus, he would have liked the opportunity to establish a rapport with the greatest mind of their age. The same mind that Aegeus was carelessly throwing away.\nTo be fair to the Athenian King, Daedalus had been caught murdering his own nephew, but that could have been solved without casting Daedalus away. They could have claimed Daedalus to have been possessed by an eidolon. A few bags of gold to a few priests and they would have confirmed such. Or crafted a tale that Talos had attacked first and Daedalus had just been defending himself. Is not like the boy had not given Daedalus ample reason to kill him.\n\nAs the ship's silhouette emerged, Minos clenched his fists. Daedalus had not just brought himself to Crete but also a revolutionary invention, the new and improved sails. His original sails had revoluntionized seafaring and commerce and those had just been crude, ordinary canvas sails that flapped clumsily in the wind. No, these were sleek, efficient and adjusted automatically to harness every gust. Minos had conversed via Iris Message with Daedalus often since the trial in Athens. He had seen the designs and marvelled at their ingenuity.\n\n\"Daedalus!\" Minos called out as the ship docked. The gangplank lowered, and the inventor stepped onto Cretan soil. His eyes sparkled with intelligence, and his hands bore the calluses of countless experiments. The calluses of swordsmanship as well, but few knew him to be a demigod.\n\n\"King Minos,\" Daedalus greeted, bowing low.\n\n\"I bring you the future -- the sails that will propel your ships faster, smoother and with less effort. Imagine the trade routes that you can open, the wealth than you can amass!\"\n\nMinos nodded, his mind racing. The Athenians had exiled Daedalus, blinded by their sanctimousness. They could not appreciate the genius in their midst and accept that genius could have a price. But Minos saw opportunity were others saw a blood crime.\n\n\"The Athenians are fools,\" Minos muttered.\n\n\"They cast out a man who could have elevated their city-state. Now, I shall profit from their ignorance.\"\nDaedalus smiled knowingly.\n\n\"Indeed, King Minos. Let us usher in a new era of maritime supremacy. Our ships will glide like eagles, and the coffers will overflow.\"\n\nAnd as the sun sunk beneath the waves and the stars blinked into existence, Minos whispered to the sea breeze.\n\n\"Welcome to Crete, Daedalus. May your genius light our path.\"\n\nDaedalus marvelled at the Port of Knossos, which counted as a city in its own right rather than just part of the rest of Crete's royal capital, Knossos. Daedalus had always been fond of the sea, unusually among his maternal siblings. He did not dare to lower himself in the waters since the sea god was not fond of Athena's spawns but enjoyed watching the sea and being on a ship. This voyage had been a delight; he had done so much work with hardly anyone bothering him.\n\nMinos had promised him a household, lands and cattle in exchange for his new sails. Instead of establishing himself in Knossos proper, Daedalus had in mind to establish himself in the Port of Knossos. As Minos had pointed out, it was a short horseback ride from the port to the royal palace. It was almost a shame that the Port was not its own separate city.\n\nQueen Pasiphae was everything one could expect of a minor goddess gifted in marriage to a mortal king as a reward. She was intimidatingly beautiful and had impeccable manners. She was also interested in matching him with one of her many noblewomen. While marriage to a woman of local lineage would be greatly helpful in establishing him in Crete, Daedalus was utterly reluctant to do so. He had seen his father's marriage. A cold, tense union not unlike war.\n\nHe was devoted to his work and would have little time and interest in a young bride. Being neglected would make said bride bitter and resentful, and before long, he would become his father and his bride his stepmother. He declined Queen Pasiphae as graciously as he could. The immortal seemed to understand. Her sister, the famed immortal sorceress Circe, approved of him for the first time when he explained how unsuited he was to marriage. The sorceress finally drew him in conversation, and Daedalus was able to learn more about a most fascinating and elusive subject: magic.\n\nPasiphae and Circe, one wed to a man she despised against her will and the other having suffered enough indignities to put her off marriage, might respect Daedalus' choice to remain unattached, but Athena would not. Her plan relied on her getting Daedalus to wed, have a child and then use the child to punish Daedalus. She knew who she needed to bring her plan to fruition, Eros, god of love.\n\nAthena approached Zeus, who welcomed his beloved daughter with a smile.\n\n\"Athena, my dear child,\" He spoke to her.\n\"What brings you here?\"\n\n\"It's my demigod son, Daedalus, the brillian craftsman. He has grown lonely, cast from his city, into a foreign land, consumed by his inventions. I believe he needs love, companionship. I wish for him to find a partner, to marry.\n\nZeus leaned back from her with a laugh.\n\n\"Love and marriage? Love fades away like the mist in sunlight and marriage all to often turns sour.\"\n\nAthena thought of a different approach.\n\n\"Your son, King Minos delights in having Daedalus in his court, but the inventor has to blood tie to Crete. He needs to marry and have children of Cretan blood to fully tie him to Minos' kingdom.\"\n\nZeus looked thoughtful, his Cretan son had done him great honors and built several temples in his honor. It brought renown to Zeus to have kingly sons.\n\n\"Father, Eros owes you a debt. Remember Psyche? The mortal girl who captured his heart? You granted her immortality, made her a goddess, and Eros, in turn, owes you favours.\"\n\nZeus glanced at Aphrodite's palace in the distance and then at the palace of the sun, which housed Apollo. The two Olympians that had bitterly opposed Psyche's immortality. Aphrodite out of jealously for the girl's beauty. Apollo because he despised Eros and wished to watch him suffer. Something about a son of Clio, Athena could not be bothered to remember.\n\n\"Psyche? Ah, yes. A tangled tale, that was. Very well Athena. What do you propose?\"\n\nAthena smiled, glad to once again have gotten her way. Her father never denied her anything. As unpleasant as it had been to be swallowed as a fetus, the guilt of eating her other and very nearly her was very useful.\n\n\"I ask that you command Eros to shoot an arrow into Daedalus' heart. Let him fall deeply in love with a Cretan woman of good status, and may that love lead to marriage. Daedalus deserves happiness, and perhaps his passion will ignite new creations. Have you seen the glorious statues of you that adorn your temples in Knossos? They were the creation of Daedalus.\"\n\n\"You are persistent, my daughter. Very well. Eros shall heed your request. But remember, mortal affairs are unpredictable. Love can be both a blessing and a curse.\"\n\nAthena relied on love becoming a curse to Daedalus, but she smiled and nodded, accepting her father's warning.\n\n\"Thank you, Father. Daedalus will be grateful, and perhaps his love will inspire wonders beyond even our imagination.\"\n\nZeus gestured for an attendant to approach and ordered him to fetch Eros and bring him to Zeus.\n\nEros has been with his beloved Psyche and their daughter Hedone when he received the summons to Zeus. His flawless face darkened with irritation. Since his wife's apotheosis his grandfather constantly summoned him. Everytime a pretty mortal caught his eye. As grateful as he was to have his family immortal and thus safe from his many enemies, the summons were starting to grate. Eros was used to not being accountable to anyone other than his mother, who rarely made him do something he didn't want to. Unfortunately, mother felt threatened by Psyche's beauty, forcing Eros to turn to Zeus.\n\nAs it was, the one with the demand of him was not Zeus, but his favored daughter, the goddess of wisdom. Athena apparently wished for her son Daedalus to fall in love, wed and reproduce. Eros was very suspicious. Hermes had visited him and Psyche to inform of how Athena and her brilliant son had a severe falling out. Now she wished to reward the son that humiliated her by committing a blood crime and got himself exiled from her patron city? Eros smelled a rat, he had a feeling that he was being set up for something. Zeus murmured about it needing to be a Cretan woman so Daedalus' genius could be bound to Minos' kingdom.\n\nThat informed him what this was about. The most worshipped gods in Crete had since the dawn of the mortals been Poseidon and Demeter. Minos was changing that by promoting the worship of Zeus. Daedalus had built several glorious temples, the likes of it had not been seen. Athena planned to deliver a blow to Poseidon and use Eros for it.\n\nEros smirked, know he knew how to counter her. He would agree to the request yes. But the woman he would chose for Daedalus it would not be one Athena would like. Poseidon had many nymph daughters living in Crete. Eros knew of one in particular, a rather young one by the name of Naucrate. The naiad was just as disinterested in matters of the heart and flesh as Daedalus was. She very much wished to join the retinue of Artemis. Yet another that sought to defy him and his mother. Eros accepted to help Athena. One his way back to his family he told to every god that he met that Athena planned to make her son Daedalus wed. This way when tragedy struck, Poseidon would know were to place the blame. Right at Athena's feet.\nPlacing Daedalus and Naucrate in each other's path was a child's play for Eros. Striking them with his arrows was even easier. They were both enchanted with each other. Daedalus took Naucrate to Pasiphae and introduced her as his wife-to-be. Helios's sorcerous daughter was immediately suspicious. Daedalus waxed so poetic that he was struck by love instantly. That told Pasiphae all that she needed to know. Eros showed himself to her and made a silencing gesture to her. The minor, unimportant goddess blanched before giving him a curt nod. She would keep her mouth shut. She would not dare to make an enemy of him.\n\nPasiphae busied herself organizing the nuptials and teaching the naiad now to run a household fit for a man of means and standing. Eros ensured that Athena was otherwise preoccupied. Quite a few of her priestesses broke their vows, and she was busy running around and punishing them. Nothing as dramatic as Medusa, unfortunately. That particular monster had been most amusing. Eros vaguely recalled a demigod sister of his. One Smilax had goaded quite a few of her enemies into going after Medusa and never returning. His mother had been proud of her and the strength of her Charmspeak. Smilax had been the lover of Crocus of Lacedaemonia, the closest friend of the Spartan Prince Hyacinthus.\n\nDaedalus had been wed and had a newborn son in the crib by the time Athena was done punishing her erring priestesses. To Eros surprise she showed up in front of him, furious.\n\n\"You wed my son to a seaspawn!\"\n\nEros smirked while notching his arrow, taking aim and striking a random satyr.\n\n\"My dearest aunt. You told me to make your son fall in love. I chose the most beautiful of the available women in Crete. She is a naiad. Daughter of a river.\"\n\nAthena stamped her foot.\n\n\"She is a daughter of Poseidon! Not some minor river god!\"\nEros observed as the satyr caught sight of a lovely nymph. He notched another arrow. This one made of lead. When the satyr staggered over to the pretty nymph he let loose the arrow. The nymph shrunk back, screeching in horror at the satyr and bolting as quick as the wind. The satyr quickly followed in pursuit. Eros chuckled.\n\n\"Never fails to be amusing.\"\n\nAthena seized him by the shoulder and spun him around to face her. Eros snarled.\n\n\"You will undo your magic! I will not have a son of mine enamoured by such a creature!\"\n\nShe flashed away, taking him with her. Eros was unsurprised to find himself in Daedalus house. The demigod was sweetly feeding his wife a few ripe red strawberries. Athena made a noise of disgust.\n\n\"Fix it or I will go to my father. You are supposed to obey him in exchange of Psyche's immortality!\"\n\nEros clenched his teeth, gathering some blood red energy in his palm and hurling them both at the happy couple. He saw the change the moment they were hit. They both froze. Daedalus with a strawberry staining his fingers, Naucrate with her head titled up and her mouth opened like a little bird. The both sprang away from each other. One stared at the other with utter, uncomprehending horror. Naucrate was the first to break. She sprang away from Daedalus and let out a howl of pure anguish, her hands going to her breasts, once virginal, now leaking with milk. As if on cue the infant in the crib let out a wail. Naucrate flinched, inching away from the sound. Daedalus quickly hurried over and picked up the baby, gently and tenderly cradling him against his chest.\n\n\"I realise now that this was not the choice of either of us. But we are now wed, and we have a son. For the sake of Icarus we must keep our household in order. I swear to you on the Styx that I shall not touch you without your consent.\"\nMortal, nymph, god and goddess heart the clap of thunder, signifying that the oath had taken hold.\n\nNaucrate still looked stricken but she calmed at Daedalus' oath. She took a deep breath and held her arms out for the infant, bringing him to her breast. Icarus drunk deeply, a sign of a healthy child. Athena glared at both woman and baby.\n\n\"At least he loves his child. I curse you, Icarus, son of Daedalus. To die young, die horribly so your father and everyone that loves you can suffer untold agony!\"\n\nEros was no stranger to cruelty, he was love and love was cruel but this took him aback. Athena was cursing her own grandson as a newborn?\n\n\"What are you doing? He is a baby!\"\n\nAthena gave him an infuriatingly smug and cold smile.\n\n\"He was born so I could curse him. Why would I want Daedalus to have a son otherwise?\"\n\nEros' jaw dropped as Athena flashed away, still preening at having gotten one over him. Eros's red eyes gleamed as he held his bow tightly. Curious, he made his way to the crib. After feeding the boy, the parents retreated to another room to negotiate their lives from now on. Eros peered at the baby, who was awake and observed him right back--a clear-sighted little mortal. Eros' brows rose, amused despite himself, before frowning. He knew this soul. Had seen him in the prayers of far too many infatuated mortals. Even seen gods enamoured with him.\n\n\"So little prince, you have been reborn? You will met Apollo again. It will be just as before. You will be delirously happy. But just like before, tragedy will strike and you will once again lay dead as Apollo weeps in agony.\"\n\n \n\nModern times: Olympus during Solstice, five years after Percy Jackson's birth\n\nPoseidon was worried. Hades had once again visited at Winter Solstice. Demeter was pointedly pretending their brother didn't exist. Hera was following her example. Zeus was angry. Even mentioning Hades never failed to infuriate their youngest brother nowadays. Not since Hades had started to send monsters to torment Thalia Grace. Zeus had been forced to interfere several times, giving the girl a spear from the forges of Hephaestus and regularly sending Amalthea the goat to her. Poseidon had never been more grateful that his queen, Amphitrite, was not the jealous type. It had been Hera who discovered the existence of Thalia due to her incessant drive to keep watch on Zeus. Amphitrite was too busy with her duties as queen and her domains as a goddess to stalk her own husband and king obsessively. Percy was as safe as a demigod of the big three could be.\n\nPoseidon still felt uneasy when Hades approached him. Demeter glared at them both.\n\n\"My furies saw several Cyclops from your forges in New York. Why such a curious happening, Brother?\"\n\nPoseidon had sent those Cyclops to check on Percy. They had to be careful to keep out of her sight. She had been able to see beyond the mist with the first one and had screamed for the daycare attendant.\n\n\"My Cyclops are not slaves chained to the forges. They have personal time to spend as they see it fit.\"\n\nHades gave him a disbelieving look.\n\n\"I would have thought that they would spend that time in the forges, in private projects. That is what Hephaestus' cyclops do.\"\n\nHephaestus' cyclops were still Poseidon's sons. It had always been a slight. Zeus regularly forced him to give up his sons to Hephaestus service to keep the innovation rate stable between Olympus and Atlantis. At least Hephaestus treated his sons well. Poseidon would prefer if Hephaestus limited himself to keeping the Amazon's abandoned sons rather than stealing the Cyclops.\n\n\"How could the Furies tell an Atlantean Cyclops from one in the service of Hephaestus?\"\n\nHades gestured for a nymph to bring him wine.\n\n\"He was still wearing the uniform.\"\n\nPoseidon would find that one and scold him.\n\n\"He was lingering by a daycare, apparently. Careful, tending to small children is not a Cyclops job.\"\n\nPoseidon was certain that his brother knew. Checking on Zeus and finding him busy eyeing some nymph as Hera bristled, Poseidon send a mental comand to his son Anteros. Increase Zeus' infatuation to keep him busy. From his place with the other Erotes, Anteros nodded back at his father, plumed wings twitching slightly.\n\n\"I have some seaweed wine from Atlantis in my palace. Would you like to partake? Brother?\"\n\nPoseidon spun and marched out of the feast hall, trident tightly clutched in his fist. Hades followed. Once in the palace, Poseidon grabbed Hades by his robes and dragged him close.\n\n\"What do you know?\"\n\nHades gave him an unimpressed look. It reminded Poseidon of the time in their father's stomach. Poseidon would make grandiose and unrealistic plans to free them and Hades would shoot down ever single one of them.\n\n\"Five years ago, I felt a tremor; it felt like you but also not. I went to check and found her. I think I might have held her in my arms before you got the chance.\"\n\nPoseidon grabbed the robe tighter. That had been the only time he was able to hold Percy. When Sally and their daughter went to Montauk, he was able to disguise himself as an ice cream seller so he could see his daughter up close and even exchange a few words with her, but have been robbed of one of his rights as her father rankled.\n\n\"So you have known for five years. Why tell me now?\"\n\n\"The monsters bound to me will not bother her without my direct order but others are taking notice of her. Everytime one of your brats dies, you throw a fit and send quite a few souls to my kingdom, making more work for me.\"\n\nIf it was just that Poseidon would eat his trident, but it was unlikely that Hades would reveal more. His brother had always held his secrets too close to his chest.\n\n\"I thank you for your warning and for your grace to leave my daughter be.\"\n\nHades readjusted his robes.\n\n\"You have not harmed my children or lovers. I see no need to retaliate in kind.\"\n\nAh, the death of Beryl Grace and Thalia's myriad torments. Poseidon was not inclined to ask and Hades simply saw himself out, leaving Olympus and going back to his domain, to his queen. Poseidon summoned one of his most trusted and loyal Oceanids, Galaxaura, the goddess of oceanic breezes and refreshments. She had always enjoyed tending to children.\n\nGalaxaura was unhappy that her king had broken an oath on the Styx, but she agreed to look into his daughter. Before leaving to check on Percy she pointedly reminded him that it had been a long time since the Oceanid's divine directive to be caretakers of important children had been honoured. Poseidon did not offer any opinion on that. Times had changed, and Olympus and Atlantis with it.\n\nSome weeks later, he read over a financial report from Galaxaura's modeling agency, which fell under the broader holdings of Atlantis. She detailed all the new child models she had contracted, including Percy Jackson. The report noted that Percy would use Marina Jackson as a professional name--her middle name, which Sally had chosen to honour Poseidon. Galaxaura's idea, apparently the Oceanid, was adverse to a sea child having the same name as a skyspawn.\n\nPoseidon sighed with relief. Galaxaura's agency was monster-free, just like other personal properties of minor gods. Hebe's arcade and Iris' grocery stores were mayhaps safer, but he had no sway other than either goddess, and they were too close to Zeus and Hera.\n\nKing Amyclas weeping and blubbering because he must now be separated from the love of his life, who is not his wife and is an immortal muse who needs to go back to OlympusClio (the most aro to ever aro): Sorrows, sorrows, prayersClio: I will scorn the old goddess of childbirth in favour of the newer, shinier one. What could possibly go wrong?Apollo is being kept away from baby Hyacinthus because he should not have any interaction with the child version of his future lover.\n\nEiliethyia: This insult must not be borne! I will cry to my mommy!Hera: I, the goddess of family and motherhood, will separate a mother from her baby just for shits and giggles.Demeter: I fucking hate Olympus! They are constantly ripping babies out of their mother's arms!\n\nAthena: I hate my son so I will curse his newborn sonEros: Apollo's favourite flower is back from the dead. Athena made me make him.\n\nHades: Hey Poseidon, are you sure that your extremely forbidden daughter is hidden well enough?Poseidon: Anteros, god of mutual love, my son, please make Zeus cheat on Hera again to keep him busy while I talk to your less terrible uncle without him getting paranoid about it and ruining my entire century.Hades: I held your baby daughter before you; sucks to be you, little brother.Poseidon: why you little!Galaxaura, an Oceanid that is barely mentioned in mythology and whom I literally picked from a jar of names is about to be handed the demigod equivalent of a nuclear warhead.\n\nHyacinthus is nearly killed by two wicked stepmothers working together.\n\nIcarus is haunted by his past life.\n\nPercy has a close call\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nTale of Hyacinthus\n\nPrince Hyacinthus of Sparta grew from a sweet, cute baby to a lively, lovely toddler and then older. The older he grew, the more beautiful he became. He became the talk of the Peloponnese when his godly mother surrendered him to his kingly father. The world's prying eyes never left him, and there was always something to talk about. As was typical with demigods, he took his first steps earlier than fully mortal children, spoke his first words before his father expected it and had no trouble handling weapons with barely any instruction.\n\nHis mother might just be a muse, but all demigods were bred for war; they were the gods' weapons, which showed in each of them. Hyacinthus was not the only demigod in Sparta, but he was the most famous. It was kept a secret when goddesses had demigods, maybe whispered in hushed tones to avoid offending Zeus.\n\nHyacinthus was on public record as the son of the goddess Clio. That made him stand out from the demigods with godly fathers. Those were a dime a dozen in a prosperous kingdom like Sparta. Many of their women were beautiful, independent, and fierce and the gods noticed. When a god noticed a mortal woman, demigods happened.\n\nHyacinthus was special, his mortal parent was not a woman who might be shunted aside from society but the king of all he surveyed. And Hyacinthus was beautiful, very beautiful. Amyclas and his mother, their city's namesake couldn't be prouder, but Diomede and her children were most certainly not.\n\nAs Diomede had predicted, her sons could not compete with a demigod. Great grandsons of Zeus they might be, but so was Hyacinthus, along with being a grandson. The little boy was stronger, quicker on his feet, and had a knack for strategy, which made Sparta's generals smile indulgently. Amyclas did not help matters by taking his youngest son with him to every assembly or political gathering.\n\nThe well-born of Laconia quickly saw which side of the bread was dipped in olive oil. It would not be the first time a stronger, more talented younger son was elevated to crown prince and became king over his older brothers. Spartans followed strength and ability, not primogeniture.\n\nBefore Amyclas had started acting strange and sneaking away to see Clio, Diomede had not worried. While Amyclas had the occasional dalliance with pretty serving girls and suchlike, Diomede had been able to ensure that no child resulted from this or if unable to prevent the birth, she would bribe the elders to order the child exposed. Diomede was not about to allow her own bloodline to be eclipsed and usurped.\n\nAs a young girl she had been devastated to have been sent away from her home in Thessaly all the way to Laconia. The distance between the two kingdoms ensured that she would never be able to go home again. Not even for a visit. It just was not practical when the journey took months both on land and on sea. For better or worse she had to make Sparta her home. Something that would have been much easier if Amyclas' exacting taskmaster of a mother had been dead, or if at least Amyclas had fallen in love with her.\n\nAs a young bride, Diomede had prayed fervently to Hera and Aphrodite so that her marriage could be happy and husband would love her. It had never happened. They managed to produce plenty of children, but never developed companionship. Spartan women were different from the women of the other lands beholden to the Olympians. It took Diomede long years to realise that to appeal to Amyclas she had to be bold and fierce.\n\nIt went against everything her mother Orsinome had taught her. Her father Lapithes had even advised her to be mee and obedient toward her husband and not let her reluctance to marry far away show. To be anything else was to shame her family, her home and kingdom. Diomede had followed their instructions to the letter but it had backfired. Amyclas had been disappointed in her.\n\nDiomede really should have listened to her father's mother, the naiad nymph Stilbe. Her grandmother had told Diomede not to listen to her parents but be genuinely herself in order to win over her husband. Unfortunately, she had dismissed her grandmother as flighty and foolish.\n\nHer father had just established a kingdom and was desperate to make his household appear respectable and beyond reproach. He had been unable to find his daughter a nearby prince or king to marry and sent her far away to Sparta barely knowing anything what the Spartans were like. Stilbe had more knowledge on the matter but Lapithes did not like to listen to his mother.\n\nStilbe had produced Lapithes with Apollo. Normally, being the son of a god and a naiad would be a source of pride but Lapithes had a twin. That twin was not a demigod but a centaur, a monster. Lapithes could not brag to be the son of Apollo because others would recall who his twin brother was and eye him with derision. When Olympian gods coupled with nymphs what their children came out as could vary. The children could be regular demigods, they could be nymphs or they could be monsters. The only god who felt no shame producing monsters was Poseidon.\n\nWhile Apollo famously took in Chiron and taught him arts, letters and combat he looked ascance upon Stilbe and her sons. He did provide for them but did not like to be reminded that he had produced a centaur himself. Apollo had blamed Centaurus on Stilbe since he had never before produced a monster. Numerous demigods, Hymenatus with Calliope and the three muses of the lyre just by himself. But never before Stilbe had Apollo produced a monster.\n\nThis disdain showed in how he treated Stilbe's descendants. Diomede felt saddened that her godly grandfather had thrown his support behind his muse and her son, and refused to acknowledge Diomede and her children.\n\nShe had almost exclusively worshipped Hera since her husband began his affair with that wretched muse. Her patience and devotion had been repaid. Hera had appeared to Diomede and agreed to help her rid herself of the thorny issue of Hyacinthus in exchange for a new temple. She had agreed, determined to use her own jewelry and the portion of her dowry that Amyclas had allowed her to keep due to Spartan custom, if she could not get the treasury to fund it. She was heavily pregnant with her sixth child and could no longer tolerate having Hyacinthus in her home.\n\nThe queen of Sparta had hoped that Hera would strike the boy dead but was disappointed. Diomede was reminded that Hyacinthus could not die anywhere close to Sparta. Diomede herself would be the first suspect. If that happened Amyclas would pass the throne to one of his distant cousins rather than let any of Diomede's sons have it. He would likely throw her and her children out in the cold. Hera was no one's assassin, but the queen of the gods. She would assist Diomede but it would be in her own terms.\n\nHera would transport the boy far away from Laconia to Attica since the kingdoms were always in conflict with one another. The boy would die. He was a child, and he had spent his entire life being pamperred in a lavish palace. Anything could happen to him on the road. He could get kidnapped, sold as a slave, and spend his life labouring under the crack of a whip. He could be eaten by a monster or just be killed by bandits and other brigands. Either way, he would be gone, no longer threatening her sons' birthright. Diomede would be able to swear that she had not laid a hand on the boy or ordered anyone to harm him.\n\nThe two queens, one godly and the other mortal struck their dark bargain.\n\nOn the next dawn, eight year old Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta woke up with the sun. He was astonished that he was no longer in his quarters but in a forest. The first thing that he did was to try and pray to his mother. He reached for her divine presence as taught but was interrupted by a sharp pain in his skull. He immediately stoped, braced himself and tried again.\n\nMultiple tries told him that it would not be possible to contact his mother. Something or someone more powerful than her was blocking him from praying to her.Hyacinthus was unfortunately on his own. His mother Clio, had gifted him with a vivid imagination, which now conjured far too many scenarios of what could happen to him. Clio had not shied form telling him the tales of demigod princes and young lords persecuted by their stepmothers.\n\nHe had inherited powers form his godly mother, what she called post cognition, the ability to view the past. His father King Amyclas had trained him in combat since Hyacinthus was a child.\n\nHyacinthus was still dressed in his chiton, a lovely blue and he had golden armbands, necklace and golden circlet. Signs of wealth that must be carefully hidden. He had heard tales of what happened to well born travelers flashing too much gold. He took off his chiton and deliberately smeared it with dirt and dust until the rich blue was completely covered. Using the celestial bronze dagger that his mother had gifted him he cut of a portion of it and used it to make a small bag to put his gold in. He still needed to pin up the linen cloth with the golden pins so he broke off a pine branch and smeared it on the pins, making the gold look like a lesser metal.\n\nHe checked his reflection on a ripple free pond to see if he still looked like a princeling or if he could pass as one of the grubby poor children he had seen in the poorer areas of his father's city. Thinking it good he sought a way out of the forest, dagger held ready.\n\nThe forest was dense, the scent of pine and moss filled his nostrils. Normally he would delight in it. Hyacinthus loved it when his father took him along in hunts. But it was different when he was alone. Gone were the Spartan warriors, their echoing laughter as they watched their prince handle the bow and thrown javelins at different beasts. Most of all, Hyacinthus missed the warmth of his mother's embrace.\n\nHe was alone, lost in a realm unknown. He knew the forests of Lacedaemonia. These were not.\n\nHyacinthus' heart pounded as he surveyed his surroundings. Towering trees loomed overhead, their leaves whispering in the breeze. The sun, a pale disk behind the thick canopy, offered little guidance. Fear clutched at his chest, but he remembered his father's words: \"A true prince faces adversity with unwavering resolve.\"\n\nAnd so, with determination, Hyacinthus set forth. He walked for days, surviving on wild berries, rabbits and birds he was able to catch, and the hope that Sparta lay beyond the next hill. His small legs carried him across meadows, through shadowed valleys, and over babbling brooks. It took him a while to encounter people. In the banks of a large river.\n\nThat was a deeply unpleasant encounter. The people that he met stared at his face and started commenting on how beautiful he was and how much he would fetch if sold to the right people. One of them opined that he would be delighted to sample the goods himself. The boy shrank away from them, feeling disgust.\n\nHyacinthus had been warned about slavers. These disgusting creatures went around kidnapping people and sold them in slavery. He had been warned to be careful, even royalty sometimes fell victim.\n\nHyacinthus jumped in the river and swam away from the people that wanted to enslave him. Now wary of speaking to anyone. As much as he would prefer to avoid people he needed to find out where he was and how far Sparta was.\n\nAfter putting some distance he swam out of the river and patted his face. His whole life he had been told that he was beautiful by everyone, his parents, the servants, his father's subjects, all passing guests. Even from his half siblings, but they did not mean it as a compliment.\n\nHis half siblings never had a kind word to say to him. Hyacinthus knew that they despised him. Were he to die, they would rejoice. Argalus used to pinch and shove him when Hyacinthus was smaller. He did not stop until Hyacinthus shoved him back, making the older prince fall and then kicked him.\n\nCynortas never dared to lay a hand on him outside of combat practice but he had plenty of malicious words and insults. Cynortas was especially fond of reminding Hyacinthus that he was a bastard and that demigods die young and suffer tragically.\n\nHarpalus was just one year older. He constantly screamed that Hyacinthus should not have been born. People were always comparing them and Harpalus would rage, throw things and get scolded and punished by their father. Every time this happened he would glare at Hyacinthus.\n\nHis sisters were not accepting either. Laodamia and Hegesandre were beautiful, people always said so. But people always added, not as beautiful as Hyacinthus. Laodamia had told him that their family was happy before Hyacinthus arrived. Hegesandre refused to even speak to him since a famed artist that had been commissioned to make a likeness of her refused to do so until he was allowed to make a likeness of Hyacinthus. That likeness was supposed to go to the family that their father intended for Hegesandre to marry.\n\nHyacinthus' stepmother had announced that she was expecting another child six months ago. He was certain that this sibling would hate him too. Diomede would not allow for anything else. It seemed to be his fate to be constantly surrounded by people who despised him. It was tiring, and very disheartening.\n\nEventually he encountered a few peasant children playing a game over some patterns drawn on the dirt. They told him that he was near Corinth and they pointed the way there and the way to Argo. Hyacinthus thanked them and headed for Corinth. There would be temples to every Olympian in the city. While his mother was being blocked from him. He could pray to another god.\n\nClio had told him how she had hoped to raise him herself but Zeus had ruled that no mortal should dwell on Olympus. He had wanted Clio to completely abandon Hyacinthus but other gods had risen in defense of his mother. The goddess Demeter first among them. Clio had encouraged Hyacinthus to regularly make lavish offerings to Demeter.\n\nOnce in Corinth, Hyacinthus walked around, drawing curious stares as he tried to find the temple of Demeter. He heard people talking as he walked. Apparently his parents were looking for him. His father had offered a rich reward for his safe return. His mother had promised even more, but no one seemed certain of what it was.\n\nAt the temple the guards almost did not let him in. While Hyacinthus had the foresight to wash his chiton and himself in a brook before going in the city, but the linen cloth had faded in color and the threads had unravelled in places, making it looke shabby and poor.\n\nA priestess chanced by as Hyacinthus was arguing with the belligerent guards and ordered them to let the boy in. She motioned for him to follow.\n\nShe led him to a chamber that held several basins of water. She ritually purified Hyacinthus before leading him to the inner sanctum, where Demeter's rich altar lay.\n\n\"You must make an offering and then pray to Lady Demeter.\"\n\nHyacinthus opened his satchel, revealing the gold items inside, making the priestess gasp.\n\n\"You are no ordinary urchin are you?\"\n\n\"No, I am not.\"\n\nHyacinthus placed the circlet, arm bands and necklace on the altar, knelt respectfully and started to pray.\n\nHe prayed fervently to Demeter, asking to be restored to his mother. He stayed praying for hours, struggling to stay still and focus on the proper formula for appealing to an Olympian.\n\nEventually his patience paid.\n\n\"Let me in!\" He heard his mother scream out.\n\nHyacinthus' head snapped up and he turned around as his mother hurried in. The priestess immediately fell to her knees and began chanting.\n\nClio was in the larger form that she used when she visited during the summer solstice. Hyacinthus said one last thank you to Demeter and run to his mother. Clio immediately picked him up and embrace him.\n\n\"My precious, darling boy!\"\n\nMother and son left the temple, drawing murmurs and awed stares.\n\n\"Did anyone hurt you?\" Clio asked urgently.\n\n\"No, mother. I did encounter some slavers but I was able to jump into the river and escape.\"\n\nClio's face darkened.\n\n\"Picture them in your mind. I shall find them.\"\n\nAnd she would make them wish they had never been born, Hyacinthus was certain.\n\n\"Your father and I have been looking for you everywhere. Something was blocking me from finding you. I thought that you were dead but I hunted down Thanatos and he confirmed that he had not taken you.\"\n\n\"Diomede swore on the Styx that she did not lay hand on you, order anyone to do you harm. As if I can't see the loopholes in that oath. Or that I can't see that she is building a new temple to Hera.\"\n\nClio gritted her teeth as she reached her chariot. She paused to conjure some appropriate and clean clothing on her child.\n\n\"She has gone too far.\"\n\nHyacinthus remembered the nights spend high on trees because he was too afraid of being eated by beasts if he slept on the ground. He remembered the three days he had not eaten anything because there were no berries to be hand and he could not catch anything. It had been pine nuts that had saved him. He recalled the cold, calculating eyes of the slavers that had tried to grab him\n\n\"Yes, mother. She has. You know best.\"\n\nClio smiled tenderly at him.\n\n\"Don't you worry about anything. I will deal with her.\"\n\n\"My siblings will hate me even more.\" Hyacinthus whispered. Clio's face tightneed into a sneer.\n\n\"They are just people that you share a father with. Just like I have plenty of people that I share a father with and I don't consider my siblings.\"\n\n\"Diomede's children will always be envious and it is useless to try and get along with them. They will just spit on your kindness and do you harm.\"\n\nHyacinthus nodded. His mom was always right.\n\nShortly after they returned to Sparta, Queen Diomede fell severely ill shortly after the birth of her sixth child, a little princess that her husband called Polyboea. She who is worth many cattle. An ironic name, unlike her sisters Polyboea was no beauty. But Amyclas hoped that she would grow up to match her name. The royal physician, a son of Apollo by the name of Solon, diagnosed the queen with childbed fever and informed the royal family that she would not live long. Diomede's other children took umbrage and blamed their littlest sister. Polyboea only had one sibling willing to have anything to do with her, Hyacinthus. He was all too familiar with the feeling of being rejected and scorned by your own family. He vowed to himself to be a good brother to Polyboea.\n\n \n\nThe Tale of Icarus\n\nIcarus did not remember his mother. His father did not like to talk about her. Everytime Daedalus heard Naucrate's name his face would become sorrowful. The servants had told Icarus that she had died. Someone had transformed her from a naiad to a mortal woman and killed her. Some said that it was punishment for something. Naucrate had been planning to become a priestess before marrying Daedalus. The name most whispered was Athena. It would not be the first time Athena killed an erring priestess of hers. It was no stretch that she would kill a prospective priestess for reneging. The servants consoled Icarus that at least his mother had not been turned into a monster.\n\nIt was of little consolation to the little boy. He wanted a mother. Ariadne, his best friend had a mother. It was not fair that Icarus did not.\n\nIcarus followed a trail of flowers into the forest. Picking the prettiest among them. Maybe if he picked the best flowers, Ariadne's mother would be willing to be his mother. So entranced he was by the glowing, fragrant flowers that he did not notice that we walked further and further into the woods. In the exact forest where his dad had told him not to go, because it was infested with monsters.\n\nThe flowers led him into a cave. Four year old Icarus hesitate briefly but the pretty flowers beaconed him. He blinked his eyes, trying to focus but the fragrance made his vision blurry. Icarus walked in. As soon as he stepped in the dark cave the flowers vanished leaving just dried, blackened grass. He heard a growl and saw glowing, catlike eyes. Icarus bit a scream and bent down to pick up a rock which he threw at the creature. He picked up every rock and stone that he could spy but it only seemed to enrage the creature further. He breathed harshly, terrified.\n\nSuddenly, a bright light perced the darkness of the cave. A figure, tall and radiant, stepped into the care. Icarus's eye's widened as he recognized her. Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, the wild and archery. Her silver bow gleamed in the dim light, and her eyes wee as sharp as the arrows in her quiver. Icarus was awestruck by her sheer magnificence and power.\n\nArtemis moved with a grace that was both powerful and gentle. She drew and arrow from her quiver, nocked it to her bow, and aimed at the unseen monster. Icarus watched in silence, his heart pounding in his chest. He had never seeen anone so brave, so glorious. Even Queen Pasiphae and her sister Circe were outshone.\n\nWith a swift motion, Artemis released the arrow. It whistled through the air and found its mark. The monster roared in pain and retrated farther into the cave. Artemis didn't hesitate. She drew another arrow and let if fly. The monster roared again, then fell silent.\n\nArtemis turned to Icarus, her divine face softening. She reached a hand out to the child, and he took it, his small finger dwarfed by hers.\n\n\"You're safe now, Icarus,\" She said, her voice as soothing as a lullaby.\n\n\"How do you know my name, Lady Artemis?\" Asked the little boy.\n\nArtemis's face scrunched into a fearsome scowl and her sharp eyes grew cold as chips of ice.\n\n\"I noticed the trail of flowers since it is an intrusion into my domain and contronted the culprit.\"\n\nIcarus looked confused.\n\n\"Someone wanted to hurt me?\"\n\nHe was no stranger to this. Daedalus had many enemies. Icarus had been instructed many times to be careful of strangers and not to wander off on his own. He looked down in shame. He had disobeyed his father's instructions and nearly had been eaten by a monster.\n\nArtemis nodded but did not seem inclined to give him further details.\n\nAs they left the cave, Icarus looked up to Artemis. He was still in awe of her, of her bravery, her skill, her magnificence. He knew that he would remember this day, the day the goddess of the hunt had saved him, for the rest of his life.\n\nArtemis took him back home, much to the astonishment of everyone that came across them. The rumour spread like wildfire and Daedalus hurried to his home where he ordered his servants to set out a lavish feast in his courtyard with all the rare delicacies the household held.\n\nIcarus and Artemis walked through the Port of Knossos at a leisurely pace. Icarus holding to Artemis' hand with one hand and cheerfully pointing interesting landmarks to the goddess. Artemis heard with vague and benign disinterest. Her attention sharpening when Icarus mentioned that Ariadne, the princess was his best friend and that she was the smartest. The goddess smiled at the boy.\n\n\"I hope that the passing of the years do not drain away the sweetness from your. Or make you lose the respect that you have for women.\"\n\nIcarus lilted his head, like a curious little bird, not quite understanding. Artemis sighed.\n\n\"You will understand as you grow older little one.\"\n\n\"Why do all the grown ups say that?\"\n\nArtemis was saved from having to answer from Daedalus who called out to Icarus before going on his knees before Artemis.\n\n\"Lady Artemis, goddess of the hunt, glorious daughter of Leto and Zeus. I thank you for saving the life of my darling child.\" He mentioned to the feast set out for Artemis\n\nArtemis motioned for him to rise and picked up some fruit from the platters.\n\n\"The protection of young children is my domain. But the parents must do their part. Guard your son better.\"\n\nDaedalus seemed lost and instead of giving an answer to the goddess' reprimand he just hugged his son close.\n\nArtemis watched the easy affection between father and child.\n\n\"I will send my huntress tomorrow to bring Icarus to me for training. He showed remarkable bravery against the monster. I will teach him how to hunt so in the future he can defeat any monsters he encounters without divine assistance..\"\n\nDaedalus' mouth fell open and he gazed at his son like he had never seen him before.\n\n\"Of course, my lady. It will be as you wish.\"\n\nBowed Daedalus, immediately calling for his servant to go purchase fat cattle for him to sacrifice at Artemis' altar. The provisions from the feast were also given to the temple. The goddess of the Hunt had only taken a bit of fruit, but the rest of the food still belonged to her. The goddess' temple in Knossos would be well serviced this day.\n\nArtemis vanished in a pillar of light. She reappeared in her encampment where Chloris, the goddess of flowers was tangled up in a golden snare, several of Aremis' most trusted huntressess guarding her. Artemis' eyes grew hard as she looked at Chloris, her voice cold as she spoke.\n\n\"You tried to murder Icarus, a mere child. Explain yourself, Chloris.\"\n\nChloris, her face as pale as the lilies that adorned her hair, met Artemis' gaze.\n\n\"In his past life, Icarus was Prince Hyacinthus,\" she said, her voice trembling.\n\nArtemis' jaw dropped. Polyboea, one of her finest hunters gasped in astonishment and nearly dropped her bow.\n\n\"My lord husband, Zephyrus, the west wind, fell in love with him.\"\n\nArtemis' brow furrowed in disgust.\n\n\"And that justifies your attempt on a toddler's life? Trying to feed him to a monster?\" she asked, her voice dripping with disbelief.\n\nChloris looked down, her hands clutching the meadow flowers tight.\n\n\"I ... I was upset,\" She admitted.\n\n\"I lost everything. My husband was suborned in service to Eros and Aphrodite. While they were glad to protect him from your twin's wrath, they had no such intentions with me. To save myself from him I had to beg Hera to dissolve my marriage so Lord Apollo would stop persecuting me. But since I was not married to Zephyrus I had no place in Olympus and I could not go back home to the Isle of Best. I had to linger in the mortal world and the abandoned sacred places of nature gods.\"\n\nArtemis scoffed.\n\n\"The blame falls solely on Zephyrus. Hyacinthus rejected his advances to respect your marriage and had no interest in your husband. He was an innocent victim and a good man that deseved so much better! He deserved eternal life as my brother's consort! But Zephyrus murdered him, devastating my twin! And now you are blaming the toddler Hyacinthus was reborn as.\"\n\nChloris grimaced and cast he eyes down.\n\n\"Zephurus... he can't control his desires. He's... he's...\"\n\n\"A slut?\" Artemis flinished for Chloris, her vice sharp.\n\n\"Someone who would betray a devoted wife and try and take someone else' lover?\"\n\n\"For this god you decided to take your anger out on an innocent child? A child who has done no harm in his meagre four years of life? Who has no memory of his past life because like all the reborn he drank from the Lethe? Washing him clean of all memories?\"\n\nChloris was silent, her eyes still cast down, face carefully blank. Artemis shook her head, her expression stern.\n\n\"Your actions are unacceptable, Chloris,\" she said.\n\n\"No matter how hurt or angry you are, it does not justify harming an innocent.\"\n\nChloris' eyes gleamed.\n\n\"You killed Niobe's children, Artemis!\"\n\nThe slap echoed through Artemis sacred grotto in the Cretan forest. Artemis's face was a mask of fury.\n\n\"You dare!\" She hissed.\n\n\"You dare compare your petty jealously to my divine justice!\"\n\n\"I am a goddess just like you!\" Chloris raised her head to meet Artemis furious eyes.\n\nArtemis slapped her again.\n\n\"You were not born a goddess. Your divinity was gifted to you because Zephyrus wanted to marry you but your marriage is no more. He is now wed to Iris, a true goddess.\"\n\nBitter tears fell down Chloris' face.\n\n\"He did not chose to marry her! Hera forced him!\"\n\nArtemis shrugged.\n\n\"It does not change the fact that Iris is now his wife in the eyes of the gods. Which makes your attack on Icarus even more out of line. You have nothing to do with Zephyrus now.\"\n\nShe grabbed Chloris by the arm, forcing the goddess of flowers to her knees.\n\n\"Swear it, Chloris,\" Artemis commanded.\n\n\"Swear on the river Styx that you will never harm Icarus again.\"\n\nChlors nodded, tears streaming down her face.\n\n\"I swear it,\" She whispered and everyone heard the clap of thunder, signifying that the oath had taken hold.\n\nSatisfied, Artemis released her. She turned to leave, her attendant Polyboea, the younger sister of Hyacinthus following silently behind her. The rest of the huntressess followed suit. Chloris was left alone, the echo of her oath still hanging in the air.\n\n\"Polyboea,\" Artemis said, her voice softer when addressing her devoted follower of many years.\n\n\"You wish to meet your brother's reincarnation?\"\n\nPolyboea nodded, her large brown eyes shiny with unshed tears and filled with desperate longing and hope.\n\n\"Yes, my lady, please!\" She beseeched her patron goddess.\n\nArtemis gave her a small smile.\n\n\"I promise you, you will. But we must keep Icarus a secret from Apollo. He is too young for the former lovers to met. And I fear... I fear it will end tragically again. Apollo... he is very unlucky in love.\"\n\n \n\n- Modern Times -\n\nPercy Jackson was seven years old, she had just finished a photoshoot for a line of organic linen and cotton summerwear. She was resting in Laura's office because the photoshoot ran for hours in the bright and hot sun. When Laura first discovered Percy she had told her that her real name was Galaxaura, like the Oceanid and preferred to be addressed by her real name in private.\n\nShe run the agency that trained child models. Percy had been working there since she was five years old, after Galaxaura discovered her.\n\nGalaxaura explained that professionally she used Laura because having an unusual name was not advisable business wise. People had trouble pronouncing it properly and were offended and huffy when corrected. Also more than a few were very small minded and would avoid doing business with her just because she had a name that they did not deem as normal. Percy, whose legal name was Perseus, had shared her fair share of teasing about her name, understood clearly.\n\nPercy sat on the plush sofa, complaining to Galaxaura about her new evil stepfather, Smelly Gave.\n\n\"He is horrible,\" She told Galaxaura, her voice trembling.\n\n\"He is mean to my mom and to me and he smells like old rotten cheese.\"\n\nGalaxaura, with her sea-green eyes full of sympathy, patted her hand.\n\n\"I can't do anything about your mother's choice, Percy,\" she said.\n\n\"But I can make sure that Smelly Gabe doesn't touch your earnings.\"\n\nGalaxaura promised to set up a secure bank account for Percy, and that made her feel a little better.\n\nSuddenly, the door to the office opened, and without even knocking, in walked a man with curly black hair, twinkling blue eyes and a mischevious smile. He was wearing a tracksuit that Percy had seen USP guys wear. But no USP guy would be able to barge in Galaxaura's office. A regular delivery person would be handled by the staff at the entrance. If they were troublesome, security would usher them out.\n\nTo Percy's surprise, Galaxaura looked panicked and shot at look of terror towards Percy. That drew the man's attention toward Percy.\n\n\"Hey there little girl!\" He waved cheerfully. Percy somewhat dubiously waved back.\n\n\"Hermes! What are you doing here?\" Galaxaura demanded.\n\nPercy leaned forward, trying to see both adults.\n\n\"There are some dispreancies in your orders. I thought about coming to confirm with you before I take it to your boss and to mine.\"\n\nLaura gave him a smile that was all teeth.\n\n\"Very well. Why dont we go to a conference room?\"\n\nShe motioned for the man to follow him but one of Galaxaura's blue haired, assistants, Nadine, came in at a run.\n\n\"Laura! Aphrodite is on the line. She wants to talk to you urgently.\"\n\nThe man, Hermes, stopped.\n\n\"You better hurry Galaxaura. I can wait. You really don't want to make her wait.\"\n\nGalaxaura shot an anxious glance at Percy and followed Nadine.\n\nPercy was left alone with Hermes, the man that seemed to terrify Galaxaura. She didn't know what to do, so she did what her mom had told her to do when they had guests. Percy got up from the sofa, walked to the fridge and took out a can of bubbly water. From her own bag she took a few blue, chocolate chip cookies. She offered the refreshments to the man in the USP uniform. Hermes seemed delighted and thanked Percy for her politeness and hospitality. He pronounced hospitality in a very grand manner.\n\nWhen Galaxaura returned, Hermes was all smiles. He turned to her and said.\n\n\"Galaxaura, your have such a lovely child.\"\n\nPercy could see the surprise in Galaxaura's face, but she quickly composed herself and thanked Hermes. She made the gesture where she tapped lightly the hair over her left ear. It was a signal to Percy to stay quiet and let Galaxaura do the talking. They did that when they had rude client that didn't like children.\n\nHermes didn't stop there.\n\n\"I won't say a thing to my father about you keeping Percy near,\" he said.\n\n\"I wish I could do the same with my kids, but I have too many duties and am much closely watched as an Olympian.\"\n\nPercy was confused, who was Hermes' father and why was he such a jerk and didn't let Hermes see his own kids? And Hermes had won an Olympic medal in sports? Why did he wear a USP uniform then. When Hermes left, she asked Galaxaura but did not get any answers.\n\n\"Percy, I am not at liberty to tell you anything. Please don't ask questions about it and please try to forget about meeting him.\"\n\nPercy found it strange but she owed Galaxaura. Thanks to her Percy had a job that earned her a lot, was able to give her mom money so Sally didn't kill herself with overwork to try and keep both of them housed, fed and clothed. She put the incident out of her mind and eventually the memory faded. Years later, Percy would once again meet Hermes and offer him a drink and a snack. The memory would hit her like a brick.\n\nClio: I am the only family my son needsHyacinthus: I am a mama's boy\n\nIcarus: I want to be a mama's boyPasiphae: Sorry, hun, my husband is a jerk and will not let me mother another man's childArtemis: Let's see if a boy can retain his sweet nature and respect for women if I take part in raising him\n\nChloris: I am upset because my ex-husband is a slut, so I will cope with my feelings by murdering a toddler.Artemis: Killing innocent children is wrongChloris: What about Niobe's childrenArtemis: When I kill children, it is divine justice; when you do so, it is a heinous crime\n\nPercy: My mom married a smelly jerk, and I am unhappyGalaxaura: Sorry, sweetie, I can't do anything about that, but I can increase your salary\n\nHermes, Olympus' biggest snitch: Hey there, Galaxaura and a random kid that smells like the seaGalaxaura, harbouring Poseidon's taboo demigod: I now know what people caught by Homeland Security with a nuclear warhead feel likeHermes, adds two plus two and gets fiveGalaxaura, is happy to take it\n\nHyacinthus gives Camp two out of five stars. One because he can't give zero and the other one because he makes two awesome friends.\n\nIcarus realizes that life is unfair and Minos is a prideful idiot.\n\nPercy has a horror movie experience.\n\nNo one was surprised when Hyacinthus received the invitation to go to camp. And only one person didn't want him to go. His little sister Polyboea. Polyboea had just turned four to Hyacinthus twelve. Her first word was Hya, the closest approximation to Hyacithus's name and from the moment she could walk, she followed Hyacinthus around if allowed. All too often, the caretakers took the little princess back to her rooms. Prince Hyacinthus had to train in gymnastics and combat and could not indulge his baby sister all day.\n\nMaybe it was the lack of a mother, but Polyobea was utterly different from her older sisters, much more tomboyish. As Amyclas had hoped, her looks had somewhat improved as she grew older, but the king was still disappointed that she was not as cute as her sisters or half-brother had been at her age. Hyacinthus thought that his father ought to get over himself, but others told him that the prettier a girl was, the easier it was to secure her a good marriage. Queen Sparta was adamant about it. Hyacinthus shot back, saying she had many other options even if Polyboea could not marry. She could join the ranks of Artemis' priestesses or just keep living in Sparta as a princess.\n\n\"Your fondness for her blinds you, Hyacinthus.\" wistfully spoke his grandmother.\n\n\"You will one day wed, and your bride will not like having your little sister around, undermining her authority. She will make Polyboea miserable.\"\n\nHyacinthus silently thought there was a simple solution: he could not get married, but he did not say that to his grandmother. She would have lectured him on his obligation and duty to contribute to the succession, especially since it was confirmed that Hyacinthus would be king after Amyclas.\n\nLaodamia had married Arcas, the king of Arcadia and the son of Zeus and Callisto. Arcas came to ask for her hand in marriage after his first wife, Meganeira, an Eleusian princess, had died. Laodamia was not pleased that her husband already had two sons, Apheidas and Elatus, but Amyclas liked the match and its advantages.\n\nHyacithus had gone to Eleusis with Argalus to witness the nuptials. Amyclas had not wanted to leave the Kingdom for that long. Argalus had needed to take a long way back, but Hyacinthus had caught a flying chariot ride with his mother. He had been able to mull over what he had learned for Arcas' servants. His new brother-in-law had not one but two nymph lovers, indeed his father's son. The two dryads, Chrysopeliea and Erato, had several children by King Arcas. Hyacinthus knew that it did not bode well for Laodamia. He had tried to warn her and Argalus, but neither wanted to listen to him.\n\nHegesandre's husband was of far more unsavoury and infamous lineage. Argeus, prince of Elis, son of King Pelops and Queen Hippodamia. With this one, Amyclas was less than delighted since he did not want a descendant of Tantalus to be married to his family. Argeus was coming not from Elis but from Delphi, where he had received a prophecy from the Pythia that he was to marry a Spartan princess.\n\nNo one in their right mind went against the Oracle of Apollo. Amyclas accepted Argeus' suit, and to everyone's surprise, Hegesandre was very taken with her husband. Little love was lost between Hyacinthus and his second eldest half. Later, he prayed that Argeus would not take after Tantalus. As unpleasant as she could be, she did not deserve a husband who would chop up and cook their child.\n\nArgeus' courtship was not Hegesandre's first attempt at marriage. She had been supposed to be betrothed years earlier. Her prospective betrothed had arrived disguised as an artist, meaning to paint her likeness and test her character. The man had been amazed at how beautiful Hyacinthus was and insisted on painting his likeness first, enraging Hegesandre. That prince had declared her an obstinate brat and had left, disappointed that Hyacinthus was not a girl.\n\nAfter the nuptials, Hegesandre went to Elis with her husband, even further away than Laodamia. Polyboea had been frightened at the idea that one day, she might need to go further away and get married. To console her, Hyacinthus began telling her tales of the goddess Artemis, the daughter of Zeus who shunned marriage.\n\nPolyboea was fascinated and even wanted her bow and arrows. Grandmother Sparta was not pleased. While the old queen saw nothing wrong with women knowing their way around weapons, she was pretty skilled with the bow and long daggers; she firmly maintained that it was a princess's duty to marry for the benefit of her kingdom, just like she had done. Laodamia and Hegesandre had secured alliances with Arcadia and Elis, two other powerful kingdoms of the Peloponnese.\n\nFor Hyacinthus himself, Amyclas was trying to negotiate with King Acrisius of Argos. Sparta had a standing alliance with Argos since their queen was Eurydice, Amyclas's sister. She had only produced one child, Princess Danae. Amyclas hoped that if Acrisius had no sons, then the kingdoms of Laconia and Argolis would unite in a single, powerful kingdom that would forever dominate the Peloponnese.\n\nQueen Sparta was skeptical of her son's ambitions. Laconia and Argolis were very different; co-existence as a single kingdom would be impossible. She told Hyacinthus to pay it no mind; Danae was even younger than he was, and she could quickly get a brother or two by the time she was old enough to marry. Hyacinthus was to focus on going to Chiron's camp to distant Thessaly.\n\nChiron's camp was by Mount Pelion in the southeastern part of Thessaly. It would take months to reach, but fortunately, Clio would drop Hyacinthus off. Hyacinthus was not sure what to expect. Sparta was home to several demigod sons of Ares, who sang praises to the camp, but a few other demigods did not have such nice things to say--predominantly female demigods. Daughters of Aphrodite were invited regularly since they tended to have powers requiring instruction. Those demigod daughters were usually erroneously called nymphs by the masses due to their incredible beauty and also because Zeus did not like it when goddesses had affairs with mortal men.\n\nOne daughter of Aphrodite, whom Hyacinthus had met on a few formal occasions, told him that she was only going back because she wanted to get revenge on some of the people who had wronged her. Her name was Smilax, and she was the daughter of one of the wealthiest men in Sparta. Her father often threw her in Hyacinthus' path, hoping to get his daughter a queen's crown. Smilax, however, only had eyes for another Spartan, a son of Poseidon by the name of Crocus. After confirming with his mother, Hyacinthus invited the two to come with him in Clio's chariot.\n\nThey were both one year older than him and had one year already done at Chiron's camp. Neither of them were looking forward to going back. Smilax was returning for revenge, and Crocus returned because he needed to leave his grandfather's house. It took Hyacinthus a while to recall Crocus's grandfather, but what he knew of him was not good. A very foul-tempered man whose daughter had fallen pregnant out of wedlock. Even though the father was a god, Poseidon, the man almost threw his pregnant daughter out of his house. It took a localized earthquake for him to stop. But ever since, hardly anyone had seen the daughter or her son.\n\nCrocus was one year older than Hyacinthus, and it was his first time meeting the prince. Since Hyacinthus was an heir to the throne, he had been introduced to almost every well-born boy in Sparta. Crocus had also never been allowed to participate in athletic competitions or festivals or had joined the palestra with the other boys. When pressed, he confessed that it was his grandfather's doing. Hyacinthus vowed to himself that once they were back, he would ensure that Crocus got a royal invitation to every competition and festival of note. Or maybe bring him to the palace as a companion.\n\nAmyclas had been trying to get Hyacinthus to choose a few companions from the Spartides his age. Unlike the ones he had been introduced to, Crocus was not only a demigod himself but also didn't stare at Hyacinthus openmouthed and stammer when talking to him. If only Smilax had been a boy, Hyacinthus would have had two suitable companions to present to his father.\n\nClio descended her chariot by the camp and led them through to Chiron. It was not the first time Hyacinthus had seen a centaur. Many centaur bands were roaming the Peloponnese. They were savage troublemakers, as a rule. Amyclas often had to ride out with his soldiers to stop centaurs from robbing and destroying towns, villages, and grain fields. Or to rescue women they had abducted. Most of those rescued women were just hollow shells of their former selves.\n\nChiron, however, was not the usual type of centaur. He was much older, the son of the Titan Kronos and the Oceanid Philyra. While none of the elder Olympians were eager to call him brother since they saw themselves as children of Rhea rather than Kronos, Apollo taught Chiron, and in return, he taught demigods. This arrangement had been in place for hundreds of years.\n\nThe centaur had briefly taught the famous hero Bellerophon before said hero had turned to Athena's advice instead--a very unwise move for a son of Poseidon to have anything to do with Athena. No one was surprised when Bellerophon ended up like he did. Poseidon did flood Athens after his son's death, but none of his allegations against Athena stuck. Zeus ordered that they never be spoken of again. Hyacinthus only knew because of Clio and was under strict orders from his mom to never utter a word. Athena was a very self-conscious and easily riled-up goddess for all her wisdom.\n\nChiron greeted Clio, who gave him a nod and presented her son and his friends. The centaur appeared a little tense when he saw Smilax and Crocus. Smilax gave the centaur a toothy smile and inquired if all the people from last year were there. Chiron confirmed, looking momentarily discomfited before turning to converse with Clio. Both Clio and Amyclas had made generous donations to the camp. Their generosity merited Hyacinthus's private quarters. After confirming that the private quarters were spacious enough for another resident, Hyacinthus invited Crocus to stay with him. Smilax would have to stay with the other girls for propriety's sake.\n\nCrocus was happy not to stay in the barracks, and Hyacinthus soon found out why. Chiron was overworked, supervising hundreds of demigods, which meant many things slipped and fell through the cracks.\n\nAfter Clio left, Chiron assigned Crocus to show Hyacinthus around the camp. Unfortunately, the tour was interrupted several times. Hyacinthus got catcalled, and quite a few made lewd comments about him. Several sons of Ares heckled Crocus, who immediately got into a fight with them. Hyacinthus dove into the battle to help out his new friend. They all made quite a bit of noise, and Chiron arrived to check it out. The centaur blamed Crocus for the mess and tried to punish only him. Hyacinthus spoke up, telling Chiron that the Ares brats had started it, but Chiron said that Crocus resorted to violence. The centaur told Hyacinthus that Crocus had a terrible temper that he needed to control.\n\nIt was utterly unfair, but there was nothing Hyacinthus could do other than help Crocus with the extra chores assigned. He memorized the faces and names of Ares's annoying sons. Quite a few of them were from Laconia. Once he was back there, he would make their lives difficult with his authority as a prince.\n\nThe two boys checked on Smilax in the girl's area and found her harassed by Zeus's son. Crocus swore and ran towards her, ripping the older boy's hands off Smilax's arms. Hyacinthus followed, glaring at the son of Zeus.\n\n\"She enticed me!\" Whined the brat.\n\nHyacinthus punched him in the face.\n\n\"You can't hit me! My father is Zeus!\"\n\nHyacinthus snorted.\n\n\"Which means that hopefully Hera will get rid of you soon and do the world a favour.\"\n\nThat made the brat sputter even further.\n\n\"I will tell Chiron!\"\n\n\"Go right ahead.\"The brat looked at Smilax.\n\n\"Come on! You can't find better than me! I am a son of Zeus.\"\n\nSmilax gave him a disdainful look.\n\n\"Are you sure about that?\"\n\nThe boy gasped.\n\n\"My father claimed me for everyone to see!\"\n\n\"There were many people near. Maybe he aimed at someone else? You have never shown as much as a spark.\"\n\nThe possible son of Zeus screamed in rage.\n\n\"Shut up!\"\n\n\"Everyone says it. It is not just me. How are you going to shut up, everyone?\"\n\nSmilax smiled.\n\n\"You know. Someone asked the Oracle of Delphi about Medusa, and she said that only a true, brave and glorious son of Zeus can slay her. She also said that with Medusa slain, that son of Zeus would be safe from Hera and have a long, happy life as a king.\"\n\nHyacinthus could practically see the calculating thoughts in the other boy's head. When the intruder left, Hyacinthus turned to his fellow Spartans.\n\n\"What are you leaving out?\"\n\nSmilax giggled.\"It will be a son of Zeus of Spartan blood. That particular idiot is from Thebes. I don't think any Spartan-blooded sons of Zeus are currently alive. The kingdom is too close to Argos, and Hera is ever vigilant.\"The queen of the gods did have more than her fair share of temples in Sparta, thanks to Hyacinthus' late and unlamented stepmother.\n\n\"So, he is going to die?\" Asked Crocus.\n\nSmilax gave him a smile that was all teeth.\n\n\"I told you I only came here to avenge myself.\"\n\nHyacinthus had to ponder a bit. He was no stranger to unwanted attention from people his age and older. Every time someone tried to lay hands on him, he found it disgusting and removed himself from the situation. As a girl and not royalty, Smilax had it even worse. Given the boy's comments, Chiron did nothing to curb this behaviour. Hyacinthus decided to keep his mouth shut and let Smilax have her revenge.\n\nHe got used to the camp. Crocus introduced him to his brothers, who were quite rough but slightly less entitled and annoying than the sons of Zeus and Ares. Both Spartan boys observed as each son of Zeus and a few of Ares left the camp after a little conversation with a smug, satisfied Smilax. Chiron looked confused and worried, which made Smilax more smug.\n\nWhile Smilax busied herself with manipulating unsavoury brutes to their deaths, Hyacinthus was busy with something else. While his female friend did her lethal networking, there were plenty of pretty campers from humble origins who were vulnerable to predation. Hyacinthus introduced himself and organized them to unite and repel creeps better. He was certain Chiron had caught on to what they were doing, but the centaur could not stop them. Smilax was careful not to leave evidence or use her charmspeak with witnesses.\n\nChiron had noticed that the more vulnerable campers had banded together, and quite a few of the jerks ended up with very nasty injuries. But it is not like Chiron could say that the demigods not of high birth should allow themselves to be preyed upon. He punished Crocus and two of his brothers when they inflicted water torture on an Ares camper. The Apollo children were able to save his life, but his lungs and limbs were permanently damaged, making a life of seeking glory all but impossible. It is truly the worst punishment for an ambitious demigod.\n\nHyacinthus had asked Crocus what the Ares camper did, but his friend refused to tell him. One of Crocus' brothers mentioned that the Ares camper was caught trying to sneak into their quarters at night. Crocus caught him in the act while returning from his night swim in the sea. Hyacinthus recalled that he had felt unusually sleepy and tired when he went to bed and had slept like a log through the commotion. A few of the people that served food also vanished, but that seemed to be more Chiron's doing after Crocus hissed something at the centaur about King Amyclas and his armies.\n\nHyacinthus understood what had happened. The Ares camper had bribed the servants to drug his food or drink and had planned to sneak into his quarters while Crocus was out for his night swim. That night, his friend had forgotten the pouch that he usually took to collect seashells and other treasures from the sea, so he returned early that night. Hyacinthus went to the temple of Tyche and placed lavish offerings on her altar. He did the same in Poseidon's temple to thank him for having sired Crocus.\n\nAll three of them stayed in the camp for six months before returning to Sparta. Hyacinthus said his goodbyes to everyone he had befriended. The more vulnerable campers reassured him that they would keep the safety system in place. He offered Crocus' brothers a place in Sparta should they want it but none of them wanted to be that far inland and away from the sea. Smilax returned with them after pointedly commenting on how few sons of Zeus were left.\n\n \n\nTale of Icarus\n\nIn the heart of a dense forest, Icarus, who is seven years old, receives instruction on the art of hunting from Artemis, the goddess of the hunt. Three years ago, she rescued him and has since taken him under her protection and patronage. Under her stern tutelage, Icarus feels that he has made significant progress.\n\n\"Remember, Icarus,\" Artemis instructs, uttering no sound but speaking directly into his mind as it was customary for when they were hunting.\n\n\"Patience is key. Wait for the right moment to strike.\"\n\nPatience did not come naturally to him, but Artemis had managed to instill a measure of it in Icarus.\n\nIcarus nods at the goddess, readying his bow and notching an arrow. His eyes focused on the small pack of savage wolves terrorizing local herds. He loosens the first arrow with a swift movement, striking the most enormous wolf. Quickly, he loses three more arrows. The remaining wolves head towards him, and he readies his long hunting knives. With quick jumps and swift movements, he manages to take down the remaining wolves, ensuring the safety of the people's livelihood. The very same herders that had been fervently praying to Artemis.\n\nHe looks at the wolves' corpses. They are almost twice as large as ordinary wolves and drawn to people rather than preferring to run away like most wolves would. They are possibly enhanced by magic or with something unusual in their ancestry. He does not ask her. Artemis is disgusted by mentions of couplings and is not fond of magic users either. Sorcerers tend to invoke the moon in their workings despite Artemis having nothing to do with the domain of magic.\n\nArtemis, observing his success, gives him a rare nod of approval.\n\n\"Well done, Icarus.\"\n\nShe praises, healing his minor injuries with a touch of her hand.\"But remember to be more careful. You are not invincible.\"\n\nIcarus busies himself with expertly skinning the wolves under Artemis' critical eye. Wolf pelts are highly prized as trophies of one's prowess as a hunter and for their warmth in the winter.\n\nAs the day draws to a close, the sun slowly sinking on the horizon, Icarus confesses his worries to Artemis.\n\n\"Lady Artemis,\"\n\nHe begins, switching to a more formal address. The goddess raises her eyebrows.\n\n\"I am worried about Ariadne, my father, Queen Pasiphae and Crete. King Minos beseeched Lord Poseidon for approval, and Lord Poseidon sent a magnificent white bull. But Minos has no intention of honouring the sea god's generosity and graciousness by sacrificing the bull. I fear Lord Poseidon's divine wrath will fall upon Crete, and no one will be spared.\"\n\n\"When kings and queens anger gods, their children, their daughters, are punished. I don't want Ariadne to be the next Andromeda.\"\n\n\"Perseus rescued Andromeda.\" Artemis reminds him.\n\nIcarus sighs.\n\n\"He was one of the very rare demigods that got to be happy, and so did his wife. Ariadne is too young to be a bride, and she is more likely to end up like Megara than Andromeda.\"\n\nArtemis, listening to his worries, advises him.\n\n\"Icarus, you must do what you feel is right. Always honour the gods who have helped you. They will guide you in your path.\"With these words, she vanishes in a flash of light, leaving Icarus alone in the forest. Left with the skins of the fallen wolves, he bundles them up and carries them to the nearest shrine of Artemis. He dedicates the pelts on Artemis' altar as a token of his respect. Despite the goddess's counsel, he can't shake off his worries about Minos and the potential consequences of his actions.\n\nIn the lush pastures of Knossos, Icarus approaches the majestic bull sent by Poseidon. The beast stands tall and proud, its eyes reflecting the divine power of the sea god. Icarus, filled with reverence, asks.\n\n\"When will this magnificent creature be taken to Poseidon's temple for the sacrifice?\"\n\nKing Minos, Prince Androgeus, and their attendants burst into laughter as if Icarus had said some funny jest. Minos, with a dismissive wave of his bejewelled hand, says.\n\n\"We have another bull for that; Poseidon won't notice.\"\n\nIcarus, taken aback, privately thinks that Minos has lost his mind. Poseidon is a god and not a god safe to anger. Cities had been hit with devastating floods and shattering earthquakes for much less.\n\nOnce everyone has left, he attempts to lead the bull to Poseidon's temple himself. Hopefully, if the bull gets there, Poseidon will be appeased and not unleash his divine wrath on Crete.\n\nHowever, Prince Androgeus, suspecting Icarus might try something, has been watching from a distance with some friends. They burst from the bushes just as Icarus got the bull to follow by tempting the beast with some berries. The prince and his friends overpower Icarus, who does not dare to hit the king's favourite son and drag him to Minos.\n\nMinos, furious with this defiance of his authority as king but wary of making an enemy of Daedalus, Icarus' loving father, orders the boy to join the women in the gynaeceum and learn how to weave.\n\n\"You will go there daily for a month,\" Minos commands.\n\n\"And at the end of it, you must present me with a cloth you have woven, and it better fit a king!\"\n\nThe task assigned as punishment by Minos was considered women's work and thus humiliating to men. Icarus, as a diligent student of the goddess Artemis and best friend of Princess Ariadne, does not care. The people he respects the most are women, and he does not find their work humiliating. Everyone needs to wear clothes after all.\n\nUnfortunately, someone else cares. Poseidon, Icarus' maternal grandfather. Father of Icarus' late mother, the naiad Naucrate. As Icarus leaves the pasture, the bull lets out a low, mournful bellow, as if sensing the impending wrath of Poseidon. The echo of the sound lingers in the air, a chilling reminder of the consequences of dishonouring the gods.\n\nThe next day, Icarus goes to the gynaeceum to receive instructions on weaving. Ariadne is the one who takes charge of him, firmly guiding him to a loom.\n\n\"What were you thinking, defying my father!\" She hisses at him, worry and fear making her large brown eyes glassy.\n\n\"You are lucky that he needs your father.\"\n\nIcarus nods at her words, his eyes landing on Queen Pasiphae, standing by her loom but not weaving. Her eyes seem glazed with a hint of pink, her cheeks flushed, and a strange smile playing around her lips. He narrows his eyes and can almost smell rose perfume, a scent that the queen is not fond of, preferring lotuses and irises.\n\n\"Do you smell roses?\" He asks Ariadne.\n\nHis best friend pauses in her work and tentatively sniffs the air.\n\n\"There is a hint of it? I hope Mother does not get angry!\"\n\n\"It seems to be coming from your mother!\" Icarus tells her.\n\n\"She hates roses. Something weird is happening.\"\n\nAriadne wrinkles her nose.\n\n\"Don't try to distract me. You need to understand that you can't do something like this anymore! The king does not like defiance, and he never forgets or forgives a slight.\"\n\nIcarus sighed and nodded, understanding the gravity of his actions. Still, he had to try to give Poseidon his due for the sake of everyone he loved and everyone living in Crete. Ariadne lectures him on proper weaving techniques, but Icarus's attention is drawn to Queen Pasiphae.\n\nShe keeps acting strange, her movements more deliberate, and her gaze is distant. And then there's the scent - roses. Icarus wrinkles his nose. He knows fully well that the queen and her sister Circe despise the perfume of roses, reminding them of losing their father, Helios.\n\n\"Why roses?\" He wonder aloud, a terrible sense of foreboding sinking under his skin, giving him the same levels of anxiety he only felt in the cave that Artemis rescued him from.\n\nAriadne shrugs, her eyes filled with concern not just for Icarus but also for her mother. The gynaeceum, usually a place of laughter and chatter, is unusually quiet. The air is heavy with the scent of roses growing thicker and the unspoken tension of the palace.\n\nIcarus, despite his predicament, can't help but feel a pang of sympathy for the queen. He resolves to do his best in the gynaeceum, not just for his sake but for everyone in the palace affected by Minos' pride and Poseidon's wrath.\n\nAriadne, noticing his distraction, asks him about his studies with his father. Recently, Daedalus had started teaching Icarus mathematics, sciences, poetry, and philosophy. Icarus did his best to be a diligent student and make his father proud, but had little interest in the subjects. Some sciences were fun, especially the ones involved in making things. He loved making pottery and sketching scenes with his father, but mathematics bored him utterly.\n\n\"I'd rather hunt, swim and do gymnastics. But I do love pottery and sketching. Mathematics, though, bores me.\"\n\nAriadne scolds him.\n\n\"You should appreciate such an opportunity. I would do anything to be allowed to study mathematics and science.\"\n\nHer voice is tinged with longing and a hint of frustration.\n\n\"Unfortunately, no scholar is willing to teach a girl.\"\n\nIcarus looks at her, surprised.\n\n\"That's not fair,\" He says, his voice firm.\n\n\"I'll try to convince my father to teach you.\"\n\nAriadne thanks him, but her smile is sad.\n\n\"I appreciate it, Icarus, but I don't expect anything.\"\n\nAs Icarus leaves the gynaeceum that day, he can't help but think about the unfairness of it all. Why should girls be denied an education or training? And forced to stay indoors all day doing a task as repetitive and mindnumbing as weaving? It's a question that lingers in his mind, a reminder of the injustices even within the palace walls. And it's a question that he's determined to find an answer to, for Ariadne's sake.\n\nHe rushes home, where his father waits for his lessons. Icarus approaches Daedalus with a request.\n\n\"Father, I want Ariadne to join our lessons,\" He says, his voice as steady as he can keep it.\n\nDaedalus looks at him, astonished.\n\n\"Why would I waste my time teaching a girl? She will only marry and produce children. Her entire life she will spend in the women's quarters, running the household and raising her children.\"\n\nIcarus grits his teeth in frustration.\n\n\"Ariadne deservest to be educated. She is one of the smartest people that I know! It's unfair that she's denied the opportunity just because she's a girl.\"\n\nDaedalus scoffs, \"Education is for men, Icarus.\"\n\nThanks to the mishap with the bull, Icarus had the perfect retort.\n\n\"And yet, Minos is making me, a boy, learn how to weave. Isn't that supposed to be women's work?\"\n\nDaedalus' fists clench in anger, and his face twists into a fearsome scowl, gray eyes blazing with cold rage.\n\n\"Fine,\" his father grumbles,\n\n\"Ariadne can join the next lesson. But she had better study quickly, or she will be expelled.\"\n\nIcarus nods, satisfied. He knows it won't be easy, but he is determined to help Ariadne get the education she craves. He knows that Artemis will approve.\n\n \n\nModern Times\n\nPercy sat down by the door, hugging her knees. Her mom and Galaxaura were talking in the other room, and she did not know that the door was slightly open, and she could hear them.\n\n\"A catholic school? How did this even happen?\" Galaxaura wanted to know.\n\nSally Jackson sighed.\n\n\"I was baptized as a child after my parents died. I attended Catholic school for a few years, the same one until the clear sight got too much. My uncle relented and put me in a regular school. It seems that the administration assumes that Percy was baptized.\"\n\n\"She hasn't? Correct?\" There seemed to be fear in Galaxaura's voice.\n\n\"Of course not!\" Her mom spoke.\n\n\"Oh, thank Thalassa and Pontus. I can't imagine how furious Poseidon would have been. His sacred pine tree gets devastated during Christmas, and he loathes the concept.\"\n\nSally snorted.\n\n\"I know; I use a fake tree for a reason. I would prefer to go without, but Gabriel would get suspicious, and Percy has enough trouble without being the kid whose family does not even celebrate Christmas.\"\n\nPercy was starting to suspect that her mother and her agent were followers of the Hellenistic religion. She had seen posts about it on social media. Models and influencers praying to Aphrodite for beauty and grace. During flu season, people prayed to Apollo and Asclepius. It was a niche movement but present. Galaxaura had mentioned it several times and was always excited when she saw such a post. Percy now knew the reason why. Well, she would go to the catholic schools since she had no choice, but she would avoid taking communion or praying in the attached church.\n\nPercy was already less than enthusiastic about Catholic school, but the reality was even worse than she expected. The nuns realized that her mother had her before marriage and would not stop lecturing Percy about the evil of such sin. She shot back that if God was truly offended by her existence, then surely Percy would not have existed. That shut them up for a few moments before they started lecturing her on being disrespectful.\n\nThe other students took cues from the nasty nuns and either ignored Percy utterly or tried to make fun of her. Percy couldn't care less if they insulted her alone, but it was another matter when the foul little brats thought that they could insult her mom.\n\nOne of them, Patricia, called Percy's mom a slut. Percy dragged her to a secluded area, beat the girl bloody, and threatened to skin her alive and dunk her in saltwater if she ever repeated the same. Percy snatched Patricia's phone and took down her address so she could get revenge if the other girl opened her mouth. Percy needed to last at least one year in this cursed school before she got expelled.\n\nPatricia told the administration that she had just fallen down the stairs. It was clear that no one believed her, but she kept insisting in an increasingly desperate voice. The whole time Percy was there, Patricia didn't dare even look at her. There was a part of Percy that she buried deep in her soul for the sake of her mom that took joy in Patricia's fear of her.\n\nThe following months were lonely, but at least the nuns had stopped criticizing her mom. The problem was the priest. He kept trying to give her communion after his boring sermons, but Percy claimed to be allergic to grapes and could not take it. The priest was instantly suspicious because it was not in Percy's file. She told him it was a mild reaction but did not want to suffer the discomfort. The kind, loving and benevolent god Father Lucas described daily in his very long sermons would not want a little girl to suffer. Percy was called impertinent and assigned detention.It was not the end of it. Father Lucas started talking to the nuns. They were constantly whispering with each other while looking and pointing at Percy. She wished that they would stop doing that. Not only was it rude, but it was making the other students even more obnoxious. Percy needed to last one year in this hellhole. December had barely started.\n\nThe day before they left for the Christmas holidays, Sister Margaret came to collect her. Percy's heart sank. Were they expelling her? She noticed that the nun looked rather pale and her hands were shaking. She threw puzzling looks at Percy and always seemed on the verge of saying something.\n\nTo her surprise, Sister Margaret did not take her to the offices but to the church instead. There Father Lucas and two more nuns were waiting. Father Lucas was holding his little bowl of grape juice soaked wafers.\n\n\"Percy, you must take the communion. It's part of our faith,\" Sister Margaret implored her.\n\nPercy shrank away. In addition to her mom's and Galaxaura's worries. Being inside a church felt instinctively wrong for her. Her skin itched with anxiety and she always felt nauseous. She was sure that if she tried to eat those wafers she would vomit.\n\n\"It have told you many times! I can't take that. I am allergic to grapes. And at this point I don't want too!\"\n\nFather Lucas scowled and interjected.\n\n\"Percy, if you refuse the communion, it's a sign of the devil's influence. We must cleanse you.\"\n\nThe other two nuns seized her and dragged her to a chair where they secured her with ropes.\n\n\"Have you gone crazy! There is no such thing as the devil! This is illegal!\"Sister Margaret wrung her hands, a look of discomfort on her face but she stayed silent and still.\n\n\"The devil exists and his greatest victory is making others believe that he does not.\" Pompously spoke Father Lucas.\n\n\"You are going to end up in jail just like the rest of the crazy priests!\" Percy hissed, thrashing in the chair and trying to get free.\n\nNone of them answered, the priest started chanting while holding a crucifix and nuns doused him with holy water. It was December, no snow had fallen yet but it was bitterly cold. Most of her classmates huddled near the heaters and aways wore gloves and scarves. Percy was not bothered. The cold had never bothered her much. Galaxaura had noticed and murmured something about the icy temperatures at the bottom of the sea.\n\nAs terrifying and confusing as this situation was, Percy was not worried about the water. It had a strange texture, both slimy and gritty like all tap water but it did not hurt her. She would have vastly preferred that it was salt water with its delightful minerals. Some freshwater came close but none could be as pleasant on the skin and nose as seawater.\n\n\"It's freezing, Father. Shouldn't we stop? She will get hypothermia!\" Sister Margaret asked, concerned. She looked at Percy with fear, biting her lips.\n\n\"No, the devil is resilient. We must try fire,\" Father Lucas decided.\n\nHe grabbed a stick, resembling a cheerleaders batton, except that when he turned a stitch, the end if erupted in fire. Father Lucas smiled and approached Percy with the flaming torch. She shrank back in the chair and felt a tug in her gut.\n\nSuddenly, the water exploded, and the ground shook violently. The priest and the two nuns were thrown away from Percy. The church crumbled around them.\n\nPercy's struggles against the ropes bore fruit, she managed to free herself and ran out, leaving the priest and the nuns trapped inside. She shouted for Sister Margaret to run but had no consideration to spare for the other two nuns and that vile priest.\n\nShe run to the offices to tell the administration what the priest had done. The headmaster listened to her with a strange look on his face as Percy explained. He told her to go back to her dormitory and that he would sort this out.\n\nPercy went to bed with hopeful thoughts but the next morning she was disappointed. The school expelled her without explanation. She was left with more questions than answers about what had happened. Percy wondered if she should ask her mother.\n\nWhen Sally arrived, she looked so beside herself with fear that Percy decided against asking questions. They just packed Percy's things and headed out. By the gates there was a car waiting. Percy expected Galaxaura, but she did not expect her boyfriend there as well. She could never quite catch his name, Ant something, most likely Anthony but everytime she tried to clarify something stoped her. She looked at him, he had unruly black hair like her and almost the same green eyes. Percy's eyes rolled back and she slumped in the car seat.\n\nSally gasped and clutched her daughter.\n\n\"Don't worry, I just put her to sleep.\" Anteros spoke.\n\n\"You told me that she was yours but she was descended from my father.\" Anteros accused Galaxaura.\n\nThe Oceanid shrugged.\n\n\"I did not lie. Her father entrusted her to me. I am officially her guardian so the child is mine in the legal sense. And she definitely is descended from your father.\"\n\nAnteros scowled.\n\n\"I was imagining at least a great granddaughter! Not his actual demigod daughter, my sister!\"\n\nGalaxaura patted his arm.\n\n\"The less people know the better it will be. You are on Olympus almost all the time.\"\n\n\"This is going to be such a mess. The destruction of that church was noticed. It ended on Olympus Weekly.\"\n\nSally gasped.\n\n\"Are they going to find her?\" She grabbed her daughter's hand.\n\nAnteros shook his head.\n\n\"No, because I was nearby everyone thinks that I did it. I have not denied it.\"\n\n\"So Percy is safe?\"\n\n\"For now.\"\n\nHe looked at Sally seriously.\n\n\"You need to avoid her getting in highly emotional or dangerous situations. If she discovers her powers she will realize what she is an the monsters will be even more drawn to her. The rest of them might notice too. My uncle is angry about what happened to his daughter. He will not take it well that my father's daughter is alive and has been living in safety.\"\n\nSally glanced at her daughter, blue eyes shiny with fear. Galaxaura noticed ad sighed.\n\n\"Lets just take it one day at the time.\"\n\n\"My father might retaliate against this place.\" Anteros warned.\n\n\"Can you talk him out? It will only draw more attention here.\"\n\n\"I will try, but I make no promises.\"\n\nPercy woke up. Galaxaura was on her phone, arguing with someone. Her boyfriend was driving the car while singing along. Percy looked at the screen, it was a spotify list of love songs. She rolled her eyes, adults were all the same. Love this and that. She turned to her mom. Percy wanted to say that she was sorry that she did not last the year in the school. Her mom stopped her from saying anything by hugging her.\n\n\"Percy, I am so sorry! I should have never taken you to that school.\"\n\n\"It's ok mom. I know how it is.\" Percy murmured on her mom's shoulder.\n\nHyacinthus and his family have become a trending topic.\n\nIcarus learns bullfighting on the go\n\nPercy meets a goat and a horse\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nHyacinthus returned to Sparta with Crocus and Smilax in tow. Amyclas was happy to receive his son back and had some news for him. While Hyacinthus had been away, many things had happened. Betrothals had been arranged for Argalus and Cynortas to local young women of high status. However, these weddings would not take place until Amyclas himself was wed.\n\nPeople had been trying to compel King Amyclas to marry again the moment the late Queen Diomede's corpse had grown cold. But they had all been rebuffed. Amyclas had needed a long break after his first marriage. He would have stayed unmarried until his death if it had been up to him. He had four healthy sons; there was no need for a bride.\n\nHowever, Amyclas received an offer he could not refuse--one from a god. Ares, the god of war, had a demigod daughter in Laconia. Her name was Aristodamia, and she was quite beautiful. Amyclas had accepted her as a bride, and she had arrived in the palace to prepare for her role as queen.\n\nNot wanting to deal with a second Diomede, Hyacinthus was polite and kind to her when introduced. He even introduced her to his friends, Crocus and Smilax.\n\nAristodamia was happy enough to greet him and even Crocus. But when she caught sight of Smilax, her smile fell.\n\n\"Aren't you quite beautiful?\" She told Smilax, teeth bared.\n\n\"A daughter of Aphrodite?\" Being a demigod, she did not mistake Smilax for a nymph or pretend to do so, as a regular mortal would.\n\n\"I attended camp myself a few years back. I met a few of your sisters.\"\n\nSmilax gave the future queen a sweet smile that immediately alerted Hyacinthus. He knew his friend. That was the smile she gave enemies when assessing them and wanting to downplay her threat level.\n\n\"I hope you had a better time at camp than we did, my lady,\" Smilax told Aristodamia sweetly.\n\nThe king's betrothed smiled insincerely before turning to Hyacinthus.\n\n\"Your father, the king, decided to postpone our wedding for a few weeks because he wants to hold a celebration for your thirteenth birthday first.\"\n\nHyacinthus frowned. It was not quite necessary to do that. It was the fifteenth birthday when he would finally be considered a man by Spartan law that mattered.\n\n\"I will talk to him about that. The king's wedding needs to be a priority. And the eldest and second eldest princes weddings too. This is just my thirteenth, not the fifteenth.\"\n\nAristodamia looked at him up and down and licked her lips as she focused on his face.\n\n\"Ah, yes. In two years, you will be a man.\" She told him in a throaty voice with a languid smile.\n\nHyacinthus barely repressed the urge to step away from her. He looked at his friends. Crocus had an expression of disgust on his face--the same one he had when someone commented about Hyacinthus's looks. Smilax had the same pleasant expression, but her eyes were blazing with wrathful fire.\n\nHyacinthus decided to take his leave of his stepmother-to-be and took his friends to the gardens that overlooked his private quarters, far away from any eavesdroppers.\n\n\"What is the matter, Smilax? What is wrong with her?\"\n\nCrocus growled, and Smilax gave a very unhappy sigh. She pursed her lips, deep in thought, before she spoke.\n\n\"She is the most lustful woman that I have met, save for my mother. I could sense it on her. She was resisting the urge to feel you up. Crocus, too, but to a lesser degree. I think you are safe from her now, but she might try something by the time you are fifteen.\"\n\nCrocus made a face.\n\n\"She might try what Queen Anteia of Tiryns tried with my brother Bellerophon.\"\n\nHyacinthus sighed in unhappy resignation. Disliking the mention of that ill-fated son of Poseidon, it had not been that long since his passing.\n\n\"Welcome to the royal palace and the king's court. It's a pit of vipers. Last chance to leave and not get involved in this mess.\"\n\nSmilax shook her head and gave him a rueful smile. Crocus a look of surly disbelief.\n\n\"Fat chance.\" Were Crocus' only words.\n\n\"I like hunting vipers,\" Smilax told him with a naughty smile.\n\nHyacinthus secured invitations for them and their families to the upcoming celebrations and escorted them home. They had discussed this at camp. Smilax's father might betroth her to the highest bidder, so they had to pretend that Hyacinthus was an option until Crocus established himself and became a more suitable suitor for Smilax.\n\nWith that, Hyacinthus had to throw himself in the wedding preparations. It would take place during Hera's sacred month, the first month of the year, to ensure maximum blessings for the marriage. He helped his father incorporate the bride's dowry with the rest of the royal family's wealth. Ares had been quite generous, maybe too generous in Hyacinthus' opinion.\n\nHe watched Aristodamia like a hawk and told his grandmother about what Smilax had said. Queen Sparta was skeptical, but she agreed to have her new daughter-in-law carefully watched.\n\nThe wedding was magnificent; no expense was spared since it was the marriage of a king. Aristodamia looked radiant as long as Amyclas was not near her. Hyacinthus caught her eyeing him, Crocus, his brothers and a few guards, but the new queen stayed composed for the most part.\n\nTrue to her word, Grandmother Sparta watched Aristodamia carefully for several months. The new queen was the picture of decorum the whole time, except for a few long looks. Queen Sparta relaxed her vigilance since it took energy, time, and resources to be better used elsewhere.\n\nHyacinthus would have picked up the slack, but he and Crocus got busy. They were demigods trained by Chiron, meaning they had more responsibilities. They trained daily with the rest of the warriors and often were sent to kill monsters, bandits, and other nuisances in a lawful kingdom. They also had lots of competitions to participate in. Hyacinthus was well established, but Crocus had been kept locked up in the house by his resentful grandfather. He needed to prove himself to the other Spartans.\n\nThat same grandfather had fallen off a cliff and drowned in the Eurotas River. Hyacinthus convinced Amyclas to grant the properties to Crocus, which his mother would manage until her son came of age. Hyacinthus first met Crocus's mother at the funeral. She was a very beautiful woman who was deeply relieved to see her father dead. There was tension between her and Crocus, but they loved one another.\n\nQueen Aristodamia fell pregnant, and everyone rejoiced. Months later, she gave birth to a daughter whom she insisted on naming Daphne. King Amyclas allowed it, much to everyone's discomfort. Daphne was not a lucky name to give to a little girl. Aristodamia expressed her disappointment that little Daphne was not a boy and happily passed her daughter to nursemaids and did the bare minimum as a mother.\n\nHyacinthus visited the baby girl a few times and brought Smilax with him. His friend eyed the baby, carefully inspecting her.\n\n\"The princess does not seem to resemble the king at all,\" Smilax spoke, her face pale.\n\nHyacinthus peered closer at little Daphne.\n\n\"She is still a baby. I take mostly after my mother, too.\"\n\nSmilax turned to inspect him.\n\n\"True, but you do have small hints of your father. You have the same body type as the king and the same smile.\"\n\nHyacinthus swallowed thickly. If Smilax's concerns were correct, it would bring immense shame to Sparta.\n\n\"Nothing we can do now.\" He told her.\n\n\"Except watch your stepmother.\" Smilax was unamused, and Hyacinthus sighed.\n\n\"I asked Grandmother, but after several months of perfect behaviour, she stopped because treating the Queen of Sparta like that is improper. I can't watch her myself for the same reason and am too busy.\"\n\nSmilax exalted, looking fatigued and worried.\n\n\"Let us pray that it does not end up in disaster.\"\n\nTheir prayers went unanswered because shortly after Daphne turned one year old, Aristodamia was caught in the act. The queen of Sparta was caught committing adultery towards her husband, the king, and thus high treason against the kingdom.\n\nIt would have been an unprecedented disaster even if it had not been for the location where it took place and the person who caught her.\n\nAristodamia was caught defiling the temple of Hera that her predecessor, Queen Diomede, had built. Thus, in the heart of Sparta, a scandal of divine proportions unfolded. Hera, the goddess of marriage and queen of the gods, had caught Aristodamia, the young Spartan queen and the second wife of King Amyclas, committing adultery in her sacred temple.\n\nHera's fury was a fierce as a tempest.\n\n\"Spartans!\" she thundered, her voice echoing through the city, compelling everyone to head quickly toward her temple.\n\n\"Bear witness to this disgrace!\" She pointed the young queen and handsome guard entangled with each other. Prompting gasps or outrage from all witnesses.\n\nHyacinthus' father, King Amyclas, was livid with his young wife. He glared at her with hatred, his hand dropping to his sword. Yet, Aristodamia stood up, defiant.\n\nShe announced to everyone that she was a mere twenty years old, wedded to a man nearly three decades her senior. As if that was not enough of an insult, Amyclas' heart did not belong to Aristodamia. But to the Muse Clio, the other of Amyclas' favoured son, Prince Hyacinthus.\n\nHera slapped the defiant queen down, her eyes blazing with divine rage and addressed her with utter contempt.\n\n\"Amyclas has not committed an outrage against me, Aristodamia. But you have,\"\nWith those words, Hera summoned a divine fire that consumed Aristodamia and her handsome lover. The two screamed and thrashed for what seemed an eternity while no one present dared even to twitch.\n\nOnce the deed was done and all left was ashes, Hera turned to Amyclas.\n\n\"You will strike Aristodamia from all records. She was an affront to all good queens, wives, and women. She is not even to exist anymore.\"\n\nAmyclas went on one knee before the queen of the gods and nodded in acceptance.\n\n\"My temple,\" The goddess continued.\n\n\"Is now polluted by her actions and must be dismantled. Purify the site and build a grander one in its place.\"\n\nAmyclas, his face ashen, nodded again.\n\n\"Your terms are accepted, Lady Hera.\"\n\nHera departed with a final, piercing look, leaving the king with his thoughts.\n\nTurning to his son, Hyacinthus, Amyclas gave his command.\n\n\"Hyacinthus, the task of dealing with the temple falls to you. Make it worthy of Hera's grace.\"\n\nHyacinthus, however, had another concern.\n\n\"What of Aristodamia's little daughter? Princess Daphne?\"\n\nAmyclas' face and response were cold.\n\"She is no daughter of mine nor a princess of Sparta. Just the spawn of an adulterous whore and her lover. Let her be exposed to the wild animals, as is the fate of all unwanted children.\"\n\nHyacinthus had to remind him of the reason his father married Aristodamia in the first place. Because she was the daughter of a god, and that god was fond enough of her to get her a queen's crown. While Ares could do nothing about Aristodamia's fate, since it was decreed by his own mother, he could take offense in Daphne was not dealt with carefully.\n\n\"Remember, father, Aristodamia's father is the god of war, Ares. He may take offence if his granddaughter is killed. We already have one Olympian who is unhappy with us. The Furies may also be offended if a child born in your household and under your name is killed.\"\n\nAmyclas gave him an impatient look as he stomped on the ashes. People were thankfully leaving. Hyacinthus continued.\n\n\"I suggest we give the girl to a peasant family far from Sparta.\"\n\nAmyclas considered his son's words. After a moment, he nodded.\n\n\"Very well, Hyacinthus. See to it.\"\n\nAs a dutiful prince, Hyacinthus sprang into action. He immediately went to Sparta's first stone mason and commanded them to dismantle the temple. They obeyed immediately and abandoned all other projects. They understood that appeasing the angry goddess was a priority to avoid further disaster in their kingdom.\n\nNext, Hyacinthus visited the treasury. Building temples was expensive, and he needed to know his budget before making plans. There, he discovered that Aristodamia's generous dowry was mostly untouched. He would use most of it to rebuild the temple. Satisfied that he had enough funds, he turned his attention to his little stepsister.\n\nWhile he felt pity for the little girl who had done nothing wrong, Hyacinthus understood that she could not stay in Sparta to remind everyone of the disgrace her mother had committed. It would not be safe for her. He needed to get her out of the kingdom immediately before someone got the idea of killing the child.\n\nHe asked around and found a group of merchants from Argos. He entrusted the girl to them and paid them proper compensation for their trouble.\n\n\"Find a childless family for her on your way back,\" he instructed them.\n\n\"And remember, she is Ares' granddaughter. Be honest about it, and don't leave her to the mercy of wild animals, or you might get gored by a boar.\"\n\nThe leader swallowed in fear and reassured Hyacinthus that nothing of that sort would happen. The prince gave him a grave look before handing the girl over. To his surprise, the girl had not cried. She was eerily silent and watched him with huge eyes.\n\nReluctantly, Hyacinthus tore his eyes from her and walked away. He had tasks, wrongs to right and his family's honour to restore. Hyacinthus idly wondered if this was what all fourteen-year-old princes had to deal with or if it was just his rotten luck.\n\nTo distract from scandal, Amyclas decided it was time to hold the long-delayed weddings of Argalus and Cynortas. Nothing held attention like a royal wedding. Soon, to Hyacinthus' relief, people stopped whispering about Aristodamia and started speculating about the upcoming marriages and the bride's looks. It amazed him how easily distracted people were, not just in the demigod sense of being aware of everything around them. A queen of Sparta was caught betraying her husband and king in Hera's temple, but all it took to shift the rumours to a different topic was a royal wedding. Hyacinthus mentioned to his friends. Crocus was quite astonished, too, but Smilax wasn't.\n\nThe first to arrive was Argalus' bride, Parthenia. Amyclas wanted to make a good impression on the new in-laws, so he ordered the royal family to greet them. They were to be at their best. Hyacinthus was busy constructing Hera's temple and asked to be excused, but Amyclas would not hear it. He reminded Hyacinthus that he was the crown prince and needed to be present. So he had to be there, carefully bathed, exfoliated, his bronzed skin oiled and glowing. Bedecked in his finest chiton and bejewelled. His hair was carefully styled.\n\nHe made quite the impression but on the wrong person. The bride's eyes lit upon him, and she let out a whoop of joy, rushing to Hyacinthus and exclaiming how delighted she was to marry him. He scrambled away from her in alarm, cursing his damned luck and hoping that Amyclas did not change the groom.\n\n\"I am not your bridegroom! I am his younger brother!\" Hyacinthus desperately pointed to Argalus, who glared at him as if he had stolen his bride. Hyacinthus glared back at him, it was not his intention to enchant the bride! He looked desperately at his eldest brother and his father to do something, but both had frozen in place.\n\nParthenia looked at Argalus and then at Hyacinthus with an obstinate expression.\n\n\"Let's change the groom then. It does not matter which Spartan Prince I marry.\"\n\nAmyclas finally found his voice, his face red with anger and humiliation. He eyed his new daughter-in-law with the same contempt he had leveled on his second queen.\n\n\"That is enough! You will wed Argalus as negotiated. Hyacinthus has not even turned fifteen, and you are older than him!\"\n\nParthenia wailed, tears falling down her cheeks, but her blushing and humiliated father backhanded her across her face, making her flinch and fall quiet. Her tears continued to fall. Hyacinthus felt hollow with guilt. He caught Smilax's gaze, and she gave him a rueful shake. Parthenia did not miss the glance between Hyacinthus and Aphrodite's daughter because she started to glare defiantly, misunderstanding the situation.\n\nSparta had yet another delicious scandal to celebrate, along with the royal wedding, which went as planned. Too much cattle and other wealth had passed hands for it to be called off as Argalus wanted. The celebrations were stilted, and everyone kept looking at the bride and Hyacinthus. The prince knew that he would need to be careful from now on and steer very clear of his sister-in-law. They did not need another scandal.\n\nUnfortunately, Harpalus did not understand the assignment. The moment the wedding was over, and the bride and groom ushered to their marital quarters, the third prince announced to the remaining royals that he would be leaving Sparta to travel the world. Amyclas did not agree and demanded to know why Harpalus wanted to leave.\n\n\"There is no place for me here. Father, I might have had a place if you had not dallied with a muse and produced him.\"\n\nHarpalus glared at Hyacinthus with loathing. Amyclas was not deterred.\n\n\"You are a prince, Harpalus!\" Amyclas shouted.\n\n\"You have no idea what it is like for someone to live without status and means. Every meal has been prepared, and others have washed and mended your clothes. How are you going to survive?\"\n\nHarpalus grabbed a goblet and threw it at a wall. The spilled honey wine left a yellow stain on the goblet.\n\n\"At least I will be free. No one will be comparing me to a demigod every moment of the day!\"\n\n\"Why do you have so much trouble with your footwork, the trainer always tells me. Your younger brother could do this flawlessly when he was a small child. Why aren't you as beautiful as your brother? The girls I try to court tell me.\"\n\n\"I don't care where I go as long as there is no Hyacinthus. I know that you don't care about me or my siblings because you hated our mother!\"\n\nAmyclas did not answer his third son, and Hyacinthus felt a vice grip of guilt and regret around his throat. But he doubted they would do any good even if he could get any words out.\n\n\"Your muse is never coming back to you, Father. The gods don't love mortals. They just take their pleasure, use us and then leave us heartbroken! Just as they did with you!\"\n\nHarpalus then looked directly at Hyacinthus and gave him a vicious smile.\n\n\"As pretty as you are, as pretty as Adonis was, you will end just like him!\"\n\nEveryone flinched. That felt very much like a curse.\n\n\"Harpalus! Do not curse your brother!\" Amyclas screamed, his face going pale.\n\n\"If you want to leave, then leave. But you are not a prince of Sparta anymore. If you leave the city, you are never to come back!\"\n\nThat was a king's command. Harpalus nodded and left the megaroon. Hyacinthus also left, his legs taking him to the half-constructed temple of Hera. He looked at the shell of what would be a beautiful temple in a few months.\n\n\"Should I even be in charge of making a temple to the goddess of marriage and family? I destroyed a marriage by being born, another one today before it began, and I destroyed a family. Driving a son and a brother away.\"\n\nThe prince sighed, playful wind whipping around him, almost as if trying to console him, caressing his hair and ruffling his robes. Hyacinthus frowned. The wind felt almost intrusive. Apprehensive, he hurried inside the temple. There, the wind no longer bothered him. He busied himself inspecting several artisans building a mosaic depicting Hera and her husband, resplendent on their thrones, with their symbols of power.\n\nHyacinthus smiled ruefully at the image. Maybe, just maybe, marriages and families were doomed to fail. The goddess of marriage could not stop her husband from constantly betraying her. Neither could she stop her family from harming one another.\n\n \n\nTale of Icarus:\n\nIcarus fletched an arrow as Ariadne paced outside of her mother's rooms. They could hear the queen's screams of agony. They were both worried. Pasiphae had not struggled this much with little Phaedra. King Minos had stopped by, but being told it would be long before the queen gave birth, he left to attend court affairs. Icarus felt it was rather cold of him to stay away while his wife and queen struggled to give birth, but Icarus was no royal.\n\n\"Something is wrong,\" Ariadne spoke.\n\n\"She should have been done by now.\"\n\nIcarus put his arrow in the quiver.\n\n\"The queen is an immortal goddess and will be fine.\"\n\nAriadne sat next to him.\n\n\"But my sibling isn't. And might not be.\"\n\nIcarus recalled what Artemis had told him about childbirth. It was very dangerous. The women's battlefield, she called it. It could last for days, with the mother slowly bleeding in agony with no guarantee that she and the babe would make it. Since the birth of Artemis' nephew Asclepius, it had become a habit to cut the child out after a certain amount of time so that at least one could be saved. But that practice left motherless children, who often died in infancy due to the nurses not prioritizing them and giving them enough milk. Animal milk was never enough. Regarding demigods, a drop of nectar could be added to goat's milk, sustaining them. But nectar would burn out a fully mortal child. Artemis had given Icarus a vial of nectar in case he ran into a motherless or abandoned demigod child.\n\nPasiphae's screams finally stopped, and Ariadne and Icarus jumped on their feet. They could hear nothing, no cries from the baby, no congratulations from the midwives and nurses. The two friends looked at one another, worry etched on their faces. Icarus started to rise slowly and helped Ariadne to her feet. They walked to the entrance of the queen's bedroom, fearful of what lay inside.\n\nMinos had posted a guard to alert him when he needed to come and see the new child. The guard had been daydreaming, but he snapped to attention when he saw the princess and the inventor's son move. He ran to alert his king and missed the screams from the delivery room.\n\nWith bated breath, Icarus and Ariadne walked inside the dimly lit chamber. The air was thick with anticipation and fear. Suddenly, a cry echoed through the room, not the cry of a newborn child, but a guttural, monstrous roar that sent chills down their spines. Their eyes widened in horror as they beheld the creature Queen Pasiphae had birthed - a monster. It had the lower body of a human infant if human infants were covered in coarse fur. The head was that of a calf. Icarus swallowed, stepping in front of his friend.\n\nThe chamber doors swung open with a loud crack, and King Minos stormed in, ready to see the new child. His proud smile fell into a fierce scowl when his eyes fell upon the monstrous infant. His face contorted in fury as he glared at his queen with disgust and rage.\n\n\"Who is responsible for this abomination!?\" he demanded, his voice echoing ominously in the chamber.\n\nPasiphae, exhausted yet defiant, met his gaze head-on.\n\n\"It was Poseidon's doing,\" She confessed.\n\n\"Angered by your arrogance, he enchanted me to mate with his white bull.\"\n\nMinos recoiled, and Icarus could almost see the barest hint of regret, but the king recovered, and his fury was unabated.\n\n\"You have ruined my reputation!\" he accused, pointing a trembling finger at his wife.\n\nPasiphae defended herself, her voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"It was not my choice, Minos. I was but a pawn in the hands of the gods.\"\n\n\"If I had sold the gifts of Aphrodite, given my body in secret to some man, you would have every right to condemn me as a whore. But this was no act of the will! I am suffering from some madness brought on by a god. It's not plausible! What could I have seen in a bull to assault my heart with this shameful passion? Did he look too handsome in his robe? Did a sea of fire smoulder in his eyes? Was it the red tint of his hair, his dark beard?\"\n\nIcarus knew she was right but would still be responsible for what had happened. The gods were never held accountable for their actions. He had heard the tale of Callisto. The only one who had done wrong was Zeus, but the ill-fated huntress had been punished instead. She was still a monstrous bear somewhere, and Zeus was still king of the gods.\n\nPolyboea had been the one to tell him that tale since she was connected. Her sister Laodamia married Callisto's son Arcas and was his queen until her death. Polyboea looked sad as she told him about her sister but did not weep. Not like she did when her brother Hyacinthus came up. Whenever they were together and chanced upon a hyacinth flower, Polyboea would utter a sound of despair and clutch Icarus close, begging him not to die too. It was confusing, but all the immortals were strange.\n\nMinos did not listen to the pleas of his queen, just like no one had listened to Callisto's pleas. Unable to bear the sight of the monstrous infant and his wife, the king stormed out of the chamber in disgust, leaving Pasiphae with her monstrous infant.\n\nIcarus and Ariadne watched as Pasiphae, with a mother's love, attempted to breastfeed the creature. Ariadne, moved by the scene, stepped forward, but Icarus held her back. His instincts screamed danger, and he knew they must keep their distance from the Minotaur. This could not be a docile creature. Poseidon was too angry at Minos for that.\n\nIcarus's instincts were proven right only one year after the birth of the Minotaur. Pasiphae had named him Asterion, but only she called that. To everyone else, he was the Minotaur, much to the king's rage. The creature had grown to the size of a man, and its monstrous form was a constant reminder of the divine retribution that had befallen the royal family.\n\nOne fateful day, while Icarus and Ariadne were in the palace gardens, the Minotaur broke free from its confinement. It had been a wonderful day. There was hardly a cloud in the sky, and the sunshine was perfect. They had been discussing Prince Androgeus' upcoming travel to Athens to participate in the games and make a name for himself and Crete. As the heir, he had to. What had befallen them had caused Minos and his family to become a laughingstock.\n\nAriadne's older sisters, the princesses Acacallis and Xenodice, were of age to marry. Still, no one wanted to do so despite their beauty as daughters of their mother and wealth as daughters of their father. No one wanted to have the risk of being cuckolded by an animal. Princess Xenodice did not seem to care and wanted to become a priestess and fade into obscurity, but vain Acacallis did. She had several screaming matches with her mother and had not spoken to the queen for nearly a year.\n\nThe beast rampaged across the palace grounds, its roars echoing. Servants and guards fell before it, their screams of terror abruptly silenced as the Minotaur feasted on their flesh. Icarus and Ariadne watched in horror, frozen in place, as the beast turned its gaze towards them. Ariadne let out a small scream of terror, drawing its attention further.\n\nIcarus' instincts and hunter training kicked in in the face of imminent danger. He grabbed Ariadne's red himation and waved it in front of the beast, using it as a distraction. The Minotaur, drawn to the vibrant colour, so similar to freshly spilled blood, charged towards the boy, its eyes focused on the himation.\n\nWith a swift movement, Icarus moved the red cloth out of the beast's path, causing it to stumble and fall into one of the deep ponds that dotted the queen's garden and was home to her beloved lotuses. The water splashed around the beast, its roars of frustration muffled by the water.\n\nWithout wasting a moment, Icarus scooped Ariadne into his arms and ran as fast as he could towards his father's house, leaving the floundering beast behind. His heart thundered in his chest, the terror fueling his escape. As they reached the safety of Daedalus' home, they dared to breathe, their relief palpable. They stayed there, barricading themselves until Daedalus himself came home. The first thing Daedalus did after ensuring that his son was unharmed was pour himself wine and drink it without cutting it with water first. Icarus gasped.\n\n\"Father! You must add water to that or risk Dionysus's madness falling upon you!\"\n\nDaedalus obliged with his next cup.\n\n\"The king feels inspired by the beast's rampage. He ordered me to build a labyrinth to keep it contained.\"\n\nIcarus frowned.\n\n\"Is he not going to kill it?\"\n\nDaedalus shook his head.\n\n\"No, he will not. I don't think anyone can. Several guards and warriors tried but they failed. The queen managed to pacify it with her magic and he is being kept trapped in a room near her. It will not last, I will need to be quick about building the labyrinth. The queen has agreed to help me so we can add magic to it and make it safer.\"\n\n\"Why doesn't the king want to kill it? He is a son of Zeus and you one of Athena. If you worked together surely you could kill a beast barely one year old? I can ask a few of the huntresses to assist you?\" Icarus asked.\n\nDaedalus glanced at Ariadne before speaking in a softer tone.\n\n\"The king has decided to use the monster as a weapon of terror. He will feed all his enemies to the Minotaur. He already threw several of the nobles that spread the rumours about the bull and the queen to the beast.\"\n\nIcarus and Ariadne looked at each other, this did not bode well. Daedalus left after hugging his son and taking a quick meal. He told Icarus to avoid the palace and go in the woods to keep company with Artemis and the huntresses. Icarus wanted to object but Daedalus pleaded him to please keep himself safe for the sake of his dead mother.\n\n\"Ariadne? Do you want to come with me? Lady Artemis always likes to hear me speak about you.\"\nModern times\n\nPercy Jackson trudged up the steps of Yancy Academy, her backpack heavy with textbooks and a sense of impending doom. It was yet another school where she didn't quite fit in. Her dyslexia and ADHD had always made her an outsider, and she had a knack for attracting trouble. But she was determined to keep his head down and survive this time. Her mom did not need to have another fight with the school board and struggle to find her another school.\n\nOn her first day, Percy was in the cafeteria, scanning the room for a friendly face. That's when she saw Grover Underwood. Grover sat alone at a corner table, his crutches leaning against the wall. His legs were twisted, and he moved with a slow, deliberate grace. Percy hesitated for a moment, then decided to join him.\n\n\"Hey,\" Percy said, sliding into the seat across from Grover. \"Mind if I sit here?\"\n\nGrover looked up, surprise flickering across his face. \"Sure. No one ever wants to sit with the cripple.\"\n\nPercy winced at the bluntness but appreciated Grover's honesty. \"I'm Percy,\" she said. \"New kid.\"\n\n\"Grover,\" Grover replied, extending a hand. \"Nice to meet you.\"\n\nThey talked about inconsequential things--favourite movies, hobbies, and the weird smell in the cafeteria. Percy found himself laughing, forgetting for a moment that she was in a strange place. Grover's cheerfulness was contagious.\n\nBut then Nancy Bobofit walked in. She was a redhead with a perpetual sneer, the girl who made everyone else feel small. Percy had seen her type before--the rich bully who ruled the school with an iron fist. She would have been a queen bee if only she had been pretty. Nancy was, quite frankly, hideous.\n\nNancy's eyes landed on Grover, and she wrinkled her nose. \"What's wrong with your legs, freak?\"\n\nPercy's blood boiled. She'd been bullied enough to recognize cruelty when she heard it. How often had she been taunted about not having a father? Every time Father's Day came by, at least one classmate would weaponize the cursed day against her. She had stopped keeping count of how often she had been called stupid and dumb due to her dyslexia. Even the teachers were not above it. But before she could say anything, Nancy turned her attention to her.\n\n\"Hey,\" she purred, batting her eyelashes. \"You're Percy Marina Jackson, right? The model?\"\n\nPercy clenched her fists. She'd done modelling gigs to help pay the bills since she was five years old, but she hated being recognized for them, especially by vicious bullies like Nancy.\n\n\"Yeah, that's me.\"\n\nNancy leaned in, her voice dripping with faux sweetness. \"We should hang out sometime. I know all the cool people.\"\n\nPercy glanced at Grover, who was staring down at his tray, his cheeks flushed. Nancy's hypocrisy was nauseating. \"Thanks, but no,\" Percy said. \"I've got better things to do.\"\n\nNancy's eyes narrowed. \"You'll regret this,\" she hissed. \"I'll make your life hell.\"\n\nPercy shrugged. It wasn't her first rodeo. Hostile schools were her specialty. But she had a feeling Grover needed a friend more than he needed another enemy.\n\nAs days turned into weeks, Percy and Grover became inseparable. They explored the campus together, shared secrets, and laughed until their sides hurt. Then Grover introduced Percy to Mythomagic, a card battle game that brought Greek mythology to life.\n\nThe cards depicted gods, monsters, and heroes. Percy loved it--the thrill of strategy, the rush of power. But there was something deeper. The characters resonated with him--their struggles, their victories. She chalked it up to her mother, who had read him Greek myths as bedtime stories. She'd taken him to museums, pointing out statues of Perseus, the hero who faced impossible odds and emerged victorious.\n\nOne day, as they played Mythomagic, Percy held the card of Perseus--the same hero she was named after. She stared at the image--the winged sandals, the sword, the severed head of Medusa. Her mother's words echoed in his mind: \"Perseus survived, Percy. Against all odds, he stumbled to a happy ending.\"\n\nYet, strangely, it wasn't Perseus's card that gripped Percy's heart. It was the Spartan Prince Hyacinthus--the youth who died tragically, either by a frisbee accident or jealousy-fueled murder. And Icarus--the skydiving fatality, the boy who flew too close to the sun, forever etched in memory.\n\nHer mother had shielded her from their stories, fearing their tragic ends. But Percy wondered why their images haunted her. Why did she feel a strange kinship with these forgotten heroes?\n\nPerhaps it was their defiance--their refusal to be mere footnotes in someone else's tale. Maybe, just maybe, they held secrets that transcended myth and spoke to the hidden corners of Percy's soul. Grover always tried to pull those cards away from her, but she did not allow him. She kept them in her bag, and often, she would stare at them.\n\nShe had to admit, the artwork was gorgeous, much more than the other cards. Both Hyacinthus and Icarus were drawn beautiful enough to put celebrities to shame. They strangely looked alike. Same hair, same face structure. What set them apart were the eyes. Purple eyes are for Hyacinthus, like the flowers named after him, and amber eyes are for Icarus. Reminiscent of the sun that had caused his death. The artwork was different from the other cards, save for two: the cards of the Olympian god Apollo and his son Asclepius. Percy took those two cards to keep in her bag, too. Grover always gave her a glance of fear and pity whenever he saw her looking at the four cards.\n\nAbout a month after they became friends, a new teacher arrived, Mr. Brunner. He was a middle-aged man in a wheelchair who smelled of coffee and had eyes that looked too old for him; he smiled easily and knew the meaning of the word dyslexia. Percy liked him instantly, appreciating how easy his class was and how engaging his teaching.\n\nPercy sat in the back row of Mr. Brunner's mythology class at Yancy Academy. It was her lifelong habit to stay in the back. The less attention on her the better. The teacher would not constantly call on her and then make fun of her when she failed to do what the teacher wanted.\n\nThe room smelled of old books and ancient secrets. Mr. Brunner, the wheelchair-bound teacher, had a way of making the myths come alive, as if they were more than stories.\n\nToday, Mr. Brunner focused on two tales: Hyacinthus and Icarus. Percy listened, half-distracted by the sunlight filtering through the dusty windows. The bronze discus and the ancient amphora depicting Hyacinthus in a swan-drawn chariot feeling from a winged being caught his eye. The swan-drawn chariot, the fleeing figure--it all felt too real. Percy could feel herself sweat with anxiety, ready to spring into a run if needed.\n\n\"Zephyrus,\" Mr. Brunner said, his voice low and haunting. \"The West Wind. He loved Hyacinthus, but fate was cruel. Apollo struck Hyacinthus with a discus during a friendly game. The boy died, and a flower--the hyacinth--bloomed from his blood.\"\n\nPercy's stomach churned. She felt physically ill looking at the discus. Zephyrus--the name filled her with unexplainable hatred. Why did she despise it so? Why did she wish to grab that amphora and break it to pieces until the image of the winged god disappeared?\n\n\"Zephyrus,\" Mr. Brunner continued, \"diverted Apollo's discus so it would strike Hyacinthus dead.\"\n\nPercy clenched her fists. She fought down the urge to scream how unfair it was.\n\nMr. Brunner moved to the next tale. Icarus--the boy who dared to fly too close to the sun. On his desk sat a small bronze statue of a boy with delicate wings. Percy stared at it, feeling a strange connection.\n\n\"But how do you know it's Icarus?\" Percy blurted out. \"There are so many winged gods--Erotes, wind spirits. How can you be certain?\"\n\nMr. Brunner smiled, revealing wisdom etched into his features. \"Look closely, Percy.\" He handed Percy the statue. \"At the base.\"\n\nPercy turned the bronze figure. There, inscribed in ancient Greek, was a name: Ikaros, how the Greeks used to say Icarus.\n\n\"It's not just about wings,\" Mr. Brunner explained. \"It's about hubris, daring to reach too high. Icarus flew too close to the sun, and his waxen wings melted. He fell into the sea.\"\n\nPercy shivered. The statue seemed to hold memories--of a boy who defied the gods and wings that carried dreams and doom. But that did not seem right to her.\n\nDid anyone get the hint at the end of Hyacinthus' section?\n\nHyacinthus, who is almost as against adultery as Hera, gets propositioned by two married men.\n\nIcarus has his first brush with misandry and seeks advice from the sun.\n\nChiron tempts fate.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nPrince Hyacinthus of Sparta stood at the threshold of manhood, his fifteenth birthday marking the moment Spartan males came of age. But this was no ordinary celebration; it was an opulent affair orchestrated by his father, King Amyclas. Hyacinthus was not just any prince--he was the chosen heir, supposed to ascend the throne.\n\nThe festivities unfolded in the grand hall of the palace, adorned with tapestries depicting heroic battles and marble statues of gods. As guests arrived, the air hummed with anticipation, their fine linen robes brushing against the mosaic floors. Argalus and Cynortas, Hyacinthus's older brothers, watched from the shadows, their expressions a mix of envy and resentment.\n\nArgalus, the eldest, nursed a deeper grudge. His wife, Parthenia, had eyes only for Hyacinthus. The young prince's charm and grace had ensnared her heart, leaving Argalus bitter. To make matters worse, Parthenia had not borne him an heir, and whispers of her blatant longing for Hyacinthus echoed through the palace corridors.\n\nCynortas, the middle brother, fared no better. After the scandal involving Parthenia, he remained unmarried. Amyclas struggled to find him a suitable bride, fearing another family scandal. The noble families hesitated, wary of aligning their daughters with a man tainted by association. No one wanted to risk their daughter falling in love with her brother-in-law and disgracing the family.\n\nBut Hyacinthus cared little for such matters. His mind was consumed by the unfinished temple of Hera, rising on the outskirts of Sparta. The goddess demanded perfection, and he supervised the workers day and night, keeping watches as they chiselled marble and invoked blessings. He worried about how strangely the wind behaved around him, making him seek refuge in holy temples. Yet, for this night, he played the dutiful son, feigning delight as the festivities unfolded. He drank wine, sang along, and danced through the feasting hall.\n\nHis two friends, Crocus and Smilax, stood by his side. Having inherited his grandfather's property and fought in multiple conflicts for Sparta, Crocus was in a high position. His wealth and influence now rivalled even the noblest of Spartans. Smilax's father had finally allowed a betrothal between them. They would be wed when Smilax turned eighteen, as it was custom for women of Sparta.\n\nAnd then, she arrived in godly splendour--the muse Clio, Hyacinthus's mother. Her ethereal beauty stirred memories of a time when love flowed freely between her and Amyclas. But that love had shattered, leaving scars on the family. Diomede, their deceased first queen of Amyclas, had suffered the most. Argalus and Cynortas blamed Clio for their mother's heartache and feared her wrath.\n\nAmyclas greeted Clio with a mixture of longing and regret. He knew she had moved on, but old flames die hard. The tension in the room thickened. Argalus and Cynortas exchanged glances, their silence a testament to Clio's immortal power. She was no ordinary woman; she was a goddess, and her wrath could unravel kingdoms. She had little tolerance for any slight towards her beloved son.\n\nAs the night wore on, Hyacinthus danced with Smilax and Crocus, their steps echoing the rhythm of the stars. Clio watched, her eyes filled with both pride and sorrow. She thought she knew her son's destiny--the throne awaited him. But would it bring joy or heartache?\n\nArgalus clenched his fists in the shadows while Cynortas stared into his wine goblet. The lavish celebration masked deeper wounds--the ache of an unhappy and loveless marriage, the burden of expectation, and the fear of divine retribution.\n\nAnd so, Prince Hyacinthus celebrated his fifteenth birthday with his parents, little sister, dearest friends, and grandmother. The temple of Hera stood unfinished, its marble columns reaching for the heavens. Perhaps he would find answers in its sacred halls--the path to kingship, the balm for wounded hearts, and the courage to face an immortal mother's gaze when he felt unworthy of her gifts and favour.\n\nBut for now, the music played, the torches flickered, and the gods observed. In Sparta, where honour and fate intertwined, the lavish celebration masked secrets that would shape the kingdom's destiny. And Clio, her gaze unwavering, sang forgotten verses into the night, weaving the threads of mortal and divine.\n\nHer singing completely outshone the famous mortal bard that Amyclas had invited, a grandson of Apollo named Thamyris. The bard sang gloriously, inspired by the prince's beauty, love blooming in his heart, drawing censure and consternation from the muse and unease and discomfort from her son.\n\nHyacinthus withdrew at the threshold of the grand feasting hall, the air thick with the scent of roasted meats and spiced wine. His fifteenth birthday celebration was in full swing, the flicker of torches dancing across the gilded walls. His father, King Amyclas, presided over the revelry, his laughter echoing through the marble columns.\n\nBut Hyacinthus needed respite. The bard Thamyris had been weaving verses all evening, his honeyed voice extolling the prince's beauty. The courtiers clapped and cheered, oblivious to the discomfort etching lines on Hyacinthus's brow. He was no stranger to flattery, but Thamyris's words felt like a silken noose tightening around his throat. Much like Aristodamia's lascivious eyes on his body, the way she licked her lips when he turned sweaty and flushed from the training grounds. Or like the pleading glances from Parthenia and how she would try to reach him. With both women, Hyacinthus had to flee. He could do nothing but run from them.\n\nHe slipped past the feasting nobles; their goblets raised high, their hands reaching him to pat his shoulders. The night was warm, and the moon was a silver crescent above the palace gardens. Hyacinthus stepped into the fragrant darkness, the petals of roses brushing against his blue himation. Here, away from the prying eyes, he could breathe.\n\nAnd then he heard it--the soft rustle of leaves, the susurrus of wind. Winged Zephyrus, the west wind, stood before him. His eyes were the colour of the dark twilight sky, and his hair, black as pitch, danced in the moonlight.\n\n\"Prince Hyacinthus,\" Zephyrus murmured his voice a breeze that stirred the petals. \"Why do you flee from the bard's praises?\"\n\nHyacinthus's heart raced. \"Lord Zephyrus,\" he whispered. \"Why do you haunt me? In the last few months, you've followed me, the winds only ceasing when inside the temples of the Olympians.\"\n\nThe god's smile was enigmatic as his dark eyes roved across Hyacinthus's body. He drew his himation closer, trying to cover every inch of skin. Not for the first time, he wished that male garments were as modest as women's. He would be delighted to be covered from neck to ankle.\n\n\"You are more than mere mortal, Hyacinthus. Your beauty rivals that of the gods.\"\n\nHyacinthus's pulse quickened, fighting down the urge to run. It was never good when a god praised a mortal's looks. It ended with the mortal harmed or dead. Misfortune befalling.\n\n\"I am a demigod. From what I saw in Chiron's camp, we tend to be pretty. What do you want from me?\"\n\nZephyrus stepped closer, the scent of spring flowers emanating from him.\n\n\"A choice,\" he said. \"Thamyris sings of your loveliness, but I offer something deeper. A love that transcends kingdoms that defies mortal understanding.\"\n\nHyacinthus's mind spun as he felt sick to his stomach. Zephyrus was married. Hyacinthus would never participate in adultery. He would never help someone commit such an act of betrayal.\n\n\"I am a prince,\" he said. \"Bound by duty.\"\n\n\"But are you truly content?\" Zephyrus's fingers reached toward Hyacinthus' face. He flinched back, denying the god a touch of his skin.\n\n\"I was born from an affair between a married king and an immortal goddess. Just by being born, I destroyed a marriage and a family and brought strife to the succession of a throne, of a kingdom. I swore to myself that I would never allow myself to be part of adultery. A conviction has grown stronger while I built the temple of Hera, the goddess of marriage and family.\"\n\nThe god's face twisted in rage.\n\n\"Are you rejecting me? A god?\"\n\nHyacinthus took a breath, trying not to tremble.\n\n\"I am rejecting a married man. I am rejecting destroying your marriage, and I am rejecting the possibility of offending the queen of the gods while I build a temple in her honour.\"\n\nZephyrus opened his mouth to say something but was interrupted by Clio's arrival. Hyacinthus's shoulders dropped in relief when he saw his mother.\n\n\"Mother!\" He exclaimed, running to her like he had done as a small child. He fought the embarrassment that he was now too old to do so.\n\nClio smiled at him and opened her arms to welcome him in her embrace.\n\n\"My sweet child.\"\n\n\"He is no longer a child,\" Zephyrus spoke.\n\nClio barred her teeth at her fellow immortal.\n\n\"He is a child to me, an immortal goddess and will be a child to me even when his hair turns white.\"\n\n\"If he habitually rejects gods, his hair will never turn white.\" Zephyrus snapped back.\n\n\"Is that a threat, Zephyrus?\" Clio stepped in front of her son, her motherly demeanour gone, leaving a daughter of Zeus in its place.\n\n\"What will you do if it is? You are just a muse!\" The god leaned closer, towering over Clio, but the muse did not falter.\n\n\"I am a muse, under the protection of Phoebus Apollon, who does not take insults towards me or my sisters lightly. My father is Zeus. My mother, Memnosyne, is Rhea's beloved sister. I have greater powers than you to call on if I need.\"\n\nAs the god left in a dramatic huff, the wind whipped around mother and son. Clio pursed her lips and turned to her son.\n\n\"If he approaches you again, pray to me immediately.\"\n\nShe waited for him to nod his acceptance of her instruction and gently drew him inside.\n\n\"Your feast still goes on. Come with me, my beloved child. We shall sing a song together.\"\n\n \n\nZephyrus did not show himself again, but the wind kept bothering Hyacinthus. Still, the god did nothing to warrant the prince praying to his mother for help. It was deeply uncomfortable, yet another burden as Hyacinthus dealt with increased duties due to now being of age. He was also worried about Smilax, who had been acting strange after visiting her mother's temple the day after Hyacinthus' birthday. The daughter of Aphrodite had stopped smiling; her brow was always furrowed, and she constantly seemed fearful. But she would not utter a word of what bothered her. Not even Crocus could coax it out of her. Strangely, she told them she would do anything to protect them, confusing both boys.\n\nFive days after Zephyrus declared his intentions toward Hyacinthus, another god visited the prince. This time, it was the north wind, Boreas, older brother of Zephyrus. Much like his brother, he declared his admiration of Hyacinthus' beauty. The prince seriously started to get annoyed. Did all the people just see his looks and nothing else?\n\nBoreas was also a married man. Hyacinthus told the north wind what he had said to the west wind. Much to his relief, Boreas took the rejection more graciously and promised never to pursue him again. The god left distractedly, murmuring about needing to see his wife. Hyacinthus watched him go, deeply relieved.\n\nHis father had tasked him with organizing the Gymnopaedia Festival in honour of Apollo. Hyacinthus will also participate in the ritual dances and songs of the festival. He was not looking forward to it since he would need to dance naked in front of an audience. He loved to dance usually, but since he had come of age, everyone felt free to let their eyes rove lecherously upon him; a few bold ones even tried to touch. He had a feeling that it would get worse after this festival. He complained to Crocus about it. His friend had no useful advice other than suggesting he get betrothed. For that, Hyacinthus also charged Crocus to dance naked on the stage. The son of Poseidon merely laughed and told the prince that he would look forward to it.\n\nThe festival took place on the hottest day of the year. The sun blazed harshly upon the Spartans, making their oiled bodies shine brightly. Thankfully, Hyacinthus was not alone on the stage, but he was right in the centre. In the focus of everyone's attention. He closed his eyes to ignore the audience and lost himself in the music, not noticing how the sunlight focused on him. He sang with the chorus and noticed his voice was sweeter than usual, the song flowing easier from his lips. Had his mother blessed him? She had not mentioned if so.\n\nThe festivities ended well before twilight, and a drizzle of rain started. Hyacinthus donned his armour and left for the woods at a quick pace. There, in the privacy of the woods, he danced in the rain, fully armoured and thankful that the day was over. Unfortunately, he would need to attend next year, but that was a problem for the future Hyacinthus.\n\nUnknown to him, a god he had not met but heard much about was watching. The golden-haired, golden-eyed god watched the beautiful prince, and a desperate, burning longing lit his immoral heart aflame. Apollo fell in love, all on his own and desperately so. He almost appeared before the prince to declare his love and demand Hyacinthus's return of his love, but he restrained himself. He recalled a nymph who fled from him, terrified of his love. He recalled the rumours of how Clio's demigod son had rejected not just one but two gods. The reason he had given was that those two were wed, and he wished not to be part of adultery. How had Hera preened that a young man, a beautiful prince, held the sanctity of marriage in such high regard. Apollo could not be hasty. The prince was his muse's son, and he had to be careful and win him over.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTale of Icarus:\n\nThe moon hung low in the night sky, casting silvery beams upon the secluded glade where Artemis and her immortal huntresses gathered. The air was crisp, and anticipation hummed through the ancient trees. Icarus stood at the center on the cusp of manhood, his heart racing. In his hands was a brand new bow forged from Hephaestus himself at the behest of Artemis. He gently held the softly glowing weapon, delight in his heart. He had already thanked his patron goddess for this gift beyond compare but still had trouble believing he held such a weapon.\n\nArtemis, her silver bow slung across her back, stepped forward. As keen as the arrows she wielded, her eyes bore into Icarus.\n\n\"Icarus,\" she said, her voice echoing through the glade, \"eleven years have passed since you were a tiny child in my arms. Today, you stand on the threshold of adulthood. May your aim be true and your spirit unyielding.\"\n\nThe huntresses, their lithe forms clad in practical chitons of thick and opaque linen, murmured their approval. Polyboea, who had the main charge of Icarus since the age of four, stepped forward. Her eyes held both pride and sorrow. She had told him once that he reminded her of her beloved brother.\n\n\"Icarus, my dear boy, you've grown strong and swift. May the winds guide your arrows, and the forest grant you its secrets.\" Polyboea told him with eyes glowing with pride.\n\nPhylonoe, Britomartis, Hecaerge, Loxo, Oupis, and Eucleia joined, their voices blending like a harmonious chorus.\n\n\"May the stags tremble at your approach,\" Phylonoe smiled.\n\n\"And the wolves yield to your command.\"Britomartis intoned.\n\n\"May the moonlight illuminate your path.\" Was Hecaerge's wish for him.\n\n\"And the stars whisper their secrets to you,\" Loxo spoke.\n\n\"May the nymphs dance in your honour,\" Oupis said.\n\n\"And the rivers sing your name.\" Eucleia was last.\n\nBut amidst the celebration, a shadow fell. Aura, the Titaness of Breezes, stood apart, her disdain evident. She was Artemis' cousin, daughter to Leto's brother Lelantos, and her eyes glimmered with contempt.\n\n\"Artemis, why do you allow this? A male among us--the audacity! You, a virgin goddess, should know better.\" Aura shouted.\n\nArtemis' wrath flared. Her silver eyes blazed.\n\n\"Aura, tread carefully. Icarus is no threat to our vows. His heart is pure, and his loyalty is unwavering. He respects, honours and protects all women from the queen of these lands to the servants in his father's household.\" Artemis snarled at her cousin.\n\nBut Aura's gaze swept over Artemis, lingering on her curves, especially her chest. Icarus recoiled, bile rising in his throat. That was sacrilege. Artemis was the personification of purity and maidenhood; no one should look at her like that.\n\n\"Pure, you say? That lush and buxom body of yours hardly befits a virgin.\" Aura taunted the goddess of virginity, who had sworn eternal maidenhood the moment she was born.\n\nIcarus' jaw dropped in astonishment, unable to believe what he heard. Had Aura gone mad? Had she spied upon a revel of Dionysus and his maenads and taken leave of her senses?\n\nArtemis had advised him always to water down his wine and not to linger too long in Dionysus' new temple because her half-brother had ways of corrupting youth. As the son of a naiad, Icarus knew when water was safe to drink, so he rarely drank wine, only during the king's hideous feasts, when the poor youths and maidens of Athens were taken into the Labyrinth. He needed the wine then and longed to be a lightweight like Ariadne, to knock himself out and not witness the atrocity. Artemis could not interfere, even though she longed to protect those maidens. An Athenian son of Poseidon would be the one to slay the Minotaur the Oracle had spoken. The Fates did not like to be thwarted.\n\n\"Retract your words, Aura, or face my wrath.\" Artemis clenched her fists.\n\nBut Aura remained defiant, pointing to her lean form, almost boyish, with great pride.\n\n\"This is what a true virgin is supposed to look like. Nothing to entice and provoke desire.\"\n\nAura was foolish and knew nothing. Icarus was lean and boyish, too, but he had seen how both men and women looked at him. He was fortunate to be under the protection of Artemis, or they would try more than just look at him.\n\n\"I speak the truth. Your desires are no secret. We all know of Orion. Had your brother not acted, no one would believe in your maidenhood.\"\n\nThe glade crackled with tension. The huntresses shifted, torn between loyalty and fear. Orion was a sore subject for everyone. Polyboea had told Icarus about the giant. Artemis trusted him, but he disappointed and betrayed her. Icarus had vowed to never be like Orion. Unavailable women were unavailable; it was the end of the discussion. He did not know why so many men had trouble understanding that.\n\nPolyboea, ever practical, took Icarus aside. Her skin was pale, and her eyes were wide with fear. Not fear for herself but for him.\n\nPolyboea: \"Leave, my boy. Stay away for a month. Artemis will deal with Aura, and you shouldn't be here. This tension between them has been brewing for a long while and will get ugly.\"\n\nIcarus nodded, his heart heavy. He slipped away, leaving behind the Goddess and Titaness to their strife.\n\nAs Artemis confronted Aura with sharp words of rebuke, the glade echoed with their strong voices that made mortal ears bleed. Deities' tendency to let their divinity slip when angered was yet another reason to send Icarus away. He had Artemis' training and several blessings from her, but he was not an immortal hunter; he lacked their resilience.\n\nIn that moment, Icarus realized that even among immortals, family bonds and discord danced side by side. Aura had never been fond of him, her eyes cold, and never a word to say in his presence, but she had been accepting of him as a child on Artemis' insistence. As he grew, she started sneering at him. Icarus had pretended not to see to keep peace in the group. Aura had said something about Artemis' brother. Only one god was called Artemis' brother, her twin, the sun god Apollo. The divine protector of young men. The same god that Icarus would burn part of his hair for, leaving childhood behind. Maybe that bright-eyed god would have advised Icarus to set tonight's wrongs to the right again.\n\nBy doing this, he would be going against Polyboea's advice. She had told him to avoid the temples of Apollo. Like all god-fearing people, he was to go there during sacred days, but only when there were many people inside, and he always allowed his father to make sacrifices and perform prayers. Icarus had inquired why. Polyboea had been silent for a very long time. She had then told him that he was as beautiful as her tragic brother had been and that only the threat of Artemis' wrath kept unwanted suitors from him.\n\nBut a god would be another matter. Artemis could not protect Icarus from Apollo. Despite his misgivings, Icarus had followed her instructions. Some of the king's guests had made him deeply uncomfortable with their greedy eyes and reaching hands, which he had to evade cleverly. Still, Icarus felt that he had to risk it. Aura was out of control, much like Orion had been.\n\nIcarus visited the family that watched over his father's herds and received one of the finest cows. He led the animal to the temple district in the Port of Knossos, constructed by Daedalus. Every Olympian was represented. The temples of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter and Hestia had gone up first, followed by the younger Olympians. Persephone had a smaller temple close to her mother's grander one. Tyche, Hebe, Eros, Psyche, Dionysus and even Hades had shrines. Today, though, Icarus went straight to Apollo's temple.\n\nThankfully, the priests knew him on sight. Icarus had accompanied Daedalus during the construction many times. As a result, he was ushered ahead of the line by the second-highest priest. Icarus apologetically looked at the people ahead of him but followed the priest. It was never a good idea to argue with priests.\n\n\"Daedalides,\" The priest greeted him pompously.\n\nIcarus fought not to roll his eyes. No matter what he did, how many boars, wolves and bear carcasses he dragged home, he was just the son of Daedalus, the inventor, to pretty much everyone. His father had chuckled at him when Icarus had complained about it once.\n\n\"I have every faith that one day I will be known mainly as the father of Icarus,\" Daedalus had smiled and smoothed Icarus' curls away from his forehead.\n\nIt would take a serious turn of fate for something like that to happen. For little Icarus to overshadow his glorious father.\n\n\"Come now. We will prepare the sacrifice. A very fine offering. Go kneel before the statue and pray to Lord Phoebus.\"\n\nIcarus obeyed, reciting the proper formula before focusing mentally. He recalled the incident between Artemis and Aura as he gazed at Apollo's resplendent, sunlit statue. He stayed there praying for hours when he felt warm sunlight fall on him. He tilted his head up and felt sun rays gently touch his face. Icarus had a strange feeling that the sunlight was utterly shocked and delighted. The image of a beautiful cliff covered in purple flowers overseeing the sunlit sea flashed before his eyes. Icarus rose, knowing where to go. He nodded to the priest and politely said his goodbyes. The priest gave him a small smile.\n\n \n\nApollo stood on the cliff's edge, his gaze drawn to the figure below. The love of his life--reborn, yet unmistakably the same soul that had once been Prince Hyacinthus. The hyacinth flowers swayed around Icarus, their delicate petals like a memory of their past love. A love Icarus did not remember because he would have been compelled to drink from the Lethe before being reborn. No matter, they would love each other again, and this time, Apollo would keep his love. If Zephyrus ever showed his face, he would rip that accursed wind god to shreds. No matter what Zeus said. No matter if it caused a war when Aphrodite and Ares took offence.\n\n\"Icarus!\" Apollo's voice echoed across the cliffs, startling the boy. Icarus teetered, his foot slipping on the rocky edge. Panic flashed in his eyes as he began to fall. Apollo's golden, immortal heart stuttered in his chest. He could not let harm befall his beloved, not again!\n\nApollo moved with divine speed. He caught Icarus, arms wrapping around him, pulling him back from the cliff's edge. Icarus gasped, breathless, and Apollo's heart thundered. How could fate be so cruel and kind at once? His hair, his face, his body, and even his scent were the same. The only thing that differed was the eyes. Purple had been replaced by amber. Eyes much like Apollo's own. The god's mark upon the soul of his lover.\n\n\"Steady,\" Apollo murmured, setting Icarus on stable ground and sitting beside him. \"Forgive me for startling you.\"\n\nIcarus blinked up at him, disoriented. His ankle bled a small wound from the rocks. Apollo's touch healed it instantly, the pain replaced by warmth. Icarus stared, dazed, at the sun god before him.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Icarus asked, voice trembling. Apollo raised an eyebrow. Icarus surely already knew but wanted confirmation.\n\n\"I am Apollo,\" he replied, his smile as bright as the sun. \"And you are Icarus, the boy my beloved twin looked after for eleven years. Without telling me.\"\n\nIcarus frowned. \"I am sure Lady Artemis just forgot to mention me.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" Apollo said softly. \"I know of you now.\"\n\nIcarus touched his ankle and then met Apollo's eyes. \"Why did you come to meet with me?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Apollo confessed, \"I was curious. Most young men pray for their own sake, not that of others.\"\n\nApollo glowed with happiness to have his love alive, breathing and next to him once more. The Fates cackled, but Apollo was too enchanted by his beloved to pay attention to the dreaded three.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nModern times\n\nAfter that fateful lesson caused Percy to experience an upsurge of unexplainable emotions, Mr. Brunner gave her and Grover a Saturday day pass to a private art gallery just a short bus ride from Yancy.\n\n\"A treat. Both of you have been very attentive in my classes. I thought a little time away from the school would do you good.\" He told them with a smile.\n\nPercy thanked him and gratefully took the tickets. A trip away from Yancy, Nancy and her fellow bullies sounded like heaven.\n\nPercy and Grover found themselves in an unexpected place--a remote, private art gallery on the city's outskirts. The sign outside read, \"The Gallery of Celestial Tales.\"\n\nIntrigued, they stepped inside, the doorbell tinkling softly as they entered. Percy tried to google it, but nothing came up. She wondered how Mr. Brunner had found tickets for this place. An odd man guarded the place. He seemed hostile, but he let them in without trouble, except a pointed look at Grover's legs. That caused her friend to flush, and Percy glared at the guard. But the guard ignored her, going back to his paperback novel.\n\nThe gallery was brightly lit, the walls adorned with paintings that seemed to shimmer with otherworldly light. Percy's eyes widened as she took in the first canvas--a vivid depiction of Apollo, the sun god, surrounded by golden rays. But it wasn't just any scene; it was a moment from Apollo's love life.\n\n\"Look,\" Grover whispered, pointing to the title plaque. \"Hyacinthus and Icarus.\"\n\nPercy frowned. She knew about Hyacinthus--the beautiful youth killed by Apollo's discus diverted by the jealous Zephyrus. But Icarus? His legend didn't mention any romantic entanglements with the sun god. She turned to Grover, puzzled.\n\n\"It's in the details,\" he said cryptically. \"Keep looking.\"\n\nAnd so, Percy moved from painting to painting, each revealing a different facet of Apollo's love stories. There was Hyacinthus, his blood staining the earth and Apollo's tears transforming him into a fragrant flower. But then came Icarus--the daring boy who flew too close to the sun on waxen wings. In this version, Apollo's grief was palpable. His love for Icarus transcended mere friendship.\n\n\"Why?\" Percy asked. \"Why Icarus?\"\n\nGrover leaned in, his crutches clicking softly on the polished floor. \"Sometimes, artists take liberties. They weave threads between myths, creating new narratives. Maybe this painter saw something we didn't.\"\n\nPercy studied the next canvas--a series of interconnected scenes. Theseus, the hero, retrieves Icarus's lifeless body from the sea depths. Daedalus, the master craftsman, mourning his son, his face a mask of desperate howling grief. Ariadne, the abandoned lover, her tears falling like pearls. And there, at the center, Apollo--his grief etched into every brushstroke as he snatched Icarus' corpse from Theseus.\n\n\"But look,\" Grover said, pointing to the final painting. \"This is where it gets strange.\"\n\nA strange tree with golden leaves, white blossoms, and sharp thorns stood tall, its smooth bark showing a curious bump similar to a pregnant woman's belly. Apollo's hands were on the trunk, fingers pressing into the wood. And then, the impossible: the tree split open, revealing a golden-haired infant nestled within. Apollo's arms cradled the child, sunlight dancing around them.\n\nPercy's breath caught. \"What is this?\"\n\nGrover hesitated. \"Icarus,\" he said softly. \"The tree--the one that grew from his transformed corpse. But here, it's more. It's rebirth. Apollo's love transcending death.\"\n\nPercy stared at the infant--a tiny, radiant figure. She felt an ache deep within her, a longing she couldn't explain. Tears welled up, blurring her vision.\n\nGrover tugged at her sleeve. \"Percy, we should go. This place--it's too much.\"\n\nBut she couldn't tear her eyes away. The infant in Apollo's arms seemed to call to her, making her long to reach into the painting and pluck him from the god's arms. She wiped her tears, nodded at Grover, and stepped back.\n\nAs they left the gallery, Percy glanced over her shoulder. The doorbell tinkled one last time, and she wondered about the artist--the one who dared to reimagine myths, to paint love in its most extraordinary forms. She thought about that perfect, darling infant.\n\nAs she walked away, she carried that longing with her. For the following months, she would dream of that infant. In her dreams, she would see him grow from a sleeping baby to a giggling toddler, then older and older until he looked about eight years old. To her surprise, he had green eyes just like her.\n\nZephyrus, a married man: I will go and proposition a demigod with a fatal flaw of loyalty who happens to loathe adultery, it will definitely end well.\n\nAura: Body shames an Olympian goddess.\n\nGrover: Why does Chiron think this is a good idea?\n\nWARNING: Gods being gods. Sexual assault(not detailed) consistent with mythology\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nTale of HyacinthusIn the golden light of dawn, Apollo led his sacred cows through the rolling hills near Sparta. The sun god had a secret purpose for grazing his divine herd here--a purpose that had nothing to do with fresh, abundant grass. His heart now beat erratically for a beautiful prince named Hyacinthus. Apollo had been aware of the prince since the demigod was in the womb of Apollo's own Muse, the clever and logical Clio. But he had never had the chance to meet Hyacinthus. The Fates had seemed keen to keep them apart. Clio, of course, constantly sang praises to her beloved son, but Apollo only half listened. All good and loving mothers heaped lavish praise on their children.\n\n \n\nIt caused the god to remain unaware of the fairest of the mortals and the darling of the age. Nonetheless, Apollo had seen the beautiful prince now at a festival in his honour. How beautifully had the boy danced to praise Apollo! And how sweetly he had sung! Apollo could not help himself; he had blessed the boy's voice to be even sweeter and smoother.\n\n \n\nNormally, Apollo would appear before the object of his desire in all his radiant glory. But this time, discretion was paramount. The beautiful prince was no easy conquest, and Apollo had ill luck with anyone who held firm principles and valued themselves. Daphne's sad fate was a very pointed testimony to that.\n\n \n\nEveryone on Olympus knew that Hyacinthus had spurned both Zephyrus and Boreas, the wind gods who had vied for his affections because they were wed, and the prince was adverse to besmirch a marriage. Hera, the guardian of marriage, felt honoured by Hyacinthus's refusal. She had lit upon her son Ares, asking him why he could not show the same restraint when presented with a wedded suitor. The war god, as usual, had ignored his mother's accusations and rebukes on cuckolding his brother. All Ares had to say was that Hera ought to have wed Aphrodite to Ares. The queen had fallen silent.\n\n \n\nArtemis had her thoughts, reminding Apollo that despite the prince's age and desirability, he still fell under her domain. His twin, though, was more impressed by Hyacinthus' respect for women. When the prince needed advice, his first choices were his grandmother, the queen dowager, and his therapoon's betrothed, the daughter of Aphrodite.\n\n \n\nSo, to approach the prince without the risk of being rejected instantly, Apollo disguised himself as a shepherd, his godly splendour veiled by the mist. His sacred cows grazed contentedly on Spartan grass belonging to King Amyclas, unaware of their divine herdsman's ulterior motives. Apollo's heart raced as he approached the field where Hyacinthus and his noble companions practiced gymnastics. Crocus, the son of Poseidon and Hyacinthus' ever-watchful guard, was absent, busy with his betrothed. The youths present were ones that the prince held no fondness for but treated politely for the sake of politics. Apollo could see that Hyacinthus utterly despised at least two well-born youths. The god would investigate that loathing further to see if punishment was needed.\n\n \n\nThe haughty youths scowled at the interruption, eyeing Apollo's humble garb with derision, but in the same breath, they eyed Apollo's beauty with naked want. Some wanted to challenge the stranger and drag him to desolate spots, but Hyacinthus intervened. With a polite but firm nod, he escorted Apollo to a quieter spot. The prince, mistaking Apollo for a common-born shepherd and thus vulnerable to the ill intentions of high-born lustful lordings, offered advice.\n\n \n\n\"Be wary of those entitled brats; avoid coming here during this time,\" he said.\n\n \n\n\"I won't always be here to pull rank and get them to leave you be.\"\n\n \n\nApollo thanked him, secretly thrilled by the prince's concern. Hyacinthus was as kind as he was beautiful. Apollo happily followed the prince away from the haughty youths and into higher grasses and gnarled shrubbery, keeping a close eye on his cows.\n\n \n\nBut then he noticed something--a hidden garden, carefully tended, nestled near the pasture. Apollo's curiosity flared as he eyed the hydrangeas, lavender, and geraniums. \"What's this?\" he asked, gesturing toward the blooms peeking through the foliage. He mentally commanded his cows to stay put and not approach the hidden garden. This was important to the prince.\n\n \n\nHyacinthus's smile made him even more impossibly beautiful. \"My secret,\" he confessed. \"I tend to it when not swimming in the nearby Euphrates river. Not very princely, I suppose. My father would scold me if he knew. \"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus suddenly frowned, noticing some dried and wilting foliage. He left Apollo to his devices and went to tend to his flowers. Wanting to be useful to the prince, Apollo hastened to follow and help. Unfortunately, he was too hasty.\n\n \n\nApollo's embarrassment surged as he realized he'd just uprooted some hydrangea seedlings, mistaking them for weeds. Apollo had to hold up the mist tighter over himself. He was sure his cheeks were blushing bright gold! This was even more mortifying than when he tried to milk a billy goat! Why did this always happen to him?\n\n \n\nBut Hyacinthus only chuckled, gently drawing Apollo away from the surviving seedlings.\n\n \n\n\"An honest mistake,\" he said. \"Don't worry about it. Not all of them would have grown into mature plants anyway.\"\n\n \n\n\"Perhaps I can make amends.\" The god insisted.\n\n \n\nApollo offered to play his lyre and sing a song for Hyacinthus. As the notes danced on the breeze, the prince's eyes widened. He saw through the shepherd's guise--this was no mortal.\n\n \n\n\"You are no mortal,\" The prince breathed. \"No mortal can sing or play like that! You play your lyre as finely as my godly mother and sing even better than her!\"\n\n \n\n\"You are Lord Apollo, aren't you?\" the prince accused, discomfort flashing briefly across his features. He stepped back slightly and looked to the side as if seeking a place to flee.\n\n \n\nGame up, Apollo revealed his true identity, his godly splendour illuminating the field. Hyacinthus' mouth fell open in astonishment before his princely dignity won, and he regained his composure.\n\n \n\n\"Can we still be friends?\" Apollo asked, fearing rejection.\n\n \n\nHe did not want this to happen. Why did he offer to sing? The son of a muse would not be fooled, and he would recognize divine music.\n\n \n\nHyacinthus stared at him for a long while, making Apollo fear that rejection would ensue. But the prince's gaze softened.\n\n \n\n\"You only want to be friends? Nothing else?\" The prince inquired.\n\n \n\nApollo smiled at him. With their crass manners, those brutish wind gods must have frightened the boy. He had heard about how Clio threatened Zephyrus to keep him away from her son.\n\n \n\n\"To be friends. Nothing you don't want.\" He reassured.\n\n \n\nOf course, the god wanted more, but the boy was skittish, and Apollo was confident that his beauty, charm and divine grace would win him over in the end. Meanwhile, Hyacinthus was kind, well-spoken, and had excellent musical taste. Being just his friend for now would be no hardship at all.\n\n \n\nHyacinthus finally relaxed and smiled at Apollo, purple eyes shining mirthfully.\n\n \n\n\"Of course,\" the prince said. \"I have only two real friends, after all.\"\n\n \n\nAfter Hyacinthus was satisfied that his garden was in perfect condition, the two returned to where the prince had left his companions. Apollo felt those youths ought to know who they had treated with derision. He did not tell the prince his intention, but Hyacinthus suspected, given his murmur of boxing the ears of certain someone. Apollo would not do anything drastic and risk leaving a sour impression on his prince, but he would make those haughty youths flee to his altars to beseech forgiveness.\n\n \n\nAfter the terrified and repenting youths had fled from the hills, Hyacinthus introduced Apollo to his pack of seven fine hunting hounds. The hounds had been gifted to the prince by his father, King Amyclas, as puppies shortly before his fifteenth. Hyacinthus had reared the pups, and they had grown into very fine, well-trained hounds.\n\n \n\n\"I had some help from the kennel masters, but father wanted me to train them, so they obey me and heed my commands first.\"\n\n \n\nApollo lavished pats and praise on the hounds, being no stranger to pets himself. These were far sweeter than his sister's hunting hounds. Those curs were too unruly and fond of trying to trip up Apollo every time he visited his sister. He suspected that Artemis had specifically trained them to do so, but she always denied it.\n\n \n\nInspired by these perfectly obedient hounds, Apollo suggested that he and the prince go for a hunt through the forests that dotted the banks of the Euphrates. Hyacinthus agreed with a smile, readying his bow, quiver, spear, javelin and hunting daggers. The mortal prince and god ran through the forests, seeking a game to hunt.\n\n \n\nIn the ancient forests near Sparta, where the Euphrates River flowed lazily, Apollo and Prince Hyacinthus embarked on a shared adventure. Apollo's godly hearing picked up the grunts of a boar.\n\n \n\nThe sun god, mere hours ago disguised as a mortal, revelled in the thrill of the hunt. His divine senses tingled as they tracked a massive boar through the dense underbrush. Apollo's eyes met Hyacinthus's, and a silent understanding passed between them. The beast was near.\n\n \n\nThe boar charged, tusks gleaming like daggers. Apollo's bow sang, and an arrow found its mark. Hyacinthus, swift and agile, lunged with his spear, driving it deep into the beast's flank. Together, they brought down the creature, its death throes echoing through the forest.\n\n \n\nWith reverence, they knelt beside their fallen quarry. Apollo's fingers traced the boar's coarse hide, feeling the pulse of life fade. Hyacinthus, slightly breathless from the fight, watched in awe.\n\n \n\n\"We did it,\" he whispered. \"I have never seen such a large boar before.\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded, his eyes alight with something beyond mortal joy.\n\n \n\n\"Now, let us honour this noble creature.\"\n\n \n\nThey worked in tandem, skinning the boar, their hands slick with blood. Apollo's touch was deft as if he'd done this a thousand times before. Perhaps he had--his twin sister was the goddess of the hunt.\n\n \n\nThey dragged the carcass to a clearing, where Apollo conjured golden, sunny fire with a snap of his fingers. The flames danced, casting shadows on the forest floor. Hyacinthus marvelled at the god's power but was no stranger to the supernatural. After all, he was the son of an immortal goddess, and recently, he rejected the winds themselves.\n\n \n\nAs the boar roasted, Apollo's appetite stirred. His stomach rumbled, and he grinned. \"I have quite the hunger,\" he confessed. \"Being a god has its perks.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus laughed, handing him a carved wooden plate from his satchel. \"You've earned it,\" he said. \"But share some with me, won't you?\"\n\n \n\nApollo sliced off a substantial piece--the choicest part, tender and succulent. He placed it on Hyacinthus's plate, their fingers brushing. \"For you,\" he murmured.\n\n \n\nThe prince's heart raced. Apollo's eyes held secrets. But he dared not speak them aloud. Instead, he savoured the boar, its flavor mingling with the forest's scent.\n\n \n\nAnd then Apollo devoured the rest. The entire boar disappeared into the god's voracious hunger. Hyacinthus watched, torn between awe and amusement.\n\n \n\n\"You truly are insatiable,\" he teased.\n\n \n\nApollo wiped his mouth, his lips stained with grease, his golden eyes gleaming with a mysterious emotion.\n\n \n\n\"Forgive me,\" he said. \"But I am a god, and my appetites know no bounds.\"\n\n \n\nAs the fire crackled, they sat side by side, bellies full. Apollo's gaze lingered on Hyacinthus, and momentarily, the world held its breath.\n\n \n\n\"We make a good team,\" he said softly.Hyacinthus nodded. \"Indeed,\" he replied. \"And perhaps we've found something more in this shared victory.\"\n\n \n\nBut he had no idea what they found. The god did, and given that knowing smile, he shot the prince.\n\n \n\nApollo suggested they cool off in the nearby Euphrates when their hunger was sated. The river flowed like liquid silver, its banks adorned with reeds and wildflowers. They stripped off their blood-streaked garments and waded in, the water embracing them like an old friend.\n\n \n\nApollo splashed Hyacinthus, and the prince retaliated, laughter echoing across the water. They swam, their limbs entwined, until the sun dipped low, casting golden ripples upon the surface. Apollo's laughter was like sunlight breaking through leaves, and Hyacinthus felt more alive than ever. Apollo's company was as easy as that of Crocus and Smilax, but they had never caused his heart to beat faster or his stomach to feel like butterflies had nested there. Hyacinthus had no name to give to this feeling.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nTale of IcarusPolyboea watched as Artemis and Aura clashed, throwing sharp insults and sharper taunts at each other. As she had told Icarus, her beloved brother reborn, this ugly tension had been long brewing. The former princess of Sparta suspected that it had begun even before Artemis had been born. Aura was older than the elder Olympians. She was Leto's niece and daughter to Lelantos. The titan lord of the hunt, the wild and the winds. Domains that had been usurped from him when Kronos fell. Aura had been a princess almost. But with one stroke of fate, because her father supported the wrong side, she went from the daughter and granddaughter of high powers to a minor titaness. Remarkable only because she was related to Leto, and her glorious children. That ought to rankle.\n\n \n\nPolyboea knew. After Hyacinthus had died, Argalus had become the heir. Parthenia was the mistress of the palace. Grandmother Sparta had perished shortly after Hyacinthus. Her father had lasted longer, but he was a shell of his former self after his most beloved child had died. Polyboea went from the beloved and favoured sister of the heir and future king to a nuisance that their family could not be rid of fast enough.\n\n \n\nUnlike Aura, she had options. Hyacinthus, her clever brother, had primed her to become a huntress since she was a toddler, and thanks to his training, Artemis gladly accepted her in her ranks. Argalus and Parthenia were dust, and Polyboea had not aged a day. After a short reign, Argalus died without an heir, Cynortas took the throne after him, and Oebalus after Cynortas. At least Cynortas lasted enough to see Oebalus to manhood.\n\n \n\nThe first Hyacinthia festival of Sparta was held mere days after her beloved brother had died at Apollo's wrathful insistence. His rage had ensured that Argalus and Cynortas held it every year out of fear. Oebalus held it out of deep respect for the uncle he never met.\n\n \n\nPolyboea smiled fondly as she recalled her nephew. Oebalus held himself to Hyacinthus' teachings and writings, making him an excellent king. Under his reign, the Hyacinthia festival became a marvel. He even named his fourth son Hyacinthus. Not the wisest decision, much like his granduncle, that boy died tragically young, but his older brothers lived, and Tyndareus ruled Sparta now. He had wed a Boeotian princess, and she had already birthed him a daughter. More children would hopefully follow.\n\n \n\nWhile Polyboea had to leave her princess title and the luxuries of the palace she was born in, and even abandon her blood, Polyboea was richly rewarded for her sacrifices. Her brother had risen from the dead and returned to her as sweet Icarus. Now, she could do for him what he had done for her. Take him under her wing, protect him, teach him, prepare him for the harshness of life in a gentle way that did not break his spirit. More importantly, she could give him the love and affection her brother always showed her.\n\n \n\nHer brother even had the same face, save for his eyes. Instead of the purple eyes Hyacinthus had inherited from his godly mother, the fair Clio, Icarus, had eyes like amber. Apollo had truly left his mark upon him.\n\n \n\nIcarus had grown into a young man of which even Artemis was proud. For Aura to be so harsh and hateful toward him was unforgivable. What the titaness had said about Artemis was sacrilege of the highest order. It was not the goddess's fault that Aura had lost everything. The fault lay with Ouranos, the sky primordial, that vicious, cruel being who started the horrible chain of harm that spurred both gods and mortals to cruelty and viciousness generation after generation, each cycle worsening. Generational trauma, Hyacinthus had called it. Polyboea sometimes spent long hours pondering the generational trauma of her bloodline. One was caused by Aphrodite, who pushed Clio into the arms of Amyclas.\n\n \n\nGetting nowhere with Aura, Artemis left the forest glades of Crete for Olympus. Her cousin needed to be taught a very sharp lesson, one very long overdue. Artemis' beloved mother would object, but she could not indulge this time. The goddess of the hunt had tolerated far too many slights from Aura for the sake of Leto. No more. Her cousin did not appreciate Leto's kindness. She had spat on Leto's compassion and Artemis' forbearance for the last time.\n\n \n\nIn the bright, luxurious halls of Olympus, Artemis sought Dionysus--the god of wine and debauchery. Normally, she would avoid this strange half-brother of hers with the same vehemence she avoided the lustful, conniving Aphrodite. He was so contrary to her domains. She was pure; he was debauched. She led hardworking maidens into gruelling hunts; he led dissipated meanads into lascivious revels. She protected innocence; he despoiled it.\n\n \n\nBut Dionysus had a use. His passion for Aura was legendary, an obsession that nearly consumed him. Artemis drew him aside and whispered her plan to her half-brother: drug Aura, neutralize her, and strip her of her virginity. It was a punishment that would echo through eternity.\n\n \n\nIt brought Artemis pain to do this, but Aura would never learn otherwise, and others might start to disrespect Artemis and question her chastity. Her very domain that made up her being. If Artemis' name were diminished, the women under her protection would no longer be safe. Brutish men craved what they could not have. If Artemis were dishonoured, they would fall upon her cherished maidens like a pack of starving wolves. Her fierce Huntresses and devoted priestesses shouldn't suffer due to Aura's pride.\n\n \n\nDionysus's eyes gleamed. He revelled in chaos, and this was a symphony of vengeance. Aura had rejected him numerous times, and no god liked hearing the word no.\n\n \n\n\"I accept,\" he murmured, his voice like a heady wine. \"Aura will know my touch and her purity will crumble.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis recoiled in disgust, bile rising to her throat. She curled her hands into fists and fought down the urge to strike the despoiler. With great effort, she nodded and left Olympus to return to her loyal huntresses.\n\n \n\nAnd so, on a moonless night, Dionysus disguised himself as a maiden and lured Aura with wine. She drank, her senses dulled, and he led her to a secluded glade. There, under the watchful and disgusted eyes of Artemis, he took her innocence. The forest whispered secrets, and Aura's defiance melted into wine-fueled surrender.\n\n \n\nArtemis watched, her heart torn between wrath and regret, her ichor boiling at going against her domain to preserve it. She had become what she despised--a manipulator of fate like Aphrodite. But Aura's punishment was sealed. It had to happen, and the huntress would bear the consequences.\n\n \n\nAs dawn painted the sky, Aura lay spent and changed. Dionysus's seed had taken root, and the Titaness carried life within her. The goddess of childbirth and divine patron of pregnant women could sense it. Divine twins, much like Artemis and Apollo, had been a taunt from the Fates.\n\n \n\nArtemis's revenge was complete, yet her heart ached. She had sacrificed her principles to punish Aura, and the groves wept in silent witness because the goddess could not allow herself to tears. Artemis wondered if she had punished Aura or herself for allowing her disrespect to go this far. Maybe, just maybe, if she had taken her cousin to task sooner, Artemis would not have to resort to such dirty and low means of reestablishing her authority and dignity. To keep the maidens sworn to her safe.\n\n \n\nWhen Artemis returned to the huntresses, she found Polyboea waiting. Her eyes held questions, but she silenced them. The former princess remained untouched, her innocence intact in flesh, soul and mind. Apollo's wrath had spared her from a sad fate, and now Artemis's vengeance had spared her from losing her brother once more. Looking at Polyboea and her other huntresses brought Artemis peace. Her actions would protect them.\n\n \n\nAs for Aura, her fate was sealed. She would bear two children--a reminder of divine wrath and the consequences of pride. No one was untouchable to the divine justice of the Olympians. And Artemis, forever the moon's guardian, wondered if vengeance truly healed or perpetuated the cycle of pain. Perhaps the future would tell her.\n\n \n\nWhile Artemis plotted vengeance and watched Aura, Apollo could spend time with Icarus unhindered by his fierce sister. Crete was not Sparta, but the god and his reborn beloved still found forests to hunt together in, rivers to swim in, and fields to run in. Icarus' archery was perfect, a testament to his training from Artemis, which made Apollo sad because he had one less subject to teach. But he could help Icarus improve his lyre.\n\n \n\nIn his first life, Apollo's lover had been taught music and instruments by his mother, a glorious muse, but in this life, Icarus only had his father's tutelage. Daedalus was many things, but master musician was not one of them. Apollo took delight in guiding the boy's fingers through the strings, showing him when to pluck to produce the sweetest sound.\n\n \n\nIcarus spoke to him of his life. He spoke of his beloved father, who often was so busy that they could only see each other at meals. He spoke of his closest friend, as dear to him as a sister, the Princess Ariadne. Icarus had convinced Daedalus to break customs and educate Ariadne. An endeavour richly rewarded. Skilled in mathematics, the princess had helped Daedalus utilize every coin of the treasury allotment to build new temples and monuments to the point where Daedalus even had enough funds to spare for a large shrine to Hades.\n\n \n\n\"Why a shrine to my uncle down below?\" Apollo had asked Icarus, and the boy had blushed.\n\n \n\n\"Well, when the temples to your father, his sisters and second brother were going up, I was around ten. I thought it was unfair that only the Receiver was denied a temple among the children of the Great Mother. My father could not get enough gold for a temple, but he could get enough for a shrine.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus sighed.\n\n \n\n\"After the Harvest feasts, I go there to pray for those unfortunate youths and maidens sacrificed to the monster. It does help. Or when I miss my mother.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Modern times\n\n \n\nPercy followed the rest of her Yancy class into the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Grove walked by her side on his crutches. Percy gritted her teeth, feeling yet another surge on unexplainable rage. She eyed the gloomy sky with scorn. Why couldn't they have a sliver of sunlight? It would improve her foul mood for sure. Grover kept shooting her looks of concern and pointed to the remarkable architecture of the building, trying to get her interested in the arches and the crenellations. Percy couldn't bring herself to pay to the MET building.\n\n \n\nSince December 21, Winter Solstice, she had been feeling unexplainable and severe mood swings. She could go from being calm to utterly furious in the span of seconds without any sort of external stimuli to explain it. When she was not feeling apocalyptic rage, she felt offended, humiliated and strangely hurt with nothing happening in her life to explain it. If she did not know any better, she would say that she was feeling someone else's emotions, but that was a ridiculous thought. Grover had picked up on it because he kept trying to distract and cheer her up. Percy hoped that this was not a side effect of puberty because she did not want to deal with this for years.\n\n \n\nShe followed the rest of the students into the halls containing Greek and Roman art. She eyed the white marble statues, strangely disappointed by their lack of colour. Mr Brunner was explaining about steles, ancient Greek funeral art. The displayed steles were of a young girl, perhaps Percy's age or older. Mr Brunner's eyes were sad, as if he had personally attended that girl's funeral. The other one was of a young man and a toddler, which in Percy's opinion was even sadder but Mr. Brunner just glossed that over.\n\n \n\nNancy and her friends were making nuisances of themselves, making it hard to listen to the teacher and focus on the art. Irritatingly, Percy told them to shut up, which came out a bit loud. Mr. Brunner heard her and called Percy's forward, asking her to identify the subjects of a carved relief. Percy looked at it briefly and grimaced.\n\n \n\n\"Is is the Titan King Kronos devouring his children, the elder Olympian gods.\"\n\n \n\nTo her relief, Mr. Brunner went on to explain about Kronos, Rhea, their first five children. And about their sixth child, Zeus. Mr. Brunner did praise Percy for recognizing the subjects. Percy smiled at him in appreciation, which made Nancy's hackles rise up.\n\n \n\n\"What does it matter?\" Nancy snarled.\n\n \n\n\"How will it be useful in real life to know that Kronos ate his kids?\"\n\n \n\nInstead of disciplining the brat, Mr Brunner turned to Percy and asked her to explain why it mattered. Percy bit down a new swell of rage, mostly hers and answered.\n\n \n\n\"It is the concept of generational trauma. It started with Kronos' father, the primordial of the sky, Ouranos. He was an abusive father, and that taught Kronos to be an abusive father. The cycle of harm and pain continued to the next generation and then the next. It matters in real life because people need to recognize when families suck.\"\n\n \n\nMr. Brunner's eyebrows rose, and Percy continued.\n\n \n\n\"For example, Nancy, the nasty bully, is a prime example of someone raised in a toxic environment. Her parents and grandparents must be awful, so she is awful.\"\n\n \n\nMr. Brunner sternly shot Percy as Nancy sputtered in shock and anger.\n\n \n\n\"No need to call out your classmate, Miss Jackson.\"\n\n \n\nPercy gave him a smile that was all teeth.\n\n \n\n\"She was the one that wanted to know why learning about Kronos matters, Mr Brunner.\"\n\n \n\nGrover drew Percy aside to look at some paintings. Percy recognized the subject immediately.\n\n \n\n\"The god Apollo.\" She told Grover.\n\n \n\nHer friend smiled.\n\n \n\n\"Wow! That was fast! You are good at this.\"\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head.\n\n \n\n\"I only recognized him from the lyre that he is holding. Very distinctive.\"\n\n \n\nThat seemed to impress Grover even more.\n\n \n\n\"It's great how easily you can recognize godly symbols of power.\"\n\n \n\nPercy frowned. That was an odd way to put that.\n\n \n\n\"Honestly, the only ones I can reliably remember are Apollo's lyre and Poseidon's trident.\"\n\n \n\nThe new Algebra teacher, Mrs. Dodds, sharply turned around from where she was talking to Nancy and looked straight at Percy. Nancy smirked as Mrs. Dodds began to practically run to Percy. Grover let out a bleat of distress. The girl turned around to eye him. Why was he imitating a goat?\n\n \n\n\"Miss Jackson, come with me!\"\n\n \n\nPercy frowned and shot a glare at Nancy, the foul little pest. What lies had she told Mrs Dodds this time?\n\n \n\nSince starting to work at Yancy, Mrs. Dodds had it out for Percy, constantly tormenting her and listening to Nancy's tall tales like gospel.\n\n \n\n\"We are not supposed to separate from the main group!\" Grover spoke up again, desperately looking at Mr. Brunner, who was not even looking in their direction. Mrs. Dodds glared at Grover, and Percy decided to go with the woman to avoid any trouble.\n\n \n\nMrs. Dodds guided her to a room housing ancient weapons. Percy shivered when she saw a bronze discus, her mood plummeting.\n\n \n\n\"What nonsense was Nancy spouting this time?\" Percy asked, feeling tired of school, classmates and unfair teachers.\n\n \n\nMrs. Dodds did not answer. She just looked at the disc.\n\n \n\n\"Did you think you would get away with it, Perseus Jackson?\" The math teacher snarled, much to Percy's confusion.\n\n \n\n\"Get away with what?\"\n\n \n\n\"With what you did to your uncle!\" Mrs Dodds hissed, her tongue seeming to elongate and split in three. Percy stepped back in confusion.\n\n \n\n\"I don't have an uncle, Mrs. Dodds. My mother is an only child, and my father has been lost at sea since my mother was pregnant with me. If he had any family, I was never told about it.\"\n\n \n\n\"Stop lying!\" Screeched the woman, wings unfurling from her back and claws from her fingers.\n\n \n\n\"I know what you are! Whose you are! Your uncle knew about you the day you were born! He was merciful and spared you! Even blessed you so none of us would torment you like you deserve! And you repaid him, his kindness, with treachery!\"\n\n \n\nThe monstrous woman launched herself at Percy, who dodged automatically. The bronze hairpin in her hair vibrated, and Percy automatically removed it.\n\n \n\nTo her astonishment, the hairpin elongated in her hand until Percy found herself holding a bronze sword. A xiphos, something in her mind, whispered. The weapon felt utterly natural in her hand.\n\n \n\nMrs. Dodds attacked, and Percy was ready. She swung her sword at the woman's neck. The sword cut her like butter, drawing a shriek as the demon math teacher disappeared into a cloud of golden dust.\n\n \n\nPercy paused her sword in her hand, images flashing in her mind. She could recall herself wearing armour, leading troops of warriors to battle against monsters and other human warriors. But she was not supposed to be alone. Something, someone was missing.\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head, spooked, to clear her mind of the sudden fancy. The sword shrank back down until it as a bronze hairpin again. Percy stared at it, mystified and wondered what had been in her breakfast. She put the hairpin in her hair again and walked out of the weapon display room to find Grover and Mr. Brunner.\n\nBoth her friend and her teacher denied that Mrs. Dodds had ever existed.\n\nThey told Percy that the only math teacher had been Ms. Kerr, a gray eyed blonde. Percy looked at the teacher and felt a sudden urge to throttle her. The gray eyes elicited both regret and fury. Not for the first time since Winter Solstice, Percy wondered if she was going mad.\n\nAura's fate is consistent with mythology. I do not condone SA on anyone for any reason.\n\nHyacinthus gets a quest.\n\nArtemis regrets what she did.\n\nPercy visits Montauk\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nHyacinthus inspected the soldiers' training with Crocus by his side. The sun shone cheerfully bright. The prince smiled at the sun, feeling increased heat on his cheeks. The sun wobbled a bit as if waving at Hyacinthus. To the prince's left, his best friend grimaced, both from the antics of the sun god and his own personal worries.\n\n \n\n\"I don't know what is going on with Smilax. She keeps jumping at every shadow.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus finally tore his eye away from the sun to look at the son of Poseidon. The sun dimmed ever so slightly in response.\n\n \n\n\"That is not like her. She still will not tell you what is going on?\"\n\nBoth friends were worried about the sole female of their tightly-knit demigod trio.\n\nCrocus shook his head in denial.\n\n\"This started after she visited her mother's temple. The priestesses gossiped that the goddess of love appeared to talk to Smilax, but none of them had overheard what it was.\"\n\nHyacinthus' heart sank. Aphrodite was capricious and often cruel. Thankfully, Smilax had not inherited those aspects of her mother. If Aphrodite had made a request that Smilax could or would not grant, it would get ugly. Hyacinthus took a deep, shuddering breath.\n\n\"Smilax's mother must have wanted something.\" He told the obvious to Crocus.\n\nHis friend rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Of course, why would a god bother with a mortal otherwise? Only when they want something.\"\n\nCrocus gave a very pointed look at Hyacinthus and then at the sun. The prince grimaced but did not answer, it did not seem right to have this conversation with his friend while the sun god was right over their heads.\n\nWhen he met the sun god, the youths in that fateful field with Hyacinthus immediately told everyone what had happened. The whole of Sparta was speculating about the crown prince and the god of the sun. The rumours were ridiculously steamy. Even Hyacinthus' father, King Amyclas, did not believe that all his son did with Apollo was hunt and then swim. It did not help that Apollo had repeatedly shown up to take the prince to other outings in the woods to play the lyre together in the palace gardens.\n\nNo matter how much Hyacinthus insisted they were just friends, no one believed him. Not the newly appointed royal bard, Thamyris, who had been constantly singing about heartbreak. Something about his grandfather stealing the love of his life. Was Hyacinthus supposed to be the love of Thamyris life? They had barely exchanged two words. The only one unaware of the rumours was the long-standing royal physician, a son of Apollo named Solon, who cloistered himself in the palace's apothecary and infirmary and made it a point to avoid gossip.\n\nSolon was of an age with Queen Sparta and had been appointed to his position by King Lacedaemon, having attended Chiron's camp together. He had seen Amyclas and his sister Euridice born and tended to each royal ever since. As a demigod, Hyacinthus never suffered sickness; injuries were usually healed by the nectar and ambrosia his mother regularly gifted him. The prince had rarely needed to interact with the royal physician. Hyacinthus never god sick, and Solon had been fond of Diomede. Not enough to need getting rid of, but fond enough that the prince considered interacting with him an unpleasant chore.\n\nNow, Hyacinthus would need to visit Solon. Ever since meeting Apollo, the prince had been feeling strange. Whenever he was near the god or just thinking about him, his heart would beat faster, and he would feel butterflies flying around his stomach. Hyacinthus would also blush, heat rushing to his cheeks, making them rosy as if he had a fever. Hyacinthus had never had a fever his entire life thanks to being a demigod. He would lay awake, thinking of Apollo's smile, the way his skin glowed, how the breeze ruffled his golden hair. Hyacinthus would feel strange, needing to rise and perform some gymnastics to calm down again.\n\nNormally Hyacinthus would go to one of his friends with his troubles. Like all girls that had attended Chiron's camp, Smilax was well versed in basic medicine. But the daughter of Aphrodite had been tense, worried and afraid since her godly mother had visited. Hyacinthus could not add yet another burden upon her. Crocus would be his second choice but his right hand man was worried sick about his betrothed. It did not affect his official duties, Crocus was Spartan, he knew better than to let personal issues affect what he owed to kingdom and state. Still, Hyacinthus did not find it fair to worry Crocus even more. The crown prince of Sparta would need to go and visit the royal physician for the first time. Hopefully Diomede would not come up.\n\nHyacinthus idly considered asking Apollo the next time he saw the god, but discarded the idea. In addition to god of healing, Apollo was also the god of plague. If Hyacinthus told him about strange symptoms in his presence, it would sound like he was accusing the god of making him sick. That was not done. Hyacinthus did not believe that Apollo would do that either. The god had been so kind, gentle and tender towards the prince. Just thinking about it, made Hyacinthus' heart race once again.\n\nA visit to Solon could not happen soon enough. Still, Hyacinthus needed to be discreet. If anyone saw him visiting the physician it would be noted. Polyboea, Amyclas and Sparta would worry and make quite the fuss. He was the crown prince, always watched by everyone, not just his family.\n\n \n\nLater in the day, when the sun hung low over the Spartan hills, Hyacinthus found himself standing outside the door of the royal physician, Solon. Solon, despite his age, bore the clear signs of being a demigod--his face not as furrowed as others his age, features still too perfect to be a full mortal. Appointed by King Lacedaemon, Solon was renowned for his wisdom and healing arts. His eyes held secrets, and his touch could coax life from the brink of death.\nSolon's surprise was palpable when Hyacinthus entered his modest office. The prince, usually distant from the physician, stood before him with an uncharacteristic vulnerability and anxiety. Worried, Solon motioned for him to sit, curiosity etching lines on his weathered face.\n\n\"Prince Hyacinthus,\" Solon began, \"what brings you here? Surely, you do not seek my services.\"\n\nHyacinthus shifted uncomfortably.\n\n\"No, it's not an injury or ailment. It's... something else.\"\n\nHe hesitated, then blurted out.\n\n\"When I'm near this friend of mine, my heart races, my stomach flutters, and I--I blush.\"\n\nSolon's laughter erupted--a rich, melodious sound that echoed off the stone walls. Hyacinthus's cheeks flushed, and he felt a surge of indignation. How dare the physician mock him? He had been worried for weeks!\n\n\"Forgive me,\" Solon said, wiping tears from his eyes.\n\n\"But those are not symptoms of any physical ailment, my prince.\"\n\n\"Then what are they?\" Hyacinthus snapped.\n\nSolon leaned forward, a smile on his lips, and his eyes dancing with glee.\n\n\"Love, my dear prince. You are in love.\"\n\nHyacinthus recoiled. Love? He, who had never been afflicted by such? Hyacinthus had stood surrounded by daughters of Aphrodite doing their best to tease him, and had been immune to their allure. Many had tried to bewitch him without success. Daughters and sons of Spartan nobles, visiting dignitaries, many nymphs, passing bards. Hyacinthus had never flickered or looked twice. It was absurd. Yet, the truth settled like dew on a morning leaf. He loved Apollo--the one who appeared almost every day to whisk him to the wooded mountains, laughed and sang sweetly, and vanished like a wisp of smoke.\n\n\"Why would love afflict me?\" Hyacinthus demanded.\n\n\"I am the son of the most logical muse.\"\n\nSolon's laughter returned, louder this time. The old physician had to sit himself down due to his uncontainable mirth at the prince's expense. Hyacinthus' irritation with the old man grew further.\n\n\"Ah, Prince Hyacinthus, love cares not for divinity or mortality. It strikes where it wills, weaving its threads through hearts and souls. The lady of love and her winged son are so feared for good reasons. Their power is such that even the gods themselves fear them.\"\n\nSolon managed to speak out before once more bursting into laughter. The old physician found far too much amusement in the prince's predicament.\nAnnoyed and desperate to silence the laughter, Hyacinthus blurted out the truth.\n\n\"The friend I speak of is your divine father, Apollo.\"\n\nSolon's mirth vanished. His eyes widened, and he clasped his hands together.\n\n\"Apollo? The sun god?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Hyacinthus said.\n\n\"He visits me in almost every day, and my heart dances to his silent tune.\"\n\nSolon's expression shifted from amusement to concern. He looked at the prince as if measuring him for his funeral linens. Hyacinthus felt himself shiver, a cold shadow passed over him, icy fingers briefly caressing his nape.\n\n\"Apollo is capricious, my prince. His love is both a blessing and a curse. Beware.\"\n\nAnd so, the prince and the physician sat in that dim room, bound by secrets and the fragile threads of love. Apollo's presence loomed over them, casting shadows on their intertwined fates. Solon, once laughing, now wore a mask of worry. He remembered his mother, constantly looking for a god that would never return to her--wasting her youth, beauty, and health, yearning for what she would never have. The physician did not want the extraordinary prince to end up like her. Neither did he want to see Hyacinthus perish and become a bit of greenery.\n\nFor Prince Hyacinthus, his heart had awakened--a heart that beat not with royal dignity, but with the ache of longing. And in the quiet moments, when the sun dipped below the horizon, he wondered if love was the truest gift the gods bestowed upon mortals. Or if it was the greatest curse. Hyacinthus had seen what loving Clio had done to Amyclas. What would loving Apollo do to Hyacinthus?\n\nConfused and more than a little upset Hyacinthus ran towards the field where he first met Apollo. He walked in his secret garden contemplating the sunset. His footsteps traced memories--the day he first met Apollo, the sun god, who appeared like a radiant vision amidst the flowers. Hyacinthus bent down by his beloved blue and purple hydrangeas and caressed the petals gently. Such a beautiful flower, if only it had scent. He could almost see other blue and purple flowers with furled, delicate petals, emitting an intoxicating scent. The curl of that unknown flower almost echoing the curl of his own hair. Hyacinthus could almost see Apollo holding that non existent flower.\n\nBut now, standing in the same field where their paths had crossed, Hyacinthus's heart trembled. The royal physician's words echoed in his mind: Love. The word tasted strange on his tongue, like honey mixed with salt. He had sought Solon's counsel, hoping for a cure, only to discover that his ailment was not physical but ethereal--a malady of the soul. Something he had long hoped to be immune to. Love in his experience only brought trouble and heartache.\nAnd there, amidst the swaying grass, Apollo materialized, grace and beauty incarnate. Hyacinthus stared at the perfect golden god--his perfect golden god. Apollo's blonde curls shone, forming a halo around his exquisite face, golden eyes staring down at Hyacinthus. The prince's gaze travelled down, noticing that the firm, chiselled muscles were barely hidden by a translucent chiton for the first time. The god's tanned skin glowed as if lit from within.\n\nHyacinthus' heart stuttered. His breath caught in his throat and he could feel his face burn. Something strange stirred in his belly. A heat that pooled around his groin and then spread to his veins. Hyacinthus felt too warm and longed to throw himself into cold waters to make the burn stop.\n\nApollo's presence was both blinding and gentle, like sunlight filtered through leaves. His eyes held the secrets of eternity, and his smile--the curve of dawn--stirred something within Hyacinthus. The prince felt the sudden urge to kiss that smile. Normally the idea of kissing someone filled him with revulsion. Why was it so different. How did love so utterly change someone?\n\n\"Prince Hyacinthus,\" Apollo said, his voice a melody woven into the wind.\n\n\"Why do you look so troubled?\"\n\nHyacinthus's tongue betrayed him. He stuttered, his words tripping over each other.\n\n \n\n\"I--I am not troubled, Lord Apollo. It's just... I--\"\n\nApollo's brow furrowed at the too-formal address and sensed the lie. Truth was his domain after all. Apollo knew when what he heard was not true, just like his thieving brother knew when he heard lies.\n\n\"Speak, my prince. You can hide nothing from me.\"\n\nAnd so, Hyacinthus confessed. He spoke of Solon's laughter, the blush that stained his cheeks, and the fluttering in his chest whenever Apollo drew near. He revealed the diagnosis--the absurdity of love afflicting a someone that wanted nothing to do with it.\nApollo listened, his expression shifting from curiosity to concern and then to happiness.\n\n\"Love,\" he murmured. \"A mortal affliction, yet it binds even the gods.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Hyacinthus asked. \"Why would love to choose me? I never sought it.\"\n\nApollo stepped closer, his fingers brushing Hyacinthus's cheek. His thumb gently stroking the lovely cheekbone.\n\n\"Perhaps love is not a choice, my prince. It is a force that defies reason, weaving its threads through hearts and destinies.\"\n\n\"But you. Aren't you upset?\"\n\nHyacinthus said, his voice raw.\n\n\"When we first met, I asked about your intentions. I did not want romantic entanglements.\"\n\nApollo's eyes softened. \"And now?\"\n\nHyacinthus's gaze dropped, feeling shame at being so inconsistent.\n\n\"Now, I have gone against myself. I am in love with you.\"\n\nApollo's laughter rang out--a celestial sound that danced across the meadow.\n\n\"Oh, Hyacinthus,\" he said, \"you have no idea how long I've waited to hear those words.\"\n\nThe prince's heart raced. \"You... you love me back?\"\n\nApollo's smile was radiant.\n\n\"More than you can imagine. I am overjoyed, my dear sweet prince.\"\n\nHyacinthus's knees threatened to buckle.\n\n\"But I am mortal. You are a god.\"\n\nApollo cupped his face. His molten golden eyes meet Hyacinthus' purple ones.\n\n\"Immortality does not diminish love. It amplifies it. And as for entanglements, I assure you, I do not mind. Quite the opposite, my love.\"\n\nAnd so, in the slowly darkening field where the sun god parked his chariot, Prince Hyacinthus and Apollo stood--an immortal and a demigod, their hearts entwined. The wind carried their whispered promises, and the flowers leaned closer as if witnessing a celestial union.\n\nHyacinthus felt vulnerable, exposed, and raw in front of the god. He blushed, looked away, and wondered if love was the truest gift the gods bestowed upon mortals. Apollo, the sun god, held him close, and the world seemed to hold its breath.\n\nFor in that moment, love transcended realms--the divine and the mortal--binding them together like constellations in the night sky. And as the sun dipped below the horizon, Hyacinthus knew that he had found something more precious than immortality: love.\n\n \n\nThe moon hung low in the sky, casting a silver hue upon the banks of the Euphrates river. Prince Hyacinthus stood there, his heart racing, as if the very heavens conspired to weave a tale of love and desire.\n\nApollo, radiant and ethereal, had descended from the heavens to join him. The god's eyes, like molten gold, held a hunger that thrilled and slightly frightened Hyacinthus. He was not afraid of Apollo, he was afraid of the strange, unfamiliar feelings that the god evoked in him. They had swum together, their laughter echoing across the water, splashing each other playfully. But now, as the sun dipped toward the horizon, something shifted between them.\n\nApollo stepped closer, his bare feet sinking into the soft riverbank. His skin glowed, kissed by the sun's fire. Hyacinthus watched, breathless, as the god's fingers trailed along his jawline, leaving trails of warmth in their wake. The prince's pulse quickened; he had never felt such longing.\n\n\"Hyacinthus,\" Apollo murmured, his voice like a distant melody. \"You are unlike any mortal I've known. Your spirit dances with the wind, your laughter rivaling the song of the lyre.\"\n\nHyacinthus dared to meet Apollo's gaze. The god's lips curved into a half-smile, and at that moment, the world narrowed to just the two of them--the prince and the sun god, bound by fate and desire.\n\nApollo leaned in, his breath warm against Hyacinthus's skin. The prince's heart hammered, and he closed his eyes, surrendering to the inevitable. Their lips met--a collision of fire and water, mortal and divine. It was a kiss that transcended time and space, a union of sun and earth.\n\nHyacinthus tasted sunlight and eternity upon his tongue. Apollo's mouth moved against his, gentle yet insistent. The god's fingers tangled in his hair, pulling him closer, stealing his breath. Hyacinthus' skin was aflame, his veins molten. He leaned closer to the god, unable to get enough. The river whispered its secrets, and the reeds bowed in reverence.\n\nAs they broke apart, Hyacinthus gasped for air. Apollo's eyes bore into his, filled with longing and tenderness.\n\n\"I am bound by duty and my domains,\" the god confessed.\n\n\"But in this stolen moment, let us forget the heavens and the mortal world. Let us be.\"\n\nAnd so, by the banks of the Euphrates, Prince Hyacinthus and Apollo shared their first kiss and then more --a love forbidden yet inevitable. The sun dipped lower, casting their shadows upon the water, etching their story into the fabric of time.\n\nIn that fleeting embrace, they defied the fates and became legends--the prince who dared to love a sun god, and the sun god who burned for a mortal. And as the stars emerged, their love blazed brighter than any constellation, forever imprinted upon the river's ancient currents. Apollo held his love and stopped listening to the threads of fate.\n\n \n\nThe next day, Hyacinthus was greeted by his grandmother Memnosyne, the Titaness of Memory. She had a quest for him. The elder Titaness had a hidden sanctuary in Laconia, very close to one of the tributaries of the Eurotas River. One of the sacred pools had spilled into the river. The waters of memory had spread across the Eurotas. Memnosyne was keeping the effects suppressed, but soon she could not. Memories of times past, memories too dangerous for the human mind, would spread, and Laconia would be in danger. She had a request of a mortal hero, her demigod grandson.\n\nMemnosyne's sacred pools of memory were hidden deep within a secret sanctuary in the heart of the forest, shimmering with reflections of forgotten ages. Each pool held fragments of time--moments of joy, sorrow, love, and loss. But disaster struck one fateful day as she tended to her pools. A tremor shook the earth, and a pool cracked, its waters spilling forth into a nearby tributary of the Eurotas River.\n\n \n\nThe memory waters flowed downstream, winding through the kingdom set to be inherited by Prince Hyacinthus, Clio's son and Memnosyne's beloved grandson. These waters were no ordinary streams; they carried memories so potent that even a single touch could unravel a mortal's mind. Those who accidentally brushed against them would lose themselves, their sanity slipping away like sand through their fingers.\n\n \n\nMemnosyne knew the danger. She stood by the riverbank, her ancient eyes watching as villagers stumbled, their gazes vacant, their minds adrift. She wove invisible threads of suppression, trying to hold back the madness. But her powers were waning, and the waters resisted her efforts. She would not be able to keep the effects at bay for long. She needed a cure, and she knew that she could not recover the cure herself. What would counteract the liquid memories was its opposite, water from the Lethe.\n\n \n\nDesperation gnawed at her heart. She needed the water of the Lethe--a remedy that could mend the fractured minds due to her broken pool. And there was only one place to find it: the underworld, where the River Lethe flowed--an abyss of forgetfulness that erased memories like ink washed from parchment. All souls drank from there due to being reborn, forgetting who they were in preparation for a new life. Or unfortunate nymphs and daemons of the Underworld got splashed and forgot who they were.\n\nMemnosyne was not allowed into the Underworld. It was the domain of another and getting official permission would take too long. Hades, her nephew, god, and king of the underworld, nursed grudges passionately. Memnosyne had long been allied to Olympus, her daughters and their golden master. Hades would enjoy toying with her, delaying her until disaster struck. Even if Zeus were inclined to be indulgent out of fondness for their past dalliance, this would be too great a transgression. Hera would harangue him until Zeus decided on harsh punishment for Memnosyne and maybe even her daughters.\nThe Elder Titaness needed a demigod. They were caught between mortal and divine and were free to go everywhere as long as they were able and willing to deal with the consequences.\n\nMemnosyne sought out her grandson, Prince Hyacinthus. She found him in his palace garden, observing the gentle sussurus of a small fountain. The titaness approached the demigod, who rose to his feet to greet her respectfully. Memnosyne observed the boy she had not seen since he was a babe in Clio's breast. Hyacinthus did not disappoint at first glance.\n\nStrong, clever and beautiful, he bore the grace of both gods and mortals. His purple eyes shone with curiosity at her unusual presence, eyes inherited from his mother, her beloved daughter Clio. When she told him of the memory waters and their dire effects, he listened, his brow furrowing. He was the crown prince of Sparta. The disaster was poised to strike his kingdom. Hyacinthus would not fail her.\n\"Grandmother,\" Hyacinthus said, bowing respectfully.\n\n\"Why have you come?\"\n\nThe Titaness spoke softly, her voice a whisper carried by the wind.\n\n\"Hyacinthus, my dear grandson, trouble brews in your kingdom. One of my sacred pools of memory has spilled into the Eurotas, poisoning its waters. Those who accidentally touch it go mad, their minds unravelling like ancient scrolls.\"\n\nHyacinthus frowned. \"But how can I help, Grandmother?\"\n\nMemnosyne's eyes bore into his.\n\n\"There is a cure--the Lethe, the river of forgetfulness that flows in the underworld. Its waters erase memories, granting oblivion. You must descend into the depths, retrieve the Lethe's essence, and save your people.\"\n\nHyacinthus hesitated. The underworld was treacherous, its shadows concealing forgotten sorrows, lost dreams, and many monsters. Yet, he was a prince of Sparta, chosen to be the next king. Duty called, and he knew he must act.\n\n\"Grandmother,\" Hyacinthus said, \"I will descend into the underworld. I will brave the shadows and seek the River Lethe.\"\n\n \n\n\"You will not!\" Spoke up Apollo, emerging from Hyacinthus' private quarters.\n\n\"The underworld is too dangerous. I can't reach there!\"\n\nMemnosyne gawked at her grandnephew, utterly astonished to see him near her grandson. She looked at Hyacinthus in question; the boy blushed sweetly as Apollo approached her. Memnosyne focused on the sun god.\n\nApollo kept a tight lid on his divinity out of fear of harming Hyacinthus, but Memnosyne could see the rage in his eyes. The Titaness swallowed as eyes the colour of spilled ichor met hers. Memories of her tyrannical brother came unbidden. She also recalled a prophecy, made about Zeus' Titan queen, Metis, and the children she would have. A daughter, glorious and wise and a son, greater than his father. Zeus had devoured her niece to stop the prophecy but Athena had still been born. Memnosyne privately wondered if that prophecy was about Metis at all. Leto after all had borne Zeus a glorious daughter and then a son. A son who held so many domains and was the strongest god of his generation.\n\n\"Apollo,\" Hyacinthus spoke.\n\n\"It is my kingdom. This could destroy Sparta. I need to do my duty.\"\n\nApollo shook his head in denial, caring only for the life and safety of his lover. Memnsyne thought it prudent to interfere. She stepped closer, taking their hands in hers, her touch like ancient parchment.\n\n\"Love and duty often clash my dear ones. But remember this: Sparta's fate rests upon your shoulders. The Lethe's cure awaits, hidden in the underworld.\"\n\nApollo looked at Hyacinthus and read the resolve in his eyes.\n\n\"There is no talking you out of this, my love?\"\n\nThe god's voice had something very close to pleading in it. Hyacinthus looked sad, but he denied it.\n\n\"I have to protect my kingdom. I vowed to do so when my Father the King placed the crown of Lelex on my head to make me his heir and Sparta's future king.\"\n\nApollo scowled, hearing truth and conviction in his voice.\n\n\"Very well. I will take you there.\"\n\nMemnosyne blinked in alarm.\n\n\"Apollo!\" The Elder Titaness scolded.\n\n\"You can't go into the underworld. Hades will declare war and your father will be wroth!\"\n\nApollo glared at Memnosyne. No god liked to be reminded that even they had limitations, rules to abide by. That there were places they could not go.\n\n\"I will get him to the entrance. I know that he must go on his own.\"\n\nSatisfied that the cure was forthcoming and Apollo would not break divine law, Memnosyne left after giving Hyacinthus an enchanted pitcher with a waxed lid for the Lethe water. Hyacinthus went to his quarters to prepare. Apollo followed him and observed Hyacinthus take a fine leather satchel and begin packing supplies.\n\nThe first thing to go in was Memnosyne's pitcher, followed by weapons. Spying a plate of spiced honey cakes, Hyacinthus wrapped them in a clean cloth and packed them, too. That drew a noise of surprise from Apollo. Hyacinthus gave a tremulous smile at the god.\n\n\"For your uncle's dog,\" Hyacithus explained, making Apollo frown.\n\nHyacinthus strained his memory for knowledge of prior katabasis. Every person who descended to the underworld took something of value with them as an offering to Hades. Frowning, he looked around his quarters to find something of enough value. Hades was the god of wealth; precious metals, gemstones. As a prince Hyacinthus owned quite a lot of jewelry to adorn himself with and show off his kingdom's might and wealth. Unfortunately, jewelry would not be enough.\n\nHyacinthus caught sight of a fine box of ivory decorated with pearls. A very expensive trinket that his mother had gifted him on his fifteenth birthday. Clio had commissioned it from Hephaestus. It was the most luxurious item that Hyacinthus owned. In it, he kept incense and vials of perfume. He grabbed the box and packed it as well. It would do as an offering to Hades. Not only it was a rare and expensive item, but Hyacinthus was also attached to it due to being from his mother.\n\nApollo made his preparations. He called his chariot and retrieved a glowing golden rope. Hyacinthus eyed the rope curiously as he climbed in Apollo's chariot. His lover noticed his curiosity.\n\n\"A safeguard. I will tie you to it to measure your progress in the underworld. After you have collected the water, you will activate it, and I will be able to bring you back to me.\"\n\nApollo showed Hyacinthus a gem at the end of the rope. Hyacithus was to press hard on it, and it would turn the rope from gold to ruby red. That way, Apollo would know when the mission was over.\n\n \n\nPrince Hyacinthus stood at the precipice of the Underworld, his heart resolute. Sparta, his beloved kingdom, teetered on the brink of ruin. If he failed, his grandmother would be unable to hold off the effects of the memory pools, and madness would fall. The solution lay before him: the Lethe, the river of forgetfulness. It would counteract the effects of his grandmother's waters, saving his people and what his ancestors had built.\n\nApollo, his lover and the god of prophecy had whispered the secret to him.\n\n\"Descend into the depths, Hyacinthus,\"\n\nApollo's voice echoed in his mind.\n\n\"Retrieve the Lethe water, and Sparta shall be safe again. Be careful, don't take unnecessary risks.\"\n\nHyacinthus adjusted the golden rope around his waist--the very rope that bound him to Apollo's love and power. With a deep breath, he stepped into the shadowed realm where his lover could not follow, guided by Apollo's counsel:\n\n\"Ignore the souls that seek to divert you from your purpose.\"\n\nThe air grew colder, and the ground shifted beneath his sandals. Soon, he encountered Cereberos--the three-headed guardian of the Underworld. The beast's eyes glowed with hunger, but Hyacinthus knew how to reach to his heart. Every dog's heart could be reached with treats and affection. He produced the spiced honey cakes--a Spartan delicacy and a favourite treat--and offered it to the fearsome creature.\n\n\"Good Cereberos,\" Hyacinthus cooed, scratching behind each head's ear, smiling as if he were with his dogs.\n\n\"Please accept this gift, and let me pass.\"\n\nCereberos wagged its tails, devouring the cake. The prince's love for dogs softened even the fiercest guardian. With a nod, Cereberos allowed him onward. Hyacinthus gave him one final pat and walked away.\n\nAs Hyacinthus neared the Lethe, the air thickened with sorrow. Two spectral figures emerged--Diomede and Aristodamia, his stepmothers. Their eyes blazed with resentment.\n\n\"Hyacinthus,\" Diomede's voice in death dripped venom just as it had in life.\n\n\"You ruined my life. Your birth stole my husband's love.\"\n\nHyacinthus squared his shoulders. As Apollo had advised, he could not feel pity or regret for the shades that would confront him.\n\n\"I was but a babe then, innocent and unknowing. I never wronged you. Your misery and death were your own doing.\"\n\nAristodamia's ethereal form quivered.\n\n\"Your beauty inflamed me, stepson. I lost my sanity to desire. Even gods can't resist you; how could I!\"\n\nHyacinthus met her gaze.\n\n\"I was still a child by the laws of the land, Aristodamia. Your lust was your undoing.\"\n\nThe ghosts recoiled, defeated. Hyacinthus pressed forward, but a new presence awaited him: Melinoe, the goddess of ghosts. She was not so easily thwarted. Her pale grey, almost white eyes bore into his soul. Her pitch-black hair hung limp upon her pale shoulders. Her mouth was very red, crimson, like freshly spilled blood. Hyacinthus could spy very white, very sharp teeth. Her gown reminded him of funeral linens.\n\"Why are you not haunted by your ghosts?\"\n\nMelinoe's voice held a hint of annoyance. Her face, beautiful just like all goddesses, was marred by a scowl.\n\nHyacinthus bowed respectfully to the daughter of Hades and Persephone.\n\n\"I seek peace with the dead, not vengeance.\"\n\nMelinoe's calculating gaze fell on the golden chain, and the annoyance wiped from her face.\n\n\"Apollo's mark upon you. A devoted lover, indeed.\"\n\nHyacinthus had a feeling that this would go a lot worse for him if Apollo's affection and favour weren't wrapped around him.\n\n\"Praise Apollo,\" Hyacinthus murmured.\n\n\"Guide me, goddess.\"\n\nMelinoe stepped aside, allowing him to approach the Lethe. Its waters shimmered, memories dissolving like honey in hot water. Hyacinthus filled his pitcher and stopped it safely with the waxed lid, but before he could ascend, he pressed the red gem on the chain, turning it from gold to red--a signal to Apollo.\nIn an instant, the Underworld vanished, and Hyacinthus was yanked upward. The world blurred, and he emerged on the sunlit edge. Apollo stood there, eyes aflame with love and worry.\n\n\"You risked much, my beloved prince,\" Apollo said, pulling him close.\n\n\"But Sparta shall be safe.\"\n\nApollo gently pried the pitcher from his hands and vanished it with a gesture, sending it to Grandmother Memnosyne.\n\nHyacinthus kissed him, tasting sunlight. Apollo broke the kiss.\n\n\"I need to check you. The underworld is foul and everything there is toxic and dangerous to the living. Even a scratch gained there could do you severe harm.\"\nBefore Hyacinthus could protest, the god undid the pin on his chiton, removed the cloth, and left the prince bare. To his surprise, Hyacinthus did not want to cover himself; he let Apollo inspect him with no heed or worry.\n\nApollo seemed to have the urge to feel every inch of skin to ensure there was no damage or poison on Hyacinthus' skin. A few light scratches from rolling about with Cereberos were pretty much it, which the god insisted on healing with prejudice. Apollo's hot fingers caused shivers to go down the prince's spine, and he could feel his body heat up that familiar way. Hyacinthus swallowed, feeling sweat beading up. Apollo's hands crept lower, and the god smiled and leaned closer to his beloved prince. Hyacinthus moved forward to meet him halfway, dazzled by his feelings and Apollo's divine beauty.\n\nMuch later, a deliciously sore and exhausted Hyacinthus rested in his chambers, lying in his bath. Several attendants bustled around him, looking curiously at the marks on the prince's skin. Marks that they had not seen before but knew what were. One attendant, whom Hyacinthus had trouble recalling the name, seethed with rage. The prince raised his eyebrows as all the attendants filed out of the room, leaving just that angry attendant.\n\n\"I don't recall your name,\" Hyacinthus told the attendant, his hand hovering over the hidden dagger at the edge of the bath.\n\nThanks to Diomede, he had developed the habit of keeping a dagger under his pillow, by the bath, and anywhere else he could be vulnerable.\n\nThe attendant sneered, and his humble disguise melted. Zephyrus stood before Hyacinthus.\n\n\"Apollo? You rejected me but accepted Apollo?\"\n\nThe god's furious accusation caused a small maelstrom of wind inside the bathing chamber, causing oil amphoras and ceramic pitchers to fall violently against the walls and shatter loudly. Hyacinthus flinched.\n\n\"I rejected you because you are married. I can't get involved in adultery. Apollo is not married, and neither am I.\"\n\nZephyrus laughed.\n\n\"You expect me to believe that!\"\n\n\"And not because he is enthroned on Olymps and is the son of the king of the gods!\"\n\nHyacinthus' jaw dropped at the accusation.\n\n\"I love Apollo,\" Hyacinthus told Zephyrus, a confession that seemed to enrage the god more because his eyes turned pitch black.\n\nZephyrus advanced toward the prince but was stopped by a strong, tanned hand on his shoulder. The West Wind turned around to meet Apollo's furious golden eyes.\n\n\"Zephyrus. Why are you bothering my lover?\" Apollo spoke with a voice that heralded disaster.\n\nThe wind god was momentarily speechless, not expecting the sun god to show up to defend the prince.\n\n\"He rejected me out of his pride and sympathy for Hera.\"\n\nHyacinthus felt the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose. Zephyrus seemed determined to make himself loathed by the prince.\n\nApollo's hand on Zephyrus's shoulder tightened.\n\n\"Prince Hyacinthus was rebuilding a temple to appease an Olympian goddess after she had been greatly offended. Giving the queen of the gods her due is not hubris.\"\n\nZephyrus turned to stare at Hyacinthus, who resolutely turned his head up and stared at the ceiling, desperately wishing to be elsewhere and not listen to two gods argue about him.\n\n\"Begone Zephyrus! And never approach my lover again,\" Apollo declared, dragging Zephyrus out of the chamber and throwing him out of Hyacinthus' quarters. He returned to the prince and found Hyacinthus getting out of the bath. Apollo took a linen cloth to help Hyacinthus dry himself.\n\n\"If he appears to you again, pray to me immediately, my love,\" Apollo urged, cupping the prince's jaw and smoothing his curls away from his forehead.\n\n\"Much like his mother he likes the look of what does not belong to him and he has a terrible temper.\"\n\nHyacinthus nodded as Apollo embraced him, wishing to never see Zephyrus again.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTale of Icarus\n\n \n\nArtemis, the chaste huntress, watched with veiled eyes in the shadowed groves of ancient Crete. Her wrath had been kindled by Aura's insolence, the nymph's mocking words echoing through the forest.\n\n\"Artemis, a virgin? Impossible,\" Aura had sneered after Polyboea had sent Icarus away, Aura's laughter like the rustling leaves. Artemis' sole comfort was that the boy she had raised was not there to listen to such filth.\n\n\"Look at your buxom form, your lush curves. Surely, Orion has tasted your forbidden fruit. Why else would your twin brother take such wroth and risk offending Gaea, Poseidon and Tartarus?\"\n\nArtemis, protector of purity, could not abide such impudence. She sought out Dionysus, the god of revelry, and struck a reckless bargain with him.\n\n\"I Withdraw my shield from Aura,\" she whispered to Dionysus, \"and let her fall into the hands of desire.\"\n\nAnd so it was done. Dionysus, cunning and capricious, assumed the guise of a maiden, his wine-laden goblet a treacherous gift. Aura, disarmed by the illusion and trusting a charmingly smiling maiden, drank deeply. The intoxicating potion blurred her senses and sapped her strength, and Dionysus took her, leaving her violated and abandoned. Artemis felt filthy as she watched. The first stirring of uncomfortable regret was in her heart.\n\nWhen the haze lifted, Aura's rage consumed her. She knew not the identity of her assailant, only that her body had been defiled. What she valued most, her virginity, was taken, gone forever. Her wrath became a tempest, and she hunted the men and boys of the forest. Their screams echoed through the trees as Aura's blade found them one by one. Artemis watched, unseen, her heart torn between vengeance and remorse.\n\nBut the Titaness's fury did not wane. She tore at her flesh, desperate to expel the seed of violation. She punched her belly, gnawed on poisonous herbs, and hurled herself from cliffs. Yet her womb remained swollen, unnatural, pulsing with life. The children within were no mere mortals--they were gods, begotten in darkness.\n\nAs the moon waxed and waned, Aura's torment intensified. Her screams pierced the night, mingling with the cries of her victims. Finally, the moment arrived--the birthing of gods. Her waters broke, and she writhed on the forest floor, torn between agony and madness.\n\nTwin boys emerged, slick and otherworldly. Aura seized one, her teeth sinking into his tender flesh. Golden ichor flowed, and she devoured him, her eyes wild and feral. The taste of divinity filled her mouth, and she howled like a wounded beast.\n\nArtemis, invisible but ever watchful, hesitated. Her vengeance had birthed this horror. She could not undo what was done, but she could save the remaining child. She snatched the second twin before Aura could, cradling him. His skin glowed with celestial light, and his eyes held the wisdom of ages.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" Artemis whispered to the infant.\n\n\"I am both protector and destroyer.\"\n\nShe vanished into the forest, carrying the god-child away from Aura's madness. The Titaness's anguished cries followed her, a lament for lost innocence and shattered lives. Artemis paused, with the godly child in her arms, to look at the boy's broken mother. The goddess of the hunt closed her eyes in anguish and focused her divine will upon Aura. Artemis transformed her cousin into a stream of water. She made the water the purest that could be found, one last grace fueled by deep, bitter regret. She should have done this in the first place, not struck that accursed bargain and inflicted such abomination upon Aura, a sworn maiden. But Artemis could not undo what had been done; she could only make amends and regret this forever.\n\nArtemis looked down at the infant in her arms, the boy gazing back at her with loathing. The surviving twin, named Iacchus, would find solace with Demeter, the nurturing goddess of the harvest. He would grow into a nature deity in her arms, welcomed in autumn and winter when Persephone descended to the Underworld. Artemis had chosen mercy over vengeance at the very end, but the echoes of Aura's rage would forever haunt the ancient woods. The death of her first twin would forever haunt Iacchus, and he would be unable to stand the very sight of Artemis or even his father.\n\n \n\nHeart heavy, Artemis returned to her huntresses. She refused to speak of Aura, and her companions did not ask questions. Polyboea was worried about Icarus, so Artemis checked on the boy. Icarus was not found at his father's house, Minos' palace, or anywhere in Knossos but at a sunlit beach. To Artemis' worry and astonishment, Apollo was with him. The two of them, god and boy, race each other through the sands, jumping into the sea and splashing the other with water.\n\nNo, Artemis could not believe her eyes. How had Apollo found Icarus? She shielded the boy to ensure that Apollo did not catch sight of him and whisk him away. Apollo was supposed to be distracted by Heracles' trials, not galivant in Crete. Last Artemis had heard, Apollo had been distracted by a woman, an Acacallis. Artemis vaguely recalled a nymph by that name that Apollo had been fond of long ago and had several sons with her.\n\nShe assumed that he had gone back to her. Too late, she recalled that one of Princess Ariadne's sisters was called Acacallis. The most beautiful of Pasiphae's daughters and the most vain and cruel. Icarus strongly disliked her; that boy had a sweet nature and a gentle heart. The only other woman Artemis had heard Icarus say a bad word about was Medea, the cruel sorceress who murdered her children.\n\nArtemis punched a tree in frustration. Apollo must have chanced upon Icarus when visiting Minos' eldest daughter. Artemis extended her senses to find Acacallis. The princess was locked up in her rooms, hiding a pregnancy from her father, pretending to be ill. Acacallis was listening to a report from her serving woman. Apollo had only visited the princess for a few nights in secret, but was spending entire weeks constantly with Icarus, letting everyone see how he favoured the inventor's son.\n\nUnable to wrest her brother away from the darling child she had raised, Artemis focused on the problem she could solve. The goddess of the Hunt appeared to Princess Acacallis.\n\nArtemis's presence in the royal chambers was greeted with gasps of astonishment, and the serving women and the royal princess fell to their knees in reverence. Artemis gestured for Acacallis to raise her head.\n\n\"You welcomed my brother in your bed and are now pregnant with his son.\"\n\nAcacallis swallowed.\n\n\"I am but a mortal woman. I can't refuse a god if he demands my maidenhood.\" The princess simpered.\n\nArtemis scowled. She saw Acacallis' thoughts. The princess was proud that her beauty had attracted a god. Her only regret was that Apollo did not stay with her longer and did not announce the affair to all of sundry. The princess' pride was deeply hurt that she had been forgotten, cast aside as Apollo found someone else and gave him everything Acacallis wanted.\n\nAcacallis read Artemis's disdain and disbelief and lowered her head again.\n\n\"I could not care less that you have dallied with my brother. My concern is that you think that you can strike at Icarus to soothe your injured pride.\"\n\nAcacallis bit her lip, shaking in fear.\n\n\"Seems that you have forgotten, but Icarus has had my favour since he was four years old and never has disappointed me. It is very rare for me to find a male worthy of may favour but do not believe that I would hesitate to protect him or avenge him if he is wronged. Just like I would do for my maidens.\"\n\nAcacallis clenched her fists, swallowing thickly, feeling tears pooling in her eyes.\n\n\"I will do him no harm, goddess.\" The princess spoke.\n\nArtemis glared at the princess for one long minute.\n\n\"Eat more; do not starve my nephew in your jealousy and anger.\"\n\nThe goddess vanished, leaving a resentful princess behind. Acacallis walked to the window and saw the sun outside. She knew that beyond the palace walls, her former lover was wooing the inventor's son, having forgotten her. She was left abandoned, a very inconvenient child in her womb. Once the baby was born, she would have her serving women expose him. She had no proof that the child was Apollo's, and her father would be unhappy either way. Yet another female in his family caused scandal and shame.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~\nModern times:\n\nPercy Jackson stood on the world's edge--or at least, it felt that way. Yancy Academy had been her refuge, a place where she could have at least one good friend and a decent teacher, where her dyslexia and ADHD didn't ruin everything for her. But now, the principal had clarified that this was her last year here. No more Yancy. No more sixth grade. No more pretending to be just another kid. To her deep disappointment, Mr. Brunner and Grover teamed up to make her believe that Mrs. Dodds, the monster teacher, had never existed and that Percy had imagined her out of stress. Percy had overheard them talking about Mrs. Dodds, but they kept insisting that Percy was crazy. It was disappointing and very disheartening.\n\nShe packed her bags, leaving behind the echoing hallways and the scent of chalk dust. Her mom's apartment awaited her--a cramped space with peeling wallpaper and a flickering light bulb. But before she could escape, there was one last thing to do: a photoshoot.\n\nThe stylist and photographer were waiting for her at the beach. They had a vision--a fusion of ancient Greece and modern fashion. Chitons and peplos inspired their designs, flowing garments that whispered of gods and myths. And Percy was their muse. She recalled Mr. Brunner's lessons when he covered the Muses. Percy's favourite was Clio. History, for some reason, had always come easily to her. The dates and events are easy to remember, the subject is easy to focus on. Her dyslexia eased ever so slightly whenever it was a history book in her hands. She had Clio's Mythomagic card, but would have to see if there was a figurine as well.\n\nThe stylist and photographer led her to a giant ceramic scallop shell half-buried in the sand.\n\n\"Pose,\" they instructed. \"Sell us the ethereal creature rising from the sea vibe.\"\n\nSo Percy posed. She stretched her arms, her fingers grazing the edges of the shell. The sun kissed her skin, and the wind tangled her hair. Hours passed, and the camera clicked relentlessly. She felt like a nymph, a sea sprite, something otherworldly. Her worries were gone, just the gentle sound of the waves, the delightful salt-scented breeze, and the sunlight on her skin. Percy found it easy to smile and almost dance with joy.\n\nBut then, with a resounding crack, the ceramic shell shattered under her feet. Pain shot through her foot, but she gritted her teeth and continued. The show must go on, after all. Galaxaura, her agent, finally noticed her bleeding foot and forced her to get treatment. Percy wondered if she'd ever feel so carefree and happy again.\n\nAfter the photoshoot, she trudged to her mother's apartment, her foot wrapped with bandages. The familiar smell of Gabe's unwashed socks and cheap cigars hit her like a punch. Percy scowled in disgust, trying not to breathe too deeply. Gabe and his poker buddies were sprawled around the table, their laughter grating on her nerves. One of them--Larry, or maybe Lou--ogled her shamelessly. Percy's disgust was palpable.\n\nThen, like a beacon of sanity, Sally Jackson arrived. Her mom's smile was a lifeline, pulling Percy away from the chaos. They packed their bags for Montauk--their annual summer getaway. Percy glanced at the weather forecast. Rain, thunderstorms, and gray skies. She rolled her eyes and sarcastically prayed to the sea god for better weather.\n\nTo her utter astonishment, the clouds dispersed, revealing a brilliant blue sky. Percy rationalized it as coincidence, but she could not help but take out the Mythomagic cards. Sally frowned when she saw Percy holding up Poseidon's card but said nothing.\n\nAs they strolled along the boardwalk, Percy bought an ice cream from a man who looked like a walking fashion disaster. Hawaiian shirt, khaki shorts, beach sandals--the whole package. His hat read \"Neptune.\" He noticed her scowl and asked,\n\n\"Why such a lovely girl with such a stormy expression?\"\n\nPercy hesitated, looking at her mother reading on a beach chair, then spilled her woes. The horrible mood swings since December, the gaslighting by her teacher and best friend. The man winced, guilt flickering in his eyes.\n\n\"Stay strong,\" he said. \"Endure.\"\n\n\"Endure should have been my middle name instead of Marina,\" Percy retorted. \"I've endured my whole life. It'll only get worse.\"\n\nThe man's gaze held regret, as if he knew more than he let on. \"Sometimes strength comes from enduring the impossible,\" he murmured. \"And sometimes, the sea answers prayers.\"\n\nPercy scoffed, but as she walked, the sun warmed her skin, and the waves whispered secrets. Maybe, just maybe, there was more to her story than she realized. The man's eyes followed her, filled with a strange mix of pity and longing.\n\nAnd Percy wondered if she was more than just a girl with a injured foot and a chip on her shoulder.\n\nSolon, son of Apollo, laughs at the perfect prince who is so dense that he mistakes signs of being in love with having an illness.Hyacinthus: I want to bang your dad.\n\nMemnosyne: Proving that gods get demigods to clean up their messes since at least 1300 BC\n\nMelinoe wants to punish this mortal that can throw off her power, but Apollo is a very powerful and wrathful god, and she does not dare to slight him.\n\nArtemis: Is this what regrets feels like? Insight 10+Also Artemis: This unwed pregnant woman with an abusive father wants to hurt my follower out of jealousy? Lets threaten her.\n\nPoseidon: Lets check on my kid (whom I swore a sacred oath not to have) and give her free ice cream and cryptic advice. My fatherly quota met for a year.\n\nClio sees something no mother want to see.\n\nIcarus grows closer to Apollo. Artemis explains herself.\n\nHow Will came to be\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nThe muse Clio, the goddess of History, loved no one as much as her one and only son. She had wished to raise him alone, but it was not to be. Her father, the mightly king of the gods, had decreed that no mortal might live on Olympus, and Clio had been forced to give up her heart's treasure. Thanks to support from Demeter, the muse obtained the right to visit her son often, but it was never enough. She was so busy with her duties a few times that she had to go for months without visiting her son. She never dared to shirk. Her father and stepmother would love the chance to strip Clio of her rights to her child. Hyacinthus, the sweet boy, always understood, even though he was sad.\n\nShe had to stay away for too long after her son's fifteenth birthday. Mainly because she had to have talks with her aunt Rhea and secure her support in case that horrid wind god tried to seize her son. Clio knew her father. Zeus would not bestir himself for a mortal. Not when the other party was a god. While another Olympian could influence him, the safest bet was Rhea. Zeus would do anything to keep his mother happy except stop cheating on his wife. If Clio had Rhea in her corner, Hyacinthus would be safe from unwanted godly suitors. After she felt that she had made good progress in endearing her aunt to her, Clio could visit her son. Hopefully, her darling child was not too upset with her long absence.\n\nAs it was her habit, the muse appeared directly in her son's quarters. Clio smiled as she looked at the familiar surroundings. She looked at the shelves filled with delightful pottery, scrolls of poetry and history, chests of clothing, and the tapestries and mosaics decorating her son's rooms. She frowned as she noticed items that had not been there before.\n\nA new mosaic, depicting her son and also her lord Apollo hunting a boar. A tapestry, showing Hyacinthus in the underworld, facing Melinoe. Clio's eyes widened. What had gone in her son's life while she was absent? Her purple eyes noted other differences. A new large pithos showing the battle between Apollo and the Python and near it, a life-size statue of Apollo. This was turning into a theme, a theme that Clio very much did not like.\n\nShe had been absent from her son for months so she could secure support to keep one god away from him, and another took advantage of that absence. Apollo had always been disinterested when she spoke of her son, why was he inserting himself in Hyacinthus' life?\nConfused and more than a little upsent, Clio burst into her son's bedroom to get answers.\n\n \n\nThe door creaked open. Clio, the muse of history, peered into the dimly lit room. Her eyes widened as they saw her son, Hyacinthus, asleep in his bed. But he was not alone. Beside him lay Apollo, the god of music and prophecy, his golden curls spilling over the pillow, his tanned, muscular arm draped over her son's waist.\n\nA surge of fury welled up within Clio. She stormed into the room, her voice echoing through the silent halls.\n\n\"Apollo! What is the meaning of this?\"\n\nThe two figures on the bed stirred. Hyacinthus woke up, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment as he realized his mother had discovered him in bed with his lover. Apollo, however, remained calm. He sat up, his eyes meeting Clio's with a serene gaze.\n\n \n\n\"Clio,\" he began, his voice soothing, \"there is no need for anger. I assure you, everything is all right.\"\n\nHyacinthus looked between his mother and Apollo, his heart pounding. He had never intended for his mother to find out about his relationship with Apollo in such a manner. He had hoped to have a calm discussion with her and break the news gently. Yet, despite the awkwardness of the situation, Apollo's reassurance brought him a sense of comfort.\n\nClio, however, was far from appeased. She turned to Apollo, her eyes blazing with a mother's protective fury.\n\n\"What are you thinking, Apollo? Why are you pursuing my son?\"\n\nBefore Apollo could respond, Hyacinthus spoke up, wanting to defend his lover. Apollo was nothing like Zephyrus.\n\n\"Mother, I... I am in love with Apollo. His advances are not unwanted.\"\n\nClio looked at her son, her anger giving way to worry. She knew of Apollo's reputation. He was known to be capricious, often forgetting and abandoning his lovers. She feared her son would end up heartbroken.\n\nApollo, sensing Clio's worry, spoke up.\n\n\"Clio, I assure you, my feelings for Hyacinthus are genuine. I am deeply in love with him and have no intention of leaving him.\"\n\nClio was not easily convinced. She reminded Apollo of his past relationships, particularly his short-lived affair with the goatherd Branchus and the even briefer affair with Adonis. Apollo, however, was quick to defend himself.\n\n\"Branchus was a passing fancy, Clio. I was not in love with him.The same is true for Adonis. The only person I have ever truly loved, other than Hyacinthus, was Daphne. And in Daphne's case, I was struck by Eros's arrow. My love for Hyacinthus is sincere and genuine. As the god of prophecy, I know it will last forever.\"\n\nClio was silent, her mind filled with thoughts and worries. But looking at Apollo, at the sincerity in his eyes, she could not help but feel a glimmer of hope. Perhaps, just perhaps, this might work out after all. For Hyacinthus's sake, she hoped it would.\n\nClio looked into her little boy's eyes. Hyacinthus looked at her with worry, biting his lip as he looked between her and his lover. Clio's heart softened. She could not hurt her son by making him choose between his mother and his lover. Despite her misgivings, she will give them her blessing. But she would remain vigilant and be ready to act if Apollo was wrong about the strength of his feelings, leaving her son heartbroken.\n\nShe thought back at Apollo's confidence that he would love Hyacinthus forever. That should be reassuring to a mother, but it worried her more. What if Hyacinthus fell out of love? He was young and youth could be fickle. They might declare eternal love one day and fall out of love in less than a moon's turn. Would Apollo be accepting in this case? Terrified, Clio decided to ask.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo, you are the god of prophecy. You may know you will love Hyacinthus forever, but he is young. His feelings might change. What will you do if Hyacinthus stops loving you? Will you kidnap and lock him up like Hades did with Persephone? Will my son be trapped in Delos while I scour the world for him like Demeter did?\"\n\nApollo shook his head, his golden curls catching the light.\n\n\"Clio, I am not Hades. I would never force Hyacinthus to stay with me against his will. I will let him go if he leaves, even if it breaks my heart.\"\n\nClio looked at her son, then at Apollo, her expression softening slightly. She knew she couldn't control her son's heart, but she only hoped that Apollo was telling the truth. She would have to trust her son's judgment and Apollo's words. But she would always be there, ready to protect her son should he ever need her.\n\nHyacinthus called for breakfast, and his attendants brought enough for the prince and the two gods. Hyacithus guided his mother and lover to the table in his receiving room as a proper host. The table was laden with flatbreads, boiled eggs, cheese, olives, olive oil, wine, water, and fruit. All three of them ate with gusto, making light conversation before Hyacinthus had to leave to attend to his princely duties.\n\nClio and Apollo were left alone. They eyed each other with unease for a few long moments.\n\n\"Clio, why does worry cloud your radiant face?\" Apollo asked, noticing her distress.\n\n\"It's about Hyacinthus, my son,\"\n\nClio confessed, her voice trembling.\n\n\"Zephyrus, the god of the west wind, has developed an obsession for him. His advances are unwanted, and Hyacinthus, being averse to adultery, and any other type of betrayal, is deeply disturbed. Zephyrus is married, yet he disregards his vows.\"\n\nClio's eyes welled up with fear as she continued, \"I fear Zephyrus might resort to force or even kidnap Hyacinthus.\"\n\nUnderstanding her fears, Apollo reassured her.\n\n\"Clio, I love Hyacinthus. I will not let any harm befall him.\"\n\nBut Clio's fears were not easily assuaged.\n\n\"Apollo, Zephyrus is a god too. He is not bound by mortal laws any more than we are.\"\n\nApollo, seeing her persistent worry, reminded her of his stature.\n\n\"Clio, remember, I am one of the Twelve. I have a throne on Olympus. The wind god does not. My power is not to be underestimated. Zephyrus will not dare to touch my beloved.\"\n\nHis words echoed in the silent halls of Hyacinthus' palace, a promise of protection, a vow of love. Apollo's assurance brought a glimmer of hope to Clio's worried eyes. Yet, only time will tell if Zephyrus will heed Apollo's warning. Still, Clio dared to hope. Maybe Zephyrus would be frightened off and stay away from her son. Maybe her son, as Apollo's beloved, will join her in immortality, and she would never have to lose him to Hades. But why did her heart feel so heavy?\n\n \n\nIn the grand halls of the Spartan palace, Prince Hyacinthus, the beloved son of King Amyclas, prepared to introduce his lover to his father. Clio, his mother, already knew about it. It was only fair to introduce his father to his lover properly. His heart pounded with a mix of excitement and fear, for his lover was none other than Apollo, the god of the sun. Amyclas already knew that Hyacinthus and Apollo knew each other. The youths present when Hyacinthus first met Apollo spread the news far and wide, causing all sorts of rumours. Amyclas, though had believed that it would be a short affair and had continued his correspondence with King Acrisius to secure a match between Hyacinthus and Princess Danae. Apollo had found out and was not happy about it. The god asked to formally met King Amyclas in order to discourage him from betrothing Hyacinthus.\n\nAs Apollo entered the room, his radiant aura filled the space, leaving everyone in awe, including King Amyclas. Flattered by the divine presence, the king greeted Apollo with deep respect. However, beneath his cordial demeanour, Amyclas harboured concerns about his son's future.\n\nHyacinthus was his heir, destined to rule Sparta and continue the royal lineage. This duty included marrying and producing heirs, and King Amyclas had already chosen Princess Danae of Argos as a suitable match for his son. But as Apollo's gaze met his, Amyclas could see the god's displeasure.\n\nApollo, deeply unhappy about the proposed betrothal, voiced his concerns. He had no wish to share his beloved Hyacinthus with anyone. He told Amyclas,\n\"I ask you not to seek any betrothals for Hyacinthus. As for heirs, leave that to me. I will find a way for us to have children together. All I ask is for you to wait.\"\nThe room fell silent. Amyclas looked at his son, then back at Apollo. He saw the love in their eyes and understood the depth of their bond. After a moment of contemplation, he agreed to Apollo's request. He would wait and put his trust in the god's promise.\n\nAmyclas couldn't help but think of the young Princess Danae. Both she and Hyacinthus were young, and the future was unpredictable. He knew that anything could happen, and while he had given his word to Apollo, he also knew that the path of destiny was often winding and unexpected.\n\n \n\nIn the aftermath of the meeting, Apollo, still not trusting King Amyclas, decided to take matters into his own hands. He knew that Princess Danae's father, King Acrisius of Argos, was deeply superstitious. So, Apollo inspired Acrisius to visit the Oracle of Delphi to inquire about the succession of his kingdom. After all, no matter how good a son-in-law they secured, each king preferred to be succeeded by his son, not his daughter's husband.\n\nInt intrigued by the sudden inspiration, King Acrisius embarked on the journey to Delphi. There, in the sacred temple, he sought the wisdom of the Oracle. The Oracle, under Apollo's influence, revealed a prophecy that sent a chill down Acrisius' spine. He was destined to be killed by his grandson. His daughter's son would end up murdering him. When and how was not something the Oracle would tell him, but it was horrible enough. Maybe it would be an accident, murder, or maybe it would be an act of mercy when Acrisius was ailing horribly. The Oracle would not say, and the King of Argos assumed the worst.\nThe prophecy struck fear into Acrisius' heart. The thought of his bloodline leading to his demise was too much to bear. He decided then and there that he would not marry his daughter, Danae, to anyone, thus ensuring that he would have no grandson. But that let the option of Danae shaming him and conceiving a son out of wedlock; such a son would have even more reason to kill his grandfather and claim the throne.\n\nAcrisius needed to keep his daughter away from all men. When he returned to Agros, he would order the construction of a bronze chamber to lock his daughter inside. He could not kill his daughter. She was his only child, for one thing. And also, the dreaded Furies would hunt him if he were to kill his flesh and blood. But he could keep the girl locked up until she was no longer of childbearing age.\n\nBack in Sparta with his beautiful beloved prince in his arms, Apollo watched as his plan unfolded. He had successfully diverted the threat of Hyacinthus' betrothal to Danae. Now, he could focus on finding a way for him and Hyacinthus to have children together, as he had promised King Amyclas. Hyacinthus needed at least one heir, and that son would be Apollo's. Hyacinthus would marry no one else and have children with no one else. Apollo had told Clio that he would let Hyacinthus go if that was what the prince wanted, but the god knew he could not. His only choice was to keep Hyacinthus in love with him. Nothing else could be endured.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIcarus:\n\n \n\nIcarus found himself deeply enjoying Apollo's presence. When he went to the temple to pray, he had not expected this. He had hoped to get some advice on how to help Artemis with Aura. Or, Apollo could handle the problem of Aura, just like he had handled the problem of Orion. Icarus felt deeply guilty for wishing Apollo's legendary and terrifying wrath upon Aura, but it would be necessary. Aura had challenged Artemis' very domains. She needed to be punished, or Artemis might find herself in dire straights, especially if Aura kept mentioning Orion.\n\nOne time, shortly after turning eleven, Icarus needed to punch out one bard for daring to sing a rather suggestive song about Artemis and Orion. The same bard had later been found dead at the edge of a forest, a stag's horn buried deep in his belly. It had not been an easy or quick death. Artemis' answer to his prayer. But that had been a random blasphemous bard, not a companion of many centuries, a cousin of the goddess.\n\nIt was not the only time Icarus had to fight someone to defend one of the women in his life. After the Minotaur had been born, Queen Pasiphae had been in everyone's tongues, the rumours foul and vicious. No one cared that the queen had been enchanted, thus not responsible for her actions. That did not make for interesting gossip. Minos only acted when the gossip insulted him, but he let them talk about the queen however they wanted. The queen's sons followed his father's example.\n\nEven Deucalion, much to Icarus' disappointment. Before the bull fiasco, he had considered Deucalion the only decent one out of Ariadne's brothers, and it was deeply disheartening that the prince would not even defend his mother. Icarus and Ariadne were the only ones that called out the gossip. Icarus at least could challenge them to duels and beat them bloody, with the promise of worse if another word left their mouths.\n\nThe queen was a shadow of her former, radiant self. Now, she spent all her time in her rooms, leaving only to help Daedalus fortify the Labyrinth and when Minos forced her to attend the Harvest feasts when the Athenian youths arrived. The king hoped to get a reaction out of his queen, but Pasiphae was as neutral and composed as a statue, not giving him any satisfaction. Icarus would have thought her broken if it had not been for the curse she placed on the king. Every time Minos took a mistress, his seed would turn into scorpions and serpents, destroying the woman from the inside. As brutally ruthless as that was, Icarus could not condemn the queen. All wives were disposable; Pasiphae needed to secure her position and that of her children.\n\nPasiphae's sister, Circe, visited more often to remind Minos that Pasiphae was not without allies. But it was not enough; Minos' disdain for his queen and his daughters grew. He was even eyeing his sons with displeasure after Prince Androgeus had perished in Athens at the horns of the very same bull that had cuckolded Minos.\n\nWhen Heracles had come for his Seventh Labour to capture the Cretan Bull, Minos had been all too eager to dispose of the creature he had once so deeply coveted, to the point where he sought to cheat an Olympian god of his due. Heracles had hauled the bull in his ship, where his brother and nephew waited. Minos, wanting to regain some status, had thrown a lavish feast for his famous half-brother. Heracles had eaten enough food for ten men and drank enough wine for twenty men. While drunk, he bragged about all his accomplishments. Icarus' eyes had glazed overhearing the drunkard preen. Then Heracles had started wailing and complaining about wasting his best years labouring for his cousin, King Eurystheus.\n\nIcarus had then snapped and reminded the famous demigod that his service under King Eurystheus was penance for murdering his wife and his own children. Everyone had gone quiet as death as Heracles had turned red, crushing his kylix in his hands, wine splattering and shards of pottery making his hands bleed. Minos pretended to glare at Icarus and ordered him to leave. Icarus had bowed to the king, seeing the malicious glee in Minos' eyes. The king was glad to see his more renowned half-brother be taken down a peg.\n\nAriadne and Daedalus had been furious with Icarus. Both had scolded him ferociously for provoking a known madman who possessed immense strength and had the favour of Zeus to shield him from all consequences. Ariadne had brought a loom into Daedalus' house and once again forced Icarus to weave as punishment. Surprisingly, Daedalus had agreed with her, hoping that the tedious task would teach Icarus some patience and restraint. Yes, Heracles was a kinslayer and a drunkard, but provoking him was folly. Hopefully Hera and Eurystheus would dispose of him soon. That son of Zeus was not Crete's problem.\nEveryone had been relieved to see Heracles go, white bull in tow. Unfortunately, it was not the end of the bull's tale. The beast had escaped and ended up in the Marathon, causing quite a bit of destruction with no one stopping it. When Androgeous won all of the Athenian games and gained great renown, King Aegeus had the idea of sending the Cretan prince after the bull. Androgeus had jumped at the chance to slaughter the creature that had ruined his family's reputation but had failed and died. Minos, when he heard, was furious. Androgeus was his favourite son and chosen heir. Losing him was a terrible blow. He had gathered his navy and laid siege upon Athens. The city held out until Minos prayed to his father Zeus to strike the city with plague. King Aegeus had been forced to capitulate to Minos' demands.\n\nAegeus had no children for Minos to kill. So, the Cretan king decided to kill the children of the high-born Athenians. Every year, seven youths and seven maidens from good families had to come to Crete and be fed to the Minotaur. When the unfortunate Athenians arrived, Minos rubbed salt into the wound by throwing a feast. The youths and maidens were put on a dias for everyone to gawk at as high-born Cretans feasted under Minos' eagle eye.\n\nAt first, Icarus and Ariadne avoided the gruesome feasts, but Minos noted their absence and ensured that both of them would be there. The two friends sat in the feasting hall, silent and pale, unable to eat a bite. They did drink wine to dull the horror. Ariadne had the good luck to be a lightweight. One cup, and she was out like a light. Icarus was not so lucky. He could handle wine fairly well, his stomach getting uncomfortably full, and his mind barely addled, slightly dulling the horror of the Harvest Feast. He got sick the day after, suffering horribly from headaches and nausea, which made him loathe Dionysus' invention.\nApollo smiled when Icarus told him how much he loathed wine and what it did to him.\n\n\"Have you ever angered Dionysus?\"\n\nIcarus had to pause and think.\n\n\"I don't think so. Our household is careful to attend all festivals and sacrifice on all sacred days. We have never scorned any gods. Father is quite prudent about that ever since his mother killed my mother.\"\n\nApollo brushed Icarus' curls away from his forehead.\n\n\"Dionysus can be ornery. He thinks that all youths should follow his example, partying and drinking heavily every night. Not formal feasts like the ones you attend at Minos' palace, but wild revels in the woods, with meanads.\"\n\nIcarus' face must have shown the horror he felt at such activities because the god laughed, the sound enchanting and musical, making Icarus wish he could hear it for the rest of his life.\n\n\"I see that is not to your liking. You lead a very clean life and Dionysus would not like that.\"\n\n\"Nothing I can do about that, Artemis is my patron goddess. I can hardly shame her by behaving in that way! Not that I would want to!\"\n\nThe god's smile fell.\n\n\"Have you sworn any vows to my sister?\" He asked.\n\nIcarus wracked his mind. Artemis had never asked that he pledge his chastity to her. All she had asked of him was to respect her vows, that of her maidens and to treat women with respect. He told Apollo so, and the god smiled once again. Icarus blushed as he guessed the sun god wanted to know such a thing.\n\n\"Apollo,\"\n\nIcarus began, his voice wavering, \"\n\nI value our friendship, but I fear what it might become. I am close to Artemis, and I do not wish to betray that bond.\"\n\nApollo, ever the embodiment of warmth and understanding, smiled at Icarus.\n\n\"Fear not, Icarus,\" he reassured, \"You have sworn no vows of chastity to Artemis. Your heart is your own to give.\"\n\nIcarus pondered Apollo's words, his mind drifting back to the times Artemis and her companion, Polyboea, had teased him about marrying Ariadne, his closest friend. Icarus had protested, telling them that he saw Ariadne as a sister. He realized then that Artemis did not expect him to remain untouched by love. She only expected him to respect their vows and women in general.\n\nWith this realization, Icarus felt a weight lift from his shoulders. He looked at Apollo, the god he feared might be his downfall, now a beacon of his newfound understanding. Their bond, he realized, was not one of betrayal but of growth and acceptance. But Icarus would need to talk to Artemis first to ensure no misunderstandings. Artemis saved his life as a small child and taught him archery, hunting, and woodcraft. Icarus would not betray her trust.\n\n \n\nApollo escorted Icarus back into his home and watched the boy fall asleep. He looked around the room. Daedalus spared no expense in making his son comfortable. Icarus' rooms were not as large and luxurious as the ones he had as Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta, but they were good enough, considering Apollo's beloved was not an heir to a kingdom then. A kingdom that their son should have inherited, but Zeus had decided otherwise. The king of the gods had said it would be too disruptive and difficult for the mortals to understand.\n\nApollo had seethed and watched as Hyacinthus' half-brothers bumbled their way to kingship, steal the throne that belonged to Asclepius. He had ensured that those two embittered fools paid proper respect to his beloved's memory and that they did not cause the fall of Sparta. Hyacinthus had loved his kingdom dearly. At least Oebalus, his beloved's nephew had been a decent sort. He worshiped his famed uncle and even named a son Hyacinthus. The glorious festival of Hyacinthia became even more lavish and profound under Oebalus' reign. For that alone, Apollo blessed the Spartan king. Oebalus lived long and reigned wisely.\n\nApollo felt his sister approach. So, she was done with Aura. He had observed the punishment when Icarus was asleep. Artemis now knew that Apollo knew. The golden god felt a sharp sting of betrayal. Artemis knew now much Apollo longed for Hyacinthus, how much his death still hurt, and yet she did this. She knew that the love of Apollo's life was reborn but told him nothing for eleven years. Had Icarus not gone to his temple to pray, she might have never told him. Icarus could have gone through life, never meeting Apollo. The very idea of that hurt almost as much as cradling a bleeding and dying Hyacinthus had.\n\n\"Apollo, you must understand,\"\n\nArtemis pleaded, her voice echoing through Icarus' bedroom, forcing Apollo to spell his beloved into a deep sleep so he would not wake.,\"When I found Icarus, he was but a child of four years. It was not the time for him to meet a former lover.\"\n\nApollo turned to face his sister, his golden eyes ablaze with betrayal.\n\n\"You knew, Artemis,\" he accused, his voice a low growl, \"You knew that Hyacinthus, my beloved, had been reborn as Icarus. Yet, you chose to hide it from me.\"\nArtemis met her brother's gaze steadily.\n\n\"Yes, I knew,\" she admitted, \"But I did it to protect him, Apollo. He was too young, too innocent. He needed to grow, to live his life without the weight of a past he could not remember.\"\n\nApollo's anger waned, replaced by a profound sadness.\n\n\"Hyacinthus was the love of my life, Artemis,\" he confessed, his voice barely a whisper, \"And you kept him from me.\"\n\nArtemis reached out, placing a comforting hand on her brother's shoulder.\n\n\"I did not keep him from you, Apollo,\" she said softly, \"I merely gave him the chance to grow, to become his own person before he met you. I did it for him... and for you.\"\n\nArtemis continued.\n\n\"As I helped raise him, Icarus came to view me as a mother. Had you been present in his life at such a young age, he could have come to view you as a parental figure. You would not have liked that, the love of your life feeling a completely different type of love for you. One incompatible with what you feel for him.\"\n\nAs the truth of Artemis' words sank in, Apollo found himself grappling with a whirlwind of emotions. Betrayal, anger, sadness... and finally, understanding. He realized then that Artemis, in her own way, had been looking out for both him and Icarus.\n\n\"Also,\" Artemis spoke again, glaring at her brother.\n\n\"Don't you know that your little dalliance with Princess Ariadne's eldest sister bore fruit?\"\n\nApollo reluctantly tore his eyes from the sleeping Icarus to frown at his sister.\n\n\"Princess Ariadne's sister?\" He tilted his head, not quite sure what his sister meant.\n\n\"Acacallis.\" Artemis hissed.\n\n\"The nymph in Carmanor's household? That was centuries ago!\"\n\nArtemis' jaw dropped.\n\n\"Ariadne's sister is also named Acacallis! Hermes told me about it. I thought you had gone back to the nymph but then I discovered you with Icarus!\"\n\nApollo finally realized whom Artemis meant.\n\n\"Ah! Minos' daughter!\"\n\nArtemis' hand twitched, itching to slap her twin.\n\n\"Anyway, she is very unhappy that you bedded her for a few night, forgot about her and are now doting on Icarus blatantly and publicly.\"\n\nApollo scowled at the hint that Acacallis might mean Icarus harm, and Artemis scoffed.\n\n\"I already threatened the girl. No need for you to stick your nose in it and make her even more jealous.\"\n\nApollo turned to gaze at Icarus with a fond smile, causing Artemis to seize his arm and turn him around to face her.\n\n\"She is pregnant with your child! Icarus might find out and he will not be happy.\"\nApollo scoffed.\n\n\"This happened before I met him. I will not dally with anyone else, just like I did when Hyacinthus was alive.\"\n\nArtemis sighed.\n\n\"There is no reasoning with you. At least it was not Ariadne. Icarus would have never forgiven you for that.\"\nApollo merely nodded, distracted by the words that Icarus was mumbling in his sleep. Something about melting wax and burning wings. What was his beloved dreaming about?\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nModern times:\nApollo, the god of sun, music, and prophecy, was tormented by a love lost not once, but twice. It had been more than three thousand long years, but his heart ached for Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta, a mortal who had captured his divine heart once and forever. Hyacinthus, however, met a tragic end, and was reborn as Icarus, only to be claimed by death once more. In his grief, Apollo transformed Icarus's lifeless body into a tree, a silent testament to his enduring love. Apollo housed the tree in his sacred island of Delos, safe from everyone and everything. He visited the tree regularly and so did his sister Artemis. For Artemis had been the one to help raise Icarus and had come to care for him as dearly as one of her maiden companions.\n\nApollo, however, was not without allies. Persephone, the queen of the underworld, owed him a favor. In her power, she created a mystical connection between the Icarus tree and the soul of Hyacinthus in the underworld. When Hyacinthus was reborn for the third time, his demigod essence was drawn into the tree, creating a bond between the mortal realm and the divine. At first Apollo was overjoyed, the love of his life was alive once more. But unfortunately Hyacinthus was harder than ever to find. The modern world was overpopulated, every part of the earth inhabited. Hyacinthus could be everywhere, and as a demigod once more was vulnerable to dying young.\n\nApollo, in his desperation, searched for his lost love in every newborn boy, but to no avail. Hyacinthus remained elusive, his essence hidden within the Icarus tree. In a final attempt, Apollo infused the tree with his godly essence, hoping to gain a vision of Hyacinthus's whereabouts.\nBut the gods work in mysterious ways. Instead of revealing Hyacinthus, the tree absorbed Apollo's godly essence. The demigod essence of Hyacinthus and the godly essence of Apollo intertwined, giving birth to a new life. From the Icarus tree, a demigod child was born, a symbol of their undying love. He was named William Alexios Solace.\n\nWilliam was no ordinary child. He was born of a tree, nurtured by the essence of a demigod and a god. He was a beacon of hope for Apollo, a promise that love endures, transcending death and rebirth. And though Apollo's heart still yearned for Hyacinthus, he found solace in William, a living testament to his love story that defied the heavens themselves. The baby was nearly identical to Apollo, having the same golden curls, the same fine features. The main difference were the eyes, a beautiful bright, emerald green, strangely familiar. Also the boy's smile. The very same smile that Hyacinthus and Icarus had. The same smile that Asclepius had.\n\nIn defiance of ancient laws, Apollo decided to keep his son, William Alexios Solace, with him. He raised William in the sacred island of Delos, with the help of his mother, Leto, and her nymph attendants. For three years, they lived in harmony, the island echoing with the laughter of the young demigod. Apollo delighted in looking after his adorable little bundle of sunshine when he was not looking for Hyacinthus or attending his many duties. Never before had he been grateful for the god's ability to split their conciousness so they could be in multiple places at once.\n\nAs William grew, so did his curiosity about the world beyond Delos. Unable to deny his son's wishes, Apollo took him to the mortal world, hoping to give him a taste of a regular life. However, their journey did not go unnoticed. Apollo was spotted and reported to Zeus, the king of the gods.\n\nZeus, known for his strict adherence to divine laws, was angered by Apollo's actions. He demanded that Apollo take William to Camp Halfblood, a safe haven for demigods, if there was no mortal parent to raise him. Apollo tried to explain that the mortal parent was the third incarnation of Hyacinthus, but Zeus would not hear of it. The king of the gods wanted his laws obeyed, with no question or exception.\n\nFear gripped Apollo's heart as he remembered the fate of Asclepius, another demigod son of his whom Zeus had struck down. With a heavy heart and deep regret, Apollo made the painful decision to give up his son. He entrusted William to Chiron, the wise centaur who ran Camp Halfblood, hoping that he would find a home among other demigods.\n\nAnd so, William Alexios Solace, born of a tree and the love between a god and a mortal, began a new chapter of his life at Camp Halfblood, carrying with him the legacy of Apollo and Hyacinthus. It was no easy feat. Little Will was too used to having his father around and did not take the absence lightly. He screamed and wept for his father.\n\nChiron was informed that Hyacinthus had been reborn for a third time and that Will was his son. He remembered the massive damage that Apollo had caused the last two times Hyacinthus died. The world had been wrecked in godly rage, and Chiron feared that history would repeat itself. There was a lot more world to wreck in the modern times than it was in ancient times. The Black Death and the Spanish Flu were grim reminders of how destructive Apollo could be.\nChiron was also wary of developing an attachment to the little demigod. He remembered the pain of losing so many demigods in the past and was afraid of the same fate befalling Will. So, he decided to have Will's 8-year half-brother, Michael, a year-rounder at Camp Halfblood, look after the 3-year-old. After realizing that Daddy was not returning, Will was much calmer, cheerful and more straightforward to look after.\n\nOn the other hand, Apollo was able to secure the right to visit William a few times a year, for a day every three months. It was a small consolation, but it was better than nothing. He would get to see his son grow, even if it were from a distance.\n\nTired of having the world wrecked by Apollo's grief and rage, Zeus agreed to this arrangement. He, too, had grown weary of the destruction and chaos that followed each of Hyacinthus's deaths. In ancient times, Zeus and Hera did not allow Apollo to make Hyacinthus immortal because of fear that Apollo might fall out of love. The argument between Apollo and Zeus was reported by Olympus Weekly, causing a stir among the gods.\n\nApollo pointed out the inconsistencies in Zeus's decisions. Ganymede had been made a god despite having no accomplishments, and Zeus was far more fickle than Apollo. Psyche was made a goddess when Aphrodite and Apollo strongly objected to her deification. While Psyche had undergone trials, she had done so with Demeter and Hera's help and failed her last trial. Ariadne, at least, had earned her godhood and had been the best friend of Icarus, Hyacinthus' second incarnation.\n\nDespite the compelling argument, Zeus remained unmoved. He was tired of having the world wrecked by Apollo's grief and rage. He feared that if the third incarnation were made immortal and Apollo fell out of love, the world would once again be subjected to Apollo's wrath. Enraged, Apollo told his father that he had never fallen out of love for the past three thousand years, and as the god of prophecy, he knew that he would love Hyacinthus forever. Zeus was objecting out of spite because Apollo had the chance to be truly happy with someone he loved.\n\nHyacinthus: Caught in bed with my lover by my momClio: Apollo you thot! Why my baby!Amyclas: Hyacinthus needs heirs.Apollo: I will figure out how to give him heirs.Also Apollo: Snitches on what Danae's son is destined to do\n\nSmilax is an unsung hero.\n\nIcarus joins CPS - Ancient Greece version\n\nLuke arrives at camp.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nSmilax was born to the goddess of love and beauty. Her mother, the enchanting Aphrodite, took lovers often, and those dalliances bore fruit more times than not. Smilax was handed to her mortal father shortly after her mother had birthed her. Thankfully, her father was wealthy and thus able to hire a wetnurse so Smilax could survive infancy. She grew, becoming more beautiful each day. While disappointed not to get a demigod son, her father was happy at Smilax's beauty. He hoped to marry her above his station. The king of Sparta, the handsome warrior Amyclas, had four sons. Three by his wife, the queen Diomede and one by an immortal goddess, the Muse Clio.\n\n \n\nSmilax's father oversaw the four princes. Noting which one was most likely to become heir. Hyacinthus was the jewel of Amyclas' bloodline. The other three princes could not keep up with him despite the older two being much older and having quite the headstart on the little prince. Smilax's father smiled winsomely at the little prince, flattering him in each encounter. Smilax could see that Hyacinthus regarded her father with polite, bored disinterest, but her father was delusional. He believed that he had the regard of the favoured prince and future king.\n\n \n\nNear their mansion, another demigod lived. This one is without high status. His name was Crocus, and Smilax became friends with him. They would meet by a low hedge where their properties met and talk about everything in under the sun. Smilax grew fonder and fonder of Crocus as the years went on. But her father did not see him as a suitable suitor. Crocus was despised by his mortal grandfather despite being the son of Poseidon, one of the three most powerful gods. There was no guarantee that Crocus would even inherit, and due to his grandfather hiding him out of shame, the boy had no chance to gain renown in Sparta. He was invited to Chiron's camp at the request of his divine father. The grandfather had no choice then.\n\n \n\nSmilax saw Crocus in secret. Her father did everything to throw her in Prince Hyacinthus' path. Smilax had been wary of being near the prince at first. They were getting that age, and royal princes could be awful. She feared for her safety and dignity if her father persisted in his foolish scheme.\n\n \n\nShe was pleasantly surprised. Hyacinthus did not stare at her like everyone did, he did not stammer and blush. He regarded her just like he did everyone else. If anything about Smilax caught his interest, it was her wit and dry humour. But Smilax sensed no attraction from him, not ever. He came to regard her with fondness after repeated encounters at feasts and festivals, but it was similar to his fondness for his little sister, Princess Polyboea. Certainly now what her father hoped. It filled Smilax with glee, to sense how her father's ambitions failed.\n\n \n\nThe prince was one year younger than her and Crocus, so he was invited to camp after them. He invited her to come with him in his divine mother's chariot. Smilax's smile was fixed. She tested him by asking if Crocus could go too, and Hyacinthus immediately accepted.\n\n \n\nMeeting the goddess Clio was a shock and a delight. The muse was beautiful, an older female version of her famously gorgeous son. She was very charming and kind to the two demigods. She even praised Poseidon for having sided with her to keep her from being separated from Hyacinthus when he was a baby. Crocus smiled proudly. He rarely heard of his father being kind, only of Poseidon's wrath and power. It was a pleasant reprieve for once.\n\n \n\nWhile glad that Hyacinthus had such a close relationship with his divine mother, Smilax could not help but feel a bit jealous. She had never met her mother. Aphrodite had claimed her when she arrived in camp, but Smilax had never seen or spoken to her mother. She shook these feelings quickly. It was not Hyacinthus's fault that his mother was a loving and attentive parent. Aphrodite had many children, but Clio only had one.\n\n \n\nThe camp was unpleasant for a beautiful girl. The sons of Zeus and Ares believed themselves entitled to the beautiful bodies of Aphrodite's daughters. Smilax barely managed to keep herself unscathed in the first year. She had a plan for the second year. She would use her charmspeak and manipulative skills to send those animals after Medusa. A relative of her father had gone to Delphi and asked when Medusa would be vanquished.\n\n \n\nThe petrifying gorgon had long been a problem. Most of the time, she would stay put in a lair, only killing people who wandered by mistake or who were on a mission to slay her. But ever so often, she would change lairs, and in her path, she would petrify entire villages, towns and, in one horrifying case, an entire city. All everyone could do was bury the statues, hoping that it was enough for the victims to get to Hades.\n\n \n\nHer father's cousin had lost two sons during Medusa's latest move. Grieving and angry, he had gone to the Pythia for answers. There, he had been told that Medusa would be vanquished twice, first, by a son of Zeus with Spartan blood. She would rise again to torment the world and, this time, be vanquished for good by the sun's third beloved.\n\n \n\nThe cousin had hastened to Sparta, invading Smilax's home to search for that fabled son of Zeus with Spartan blood. He had been deeply disappointed that no such son existed. While he wailed at the unfairness, Smilax had reminded him that Sparta was close to Argos, and Hera was vigilant. Still, a Spartan-blooded son of Zeus could be born sometime soon. The cousin had decided to purchase property and settle in Sparta, awaiting the birth of the demigod that would avenge his slain sons.\n\n \n\nSmilax had gotten her revenge on the campers who had wronged her and on Chiron, who turned a blind eye. Keeping sweet, innocent and gloriously beautiful Hyacinthus safe in that lair of vicious beasts was a job and a half, but she was glad to do so, and Crocus was happy to assist her. When they returned to Sparta, their friendship was strong, and she hoped they would finally be happy. Smilax had everything she wanted: betrothed to the man she loved and a good friend in the future king. The future was looking bright, and she allowed herself to relax and look forward to the rest of her life.\n\n \n\nOf course, her mother was not content to just let her be. In the realm of the gods, where love and power intertwine, Aphrodite was not content with what her daughter had achieved for herself. Aphrodite did not care that Smilax was betrothed to Crocus, the son of Poseidon, and their love was as deep as the ocean his father ruled. Their bond was strengthened by their mutual friendship with Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta, the son of King Amyclas and the Muse of History, Clio. She yearned for her daughter's love story to be a grand saga that would echo through the ages, not a simple sweet tale soon forgotten.\n\n \n\nIn the hallowed temple, Aphrodite revealed her plan to Smilax. She was to seduce Prince Hyacinthus and make him fall madly in love with her, inciting a quarrel between Crocus and Hyacinthus. Smilax was horrified. The thought of betraying Crocus, the man she loved, and Hyacinthus, her closest friend, was unbearable. Yet, Aphrodite was resolute, her divine will unyielding. Faced with her mother's wrath, Smilax feigned agreement, but within her heart, she resolved to find a way out of this cruel game.\n\n \n\nSmilax was caught in a web of deception and fear as the days passed. Every smile and every word Hyacinthus exchanged felt like a betrayal to Crocus. Yet, she had to maintain the facade, for her mother's watchful eyes were always upon her. Thankfully, Hyacinthus was immune to feminine wiles, even those of Love's Daughters. Aphrodite did not understand and thought Smilax was complying, not noticing the visible anxiety and fear. Crocus and Hyacinthus noticed and asked her questions that Smilax could not answer. One time, when she could not feel her mother's eyes, she gave them a cryptic clue. She would do anything to protect them. Even die.\n\n \n\nSmilax prayed to the gods for guidance in the quiet of the night. She knew she had to reveal the truth to Crocus and Hyacinthus but feared the consequences. Her mother would be furious and might take matters in her cruel, callous hands. Would they believe her? Would they forgive her? Smilax did not know. She was on her own and needed to find a way out. She would not be used as the weapon of destruction for the two people she loved the most.\n\n \n\nAs Smilax grappled with her predicament, she realized the only way to protect Crocus and Hyacinthus from Aphrodite's schemes was for her to die. But her death had to be such that it wouldn't arouse Aphrodite's suspicion. If she were to take her own life, Aphrodite could still torment Crocus and Hyacinthus. Smilax needed to provoke someone into murdering her. No mortal would dare to murder her, for she was the betrothed of a powerful demigod and under the protection of the Crown Prince of Sparta. It had to be a god. Only a god would dare.\n\n \n\nShe considered provoking Ares, the god of war at first. Ares was known for his volatile temper, and Smilax loathed his daughter Aristodamia and her intentions toward Hyacinthus. But she soon reconsidered. Aristodamia had been caught committing adultery in Hera's temple, profaning it and enraging the queen of the gods. Ares had been deeply unhappy with his mother and could not believe his daughter had done such a thing. If Smilax provoked him, Ares might see a connection between the powers that Children and Aphrodite usually had and Aristodamia's utter stupidity. Smilax had not used her powers on Aristodamia since she was queen, and Smilax was a loyal citizen of Sparta, but Ares would not believe that and might turn his wrath on Sparta. As a Spartan lady, Smilax could not take that risk. She discarded Ares as an option. Her death needed to cause as little collateral damage as possible. Ares was too volatile and unpredictable. He would not care for collateral damage, but relish it.\n\n \n\nOne day, as she accompanied Crocus for his household libations to various temples, she sensed a deep passion for Crocus emanating from the statue of Hermes in his main Spartan temple. Smilax almost could not believe her senses and decided to be sure. She used a few items that her sisters had given her to disguise herself as a boy so she could follow Crocus around. If Hermes had feelings for her betrothed, the god would approach him in disguise. It was what gods did; if they liked something, they could not keep their hands off it. That went double for the god of thievery. She simmered with bitter jealousy but this was her best chance.\n\n \n\nShe approached the disguised Hermes, acting like a jealous woman, which was not much of an act. Smilax was jealous, accusing the god of coveting what did not belong to him. She bragged that she was the one that Crocus loved and that Crocus, being a deeply loyal and honourable Spartan nobleman, would never betray her for a lying thief, even if that thief was a god. Hermes infuriated, struck Smilax dead in a fit of anger. Then he realized that he had killed the betrothed of Crocus. If Crocus finds out, he will never agree to be with Hermes.\n\n \n\nIn his desperation, Hermes transformed Smilax's corpse into a shrub and manipulated people's memories to make them believe that Smilax had quarrelled with her mother, the goddess Aphrodite, and in anger, Aphrodite had killed and transformed her daughter.\n\n \n\nThe news of Smilax's death sent shockwaves through the realm. Crocus and Hyacinthus mourned their beloved friend, their hearts filled with sorrow. Aphrodite, too, was filled with grief, her grand plan having resulted in the death of her own daughter. She denied that it was her but no one believed her. Not even Ares, her lover or Aphrodite's other children. Aphrodite was well known for being cruel and capricious. The goddess stopped defending herself and decided to observe until she could discover who had defied her by murdering her daughter and blaming it on her.\n\n \n\nUltimately, Smilax's love story silently became a grand saga, not of a messy love triangle as Aphrodite had planned, but of a noble sacrifice of a young girl who stood firm to her principles. Her story should have echoed through the ages, a testament to the lengths one would go to protect those they love. But good, loyal, and self sacrificing women are rarely remembered. Only harlots, harpies and harridans get their name etched in history. Mortals recalled Smilax as a beautiful nymph, who was in love with Crocus, a youth from Lacedaemonia and both of them had a love affair that ended unhappily with both of them being transfomed into plants. Crocus had a bit more fame, as a lover of a god and that overshadowed everything else.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~\nIn the wake of Smilax's tragic death, Crocus, son of Poseidon, was enveloped in a shroud of grief. A grief shared by his best friend, the Crown Prince of Sparta, Hyacinthus. Hyacinthus, while devastated by the death of one of his most cherished friends, had a godly lover to console and distract him.\n\n \n\nCrocus had no one but Hyacinthus to share the grief with, and his heart ached for his lost love, and his world seemed devoid of color. It was during this time of sorrow that Hermes, the messenger god, began to appear to the Spartan nobleman.\n\n \n\nHermes had always admired Crocus from afar, captivated by his strength and nobility. But now, seeing Crocus in such pain, Hermes felt a surge of compassion and a desire to comfort the grieving demigod despite having caused it. Never once letting it show that Hermes himself was the source of Crocus' pain and sorrow. Gods are complex, Hermes perhaps expecially so.\n\n \n\nOne day, Hermes appeared before Crocus, not in his divine form, but as a simple traveler. He offered words of consolation, shared stories to distract Crocus from his grief, and slowly, he began to see a change. Once dull with sorrow, Crocus' eyes started to regain their spark. His rare laughter began to echo in the halls once more.\n\n \n\nHermes fell deeper in love with Crocus, the former infatuation deepening into genuine love. He admired Crocus' resilience and his ability to find joy in the smallest things, even amid his grief. But he also understood that Crocus was still healing, that he needed time to mourn the loss of his beloved Smilax.\n\n \n\nSo, Hermes made a decision. He would wait. He would give Crocus the time he needed to heal, to grieve. He would not rush him into another relationship. Instead, he would be there as a friend, a companion to share in Crocus' sorrow and joy.\n\n \n\nDays turned into weeks and weeks into months. Hermes stayed by Crocus' side, their bond deepening with each passing day. They trained together, shared meals, and talked late into the night. Their friendship became a source of comfort for Crocus, a beacon of light guiding him out of his grief. If only Crocus knew. Hermes felt regret for causing Crocus such pain, but he would never regret the relationship that he was forming with Crocus. He was a god, and gods are deeply selfish creatures. By killing Smilax, Hermes had a good chance to get his beloved Crocus as his lover. He soothed himself that Smilax had insulted and belittled him. Every god responded with divine wrath at such a thing. Never did the god of deceit and trickery suspect that a mere slip of a demigod girl could have deceived and tricked him.\n\n \n\nAnd so, they waited. Hermes, for the day when Crocus would be ready to love again, and Crocus, for the day when his heart would heal. In the meantime, they found solace in their friendship and shared the understanding that sometimes, love meant waiting patiently in the wings, giving the other the space and time they needed to heal. And in that waiting, they found a deep, understanding, and true love. A love that, while different from what they had known, was just as beautiful and profound. Alas, such a love whose foundation was rooted in Hermes' deception. Apollo, brother to Hermes and god of truth, saw through the deceit but decided to keep silent. Revealing the truth would only provoke Aphrodite, putting Hyacinthus and Crocus in danger.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIcarus:\nIn the grand halls of Crete, Princess Acacallis, daughter of King Minos, harboured a secret. She was with child, a divine offspring of the radiant Apollo. Fearful of her father's wrath, she masked her pregnancy with a guise of illness, her once vibrant eyes now dulled with feigned suffering. Her father was cold and distant at the best of times. He would not check on her and risk catching an illness himself. Her maidservants would not dare betray the princess. If Minos found out, he would not just punish Acacallis for dishonouring the royal family; he would punish the princess' staff for failing to prevent her disgrace. So, the maidservants kept the secret despite misgivings.\n\n \n\nApollo, the father of her unborn child, was of no help. Their passionate affair had been brief, a fleeting moment under the celestial canopy. Apollo's attention had shifted to Icarus, the son of the ingenious inventor Daedalus. The god's affection for Icarus was a bitter pill for Acacallis to swallow. Apollo had visited Acacallis for a few nights. During those brief times, Acacallis was so proud and pleased with herself. Since her mother's disgrace with the bull, no man of proper status had wanted to court her. No king, prince or noble lord wanted to risk being cuckolded by an animal like Minos had been. Acacallis' beauty did not stir their hearts into ignoring the foul gossip and asking for her hand anyway.\n\n \n\nWhen Apollo visited, Acacallis was hopeful that the radiant god of music, song, and poetry would proudly announce their affair, making Acacallis a prize. No such thing had happened. No such thing happened. Apollo caught sight of the inventor's son and never visited her again no matter how much Acacallis prayed as her belly swelled. She ordered her maidservants to watch Icarus and listened glumly to their reports. Apollo and the boy were on everyone's tongues, all Cretans talking about how the sun god was besotted. Apollo spent days and nights with Icarus sang songs about him. Ordered his priests to show him every possible honour.\n\n \n\nEach news was another blow to Acacallis. Acacallis and Icarus had a history of animosity. Icarus, a close friend of Acacallis' sister Ariadne, had always disapproved of Acacallis' cruel treatment of her sister and her staff. A particular incident had cemented his disdain for the princess. When a necklace had gone missing, Acacallis had ordered her maidservants beaten until they confessed. The necklace was later found under a rug, but the damage had been done. Icarus viewed Acacallis as vicious and cruel ever since. The self-righteous little brat had always despised her for being unkind to Ariadne. As an only child, Icarus did not understand what it was like to have younger siblings who stole affection from their parents and got the presents she wanted.\n\n \n\nIn her heart, a desire for revenge took root. She contemplated harming Icarus, but the goddess Artemis, protector of Icarus, issued a divine warning. Artemis' wrath was not something Acacallis could risk, so she swallowed her resentment. She watched with eyes full of hate as Icarus enjoyed Apollo's love and favour. The boy glowed with happiness, making him even more beautiful.\n\n \n\nIn the secrecy of her chambers, Acacallis gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, his eyes as bright as his father's. But the bitterness in her heart overpowered her maternal instincts. She ordered her maidservant to expose the child, a cruel act that mirrored her sense of abandonment. She told herself that she could not keep the child. She had no proof that the baby's father was a god. Minos would assume the worst and punish her severely. Acacallis needed to think of herself and her future.\n\n \n\nHowever, Acacallis was not one to wallow in despair. She set her sights on another god, Hermes, the messenger of the gods known for his charm and wit. She hoped to catch his attention, soothe her injured pride and perhaps find a semblance of happiness amidst her trials. Icarus was not the only one beautiful and charming enough to turn a god's heart. On her last visit to Hermes' temple,, she noticed the statue's eyes following her. She would visit when she recovered from childbirth, dressed in her best chiton and wearing her finest jewels.\n\n \n\nHowever, one of Acacallis' maidservants, the one charged with following Icarus as he was romanced by the sun god, decided to defy her mistress. She was terrified of divine wrath for being party to the exposure of a demigod infant. And she was also horrified at the idea of disposing of a perfectly healthy and beautiful baby. She was practical and knew that she could do nothing for the infant herself. Even if she could find where her fellow maidservant abandoned the baby, she had no hope against the wild animals in the forests. She also had nowhere to take the baby. She could not claim the baby as hers. People had seen her around and knew that she had not been pregnant. Also, maidservants could not dally with men without leave from the king or queen.\n\n \n\nShe knew Icarus was an avid hunter, familiar with the woods around Knossos. He was kindhearted and would not let a child die. Secretly, she went to Daedalus' house and asked to speak to Icarus. At first, she was met with disbelief. She was just a maidservant. How could she show up in the household of one of the most important men in Crete and demand to speak to his only son in the middle of the night? Everyone's beloved young master? The chief maidservant of Daedalus as about to send her away when the young man in question arrived and asked his servant to let her in. Grateful she followed inside.\n\n \n\nDaedalus' mansion was a sight to behold. The receiving room, where Icarus received her, was adorned with red walls, fine tapestries, and finely carved wooden benches lined with plush cushions and animal pelts. The room's grandeur momentarily dazzled the maidservant before she recalled her mission. Hearing her tale, Icarus was horrified, grabbed his weapons, and ran to find the baby.\n\n \n\nThe moon was high in the sky when a loud, desperate knock echoed through the quiet halls of Icarus' home. Startled, Icarus rose from his bed and cautiously approached the entrance of his father's house. He heard Eumede, their housekeeper, argue with someone loudly. Curious he walked toward the noise and with Eumede he found one of Princess Acacallis' maidservants, her face pale and eyes wide with fear.\n\n \n\n\"Master Icarus,\" she began, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I bring grave news from the palace.\"\n\n \n\nSensing her distress, Icarus invited her in, ignoring Eumede's frown of displeasure as the housekeeper kept after them, gesturing for her to follow him into the receiving room.\n\n \n\n\"What troubles you at this late hour?\" he asked, concern etching his features.\n\n \n\nThe maidservant took a deep breath, steadying herself before she spoke.\n\n \n\n\"Princess Acacallis... she has given birth to a son, fathered by Apollo.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus' eyes widened in surprise and a bit of hurt. He told himself not to be ridiculous. Apollo had already told him that he had an affair with a local woman before meeting him but it was over. The god had promised to be loyal to Icarus.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo's child? But why are you here?\"\n\n \n\nThe maidservant wrung her hands nervously.\n\n \n\n\"The princess... she was angered. Apollo forgot her after a few secret nights but has been openly romancing you for months. In her anger, she ordered the child to be exposed in the woods.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus felt a chill run down his spine. He was familiar with how cruel Acacallis could be. But could not believe that she would do this to her own child. He had consoled Ariadne as she sobbed after her sister bullied her viciously. He had seen the state of those poor girls after Acacallis unfairly accused them of stealing her necklace. At least he had been able to appeal to Queen Pasiphae, so the Acacallis victims were moved to the service of Ariadne and Xenodice. Both were kind and gentle princesses.\n\n \n\n\"Exposed? But that means...\"\n\n \n\n\"Yes,\" the maidservant interrupted, her voice trembling.\n\n \n\n\"The child could be devoured by wild animals, bringing the divine wrath of his godly father upon us all! I cannot look for him myself, but you... you are familiar with the woods. You can fight off the animals.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus was horrified. He could hardly believe what he was hearing. A child, an innocent life, was in danger because of a lover's spat. He couldn't let that happen.\n\n \n\nWithout a second thought, Icarus grabbed his weapons.\n\n \n\n\"Stay here,\" he ordered the maidservant. Acacallis would notice her absence and not be happy about it. The princess had no issue with ordering helpless women to be beaten to death. Besides, Pasiphae had been hinting at him what he wanted for his upcoming sixteenth birthday. He would ask for this brave maidservant.\n\n \n\n\"I will find the child.\" He told her, and the woman slumped in relief.\n\n \n\nAnd with that, he dashed into the night, determined to save the innocent life that had been so cruelly abandoned. He would never let a child die, and certainly not a child of his lover.\n\n \n\nIcarus grabbed his weapons and dashed towards the woods without a second thought. His heart pounding, he calculated the quickest route from Minos' palace to the woods of Knossos. As he neared the spot, he heard the distant growls of wolves. With a surge of adrenaline, he fought off the pack, his eyes finally landing on the tiny, helpless infant. The baby was laying on a mound of red earth close to a largethicket of smilax shrubs, the red berries glistening in the bright moonlight. Swallowing bile as he recalled that tragic tale, Icarus acted fast. A demigod girl or nymph who was murdered by her mother. He could not let it repeat.\n\n \n\nCradling the child in his arms, Icarus returned home while praying thanks to Artemis for his tracking and hunting skills. He ordered his servants to bring goat's milk, adding a drop of nectar to soothe the crying infant. But looking down at the innocent face, he knew he couldn't keep the child. Acacallis could harm him again, and Minos would surely kill him if he found out.\n\n \n\n\"I must protect him,\" Icarus decided, \"I will entrust him to the family that guards my father's herds. They are kind and one couple is childless. They will raise him as their own. They are pious and will shelter and love him dearly when they know he is a demigod.\"\n\n \n\nHe decided to name the boy Miletus, a name with double meanings: red earth, for where he had found the baby, and the root word of solder. The sad truth was that every demigod must be a soldier. It was the only way they would survive this cruel world, trapped between humanity and divinity.\n\n \n\nThe kind cattle herders were happy to receive the baby demigod. Icarus left them a few vials of nectar. He instructed them to add one single drop to each large jar of goat milk. They were not to try and sample it themselves; it would burn them from the inside out. Even Icarus did not dare taste nectar and ambrosia; his father was a demigod, and his mother a naiad. Baby Miletus needed nourishment since a wetnurse could not be found, and goat milk alone would not sustain him.\n\n \n\nWith a heavy heart, Icarus informed Apollo of what had transpired when the god visited him the next day. Apollo was furious. Icarus asked him to ensure that whatever punishment he visited on Acacallis did not strike Ariadne. Ariadne, her other sister Xenodice, and their mother did not deserve to be punished for Acacallis' actions. Apollo agreed. Queen Pasiphae had already endure divine punishment once for the crime of another. Icarus did not want to see it happen again.\n\n \n\nTo punish the cruel princess, Apollo exposed her affair with Hermes and her new pregnancy. Hermes fled, not wanting to deal with the consequences as Minos beeseeched their father for justice. The king forgot that while he was a son of Zeus, so was Hermes. Hermes was a god, where Minos was not. Zeus would not care that Minos had been dishonoured by his godly brother, no matter how self-important King Minos felt he was or how many temples Minos built.\nUnable to do anything to the god that humiliated him, Minos turned his sight upon his daughter and the child in her womb. At first, he wanted to beat his daughter and her unborn demigod child to death, but Icarus intervened. He reminded Minos that the child had a very powerful god as a father. Hermes could very easily take offence if his child were harmed. Crete's wealth was tied up in commerce, Hermes' domain. If the god was to be insulted, he could financially ruin Crete with a snap of his fingers. Minos was well aware that he would be nothing without his vast wealth and mercantile connections.\n\n \n\nFurious and beet red with failure and humiliation, Minos held his hand. Once the baby was born, he tore the infant away from his mother and handed it to Icarus.\n\n \n\n\"What am I supposed to do with him?\" Icarus asked the king as he cradled the tiny baby.\n\n \n\nMinos glared at the inventor's son.\n\n \n\n\"It is your fault that the little bastard got to draw breath. You dispose of him!\" He hatefully spat, glaring at his baby grandson.\n\n \n\nIcarus's jaw dropped, and he gazed at the infant. He walked about the palace halls, not knowing what to do. He didn't think he could give another demigod to the herders. One demigod in one place was dangerous enough. Two of them would attract monsters like a lighthouse attracted ships in a storm. Especially sons of Olympians.\n\n \n\nWhile walking about with a sleeping baby, he run across petitioners from settlements in the west of Crete. They had come to see the king but had gotten to witness scandal. One man in particular peered at the baby and whispered something to his wife. The wife nodded to her husband with a smile and approached Icarus.\n\n \n\n\"Daedalides,\" she spoke and Icarus snapped to attention.\n\n \n\n\"We could not help but overhear your argument with the king. My husband and I have no children. We will be happy to raise a son of the god Hermes as our own. It would be a honor for our household.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus looked at the woman, trying to gauge her sincerity, she peered at the baby, a smile blossoming in her face and cooing helplessly as the infant opened his eyes.\n\n \n\n\"One of my maidservants had a stillbirth. Her breasts still have milk.\" The woman cajoled.\n\n \n\nIcarus looked at the baby and the woman.\n\n \n\n\"Very well. We will go to Hermes' temple so you and your husband can officially adopt him.\"\n\n \n\nHe handed her the baby, and the woman took him gladly, looking at him with a look of maternal longing. Her husband approached, nodding politely to Icarus and smiling down at his new adoptive son. Icarus took a deep breath of relief. Hermes' son was now safe. Possible godly wrath upon Crete was averted.\n\n \n\n\"Could we call him Cydon?\" The wife asked her husband.\n\n \n\n\"Of course, my dear. We can call him what you like.\" The husband responded, making faces to entertain the baby.\n\n \n\nMinos was not done. He decided that Acacallis had caused him enough disgrace. He banished his daughter from Crete. A ship was to take her to Libya and abandon her there. It was the last that Icarus heard of Acacallis. But it would not be the last Acacallis would hear of Icarus.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~\n\n \n\nModern Era:\n\n \n\nMichael Yew, dropped in camp when he was six years old after his mother's death, lived there peacefully and unremarkably for two years before his divine father, the sun god Apollo, threw the mythological world into chaos. Michael's older siblings often read him Olympus Weekly. Apollo appalled that the typical demigod dyslexia kept his children from intellectual pursuits, created special eyeglasses to counteract it. The glasses were a deeply coveted treasure, so Apollo ensured that only his children could use them.\nOlympus Weekly had reported strange behaviour from Apollo for years. He had been visiting Delos more often, often muttering about the Icarus tree. Apollo also applied for special permission to visit the Underworld and returned from there, cursing Hades for being a heartless old bastard. He then spent even more time in Delos, Olympus Weekly, faithfully recording each visit and the duration. He was still doing his duties and managing his domains, so no one was too worried.\nThen Apollo was photographed taking a golden-haired little boy, who was about three years old, to a mortal amusement park. Zeus had seen that picture and had been furious, rainstorms and thunder wrecking even Camp Halfblood. About a week after the picture, Apollo was forced to drop the child in the pictures with Chiron. Michael had overheard. His father had been incandescent with rage, and Chiron could barely placate him.\nApollo told Chiron about the enchantment of the Icarus tree and that while trying to get a vision of the third reincarnation of Hyacinthus, Apollo accidentally created Will. The sun god sternly warned the Centaur that Will better be safe or there would be Tartarus to pay.\nChiron had handed the little boy to Michael, who was only eight and had no idea what to do. Will was quite sad at first, sobbing for Daddy to come back. It was both heartbreaking and very irritating. Michael was also a son of Apollo, but he had never even seen his father before Will arrived. He had missed the first Winter Solstice due to being caught in a Cabin Eleven prank. Will had spent three whole years with their dad.\nMichael tried to be kind and patient with his little brother despite his misgivings. It was not Will's fault that their father truly loved him. Will had not chosen to be born and to be the son of Hyacinthus. Michael had heard plenty about Apollo's legendary love for Hyacinthus. When the Spartan Prince died, Apollo desperately asked for his beloved to be returned from death and, when denied, wished that he could die to be united with him. Both impossible. Apollo had refused to raise the sun for a long time before being cajoled by his twin and his mother. Even if Apollo was raising the sun, plagues still raged, healers failed, and musicians wailed.\nApollo managed to find some resemblance of peace, and Hyacinthus had been reborn as Icarus. Only to die again when he accidentally flew too high and fell too fast for their father to save him. Apollo's grief nearly destroyed civilization. Michael could see the despair in Chiron's eyes whenever the centaur looked at Will. One of Michael's older brothers wondered if there would be anything left if the third one died on their father again. Two others quickly slapped him down, telling him to be quiet.\nApollo convinced Zeus to let him see Will every three months for a day. Zeus relented, ending the scorching heatwaves, raging wildfires, multiple viruses of varying lethality, and subversive music. At least whenever Apollo picked up Will for the day, he hugged each one of them and gave them presents. Michael was delighted with the bow, eventful quiver and trick arrows. But in his heart, he knew that he would prefer to be in Will's place. It would never happen. His mother was no Hyacinthus.\nShortly before the fourth visit, the satyr Grover Underwood brought three demigods to camp. Thalia Grace, daughter of Zeus, who was born against the oath of the Big Three. A son of Hermes named Luke. And a daughter of Athena called Annabeth. Luke and Annabeth made it through. Thalia was not so lucky, and she had to stay behind to hold back the monsters so her friends could escape. Just as she was about to die, Zeus finally had some mercy for the daughter he condemned to a life of suffering and transformed her into a tree, preventing her from dying and her soul from passing in Hades' domain. Hades, the god of the Underworld, hated Thalia Grace intensely and had been trying to kill her since she was discovered. A least Luke and Annabeth were now safe.\n\n \n\n\"Will!\" Apollo's voice echoed through the camp as he descended from the sky. The little boy turned and ran towards him, his face lighting up joyfully.\n\n \n\n\"Daddy!\" Will shouted, throwing himself into Apollo's arms. Apollo lifted him up, hugging him tightly and peppering his face with kisses.\n\n \n\n\"Hello, my little sunshine,\" Apollo said, his voice filled with warmth. He then turned to his other children, hugging each one of them and dropping sackfuls of presents.\n\n \n\nLuke watched from a distance, his face twisted with barely concealed hatred as he recalled the father who abandoned him.\n\n \n\n\"Why does he get to do that?\" he demanded, turning to Chiron.\n\n \n\nChiron sighed, looking at Luke with a mixture of sympathy and caution.\n\"You were told who Will's mortal parent is. Apollo has always been insanely in love with Hyacinthus. Over three thousand years ago, he created Asclepius with the essence of the original hyacinth flower. Will is now the same.\"\n\n \n\n\"That's not fair!\" Luke protested.\n\n \n\n\"Life is rarely fair, Luke. Especially for a demigod,\" Chiron said.\n\"And remember, Apollo is very vengeful. It would be wise to keep your opinions to yourself. Especially where Hyacinthus and his two sons are concerned.\"\n\n \n\nAs the day drew close, Apollo returned with his favourite son and reluctantly said goodbye to Will, promising to return in three months. The little boy cried and clung to his father like a limpet. Apollo soothed the boy patiently before handing him to one of his older sons. There was anguish on the god's flawlessly beautiful face. Luke watched, his resentment growing. As he drifted off to sleep that night, he heard a voice whispering in his dreams.\n\n \n\n\"Luke,\" the voice said. It was Kronos, the Titan Lord. \"I have a proposition for you...\"\n\n \n\nLuke woke up, his heart pounding. He knew what he had to do. He started recruiting demigods to his cause, starting with the resentful ones in the Hermes cabin. The seeds of rebellion were sown. Luke became the perfect cabin counsellor to establish trust with the rest of the campers and Chiron. Soon it gave him unparalleled access to records. Luke was even entrusted with organizing the trip to Olympus on Winter Solstice for the year-rounders.\n\n \n\nLuke made sure to keep all the demigods at tables near each other, as per Chiron's advice. It would not do for anyone to go wandering off. This allowed him to witness when one of Artemis' hunters approached their group. Another for his cabin recognized her as Polyboea, half-sister of Hyacinthus, the former princess of Sparta. In a way, Will Solace's aunt.\n\n \n\n\"Will!\" Her voice called out, and all eyes turned to see Polyboea, a hunter of Artemis and former princess of Sparta, approaching the group of demigods.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus' boy,\" she said, her eyes softening as she looked at Will. But when she looked at the rest of the male demigods, her eyes showed the typical disdain a huntress had for males.\n\n \n\n\"It's good to meet you.\"\nPolyboea had brown eyes, brown hair, and olive skin. While far from ugly, she was nothing special to look at.\nOne of Aphrodite's daughters, unable to contain her curiosity, asked, \"Was Hyacinthus as beautiful as the myths say?\"\n\n \n\nPolyboea laughed, a sound that echoed through the hall.\n\"You are looking at me and thinking how a brother of mine could be a legendary beauty?\" The once princess teased with a smile.\n\n \n\n\"I loved him much more than my full brothers but Hyacinthus was my half brother. I took after my mother, a mortal woman. My brother resembled his mother, a goddess.\"\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus was gloriously beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that nearly all of the Kingdom of Sparta was in love with him. We would get travellers from far away coming to catch a glimpse of him. No one was disappointed. But he only had eyes for Apollo.\"\n\n \n\nHer gaze turned cold as she spotted Zephyrus with Eros across the room.\n\n \n\n\"I will hate the West wind as long as I draw breath, and long after I do not,\" she muttered, eyes gleaing with ancient hate, her fingers curling into claws.\n\n \n\nApollo moved away from Hermes and one of the muses to approach the demigod group and picks up Will, holding him in his lap. Polyboea seems displeased at seeing him. The muse lingered a bit of a distance away, her purple eyes on Will, sorrow in her inhumanly beautiful face.\n\n \n\nApollo glanced at the Spartan Princess tightlipped with annoyance.\n\n \n\n\"What is it this time, Polyboea?\"\n\n \n\nPolyboea glared at the god and pointed at Will\n\n \n\n\"How is the new incarnation going to react at being a parent?\"\n\n \n\nApollo hugged his little son tighter to himself.\n\n \n\n\"You were fortunate to spend even more time than me with both Hyacinthus and Icarus. You know how open-minded and kind-hearted they were and how fond they were of children. Will is absolutely precious and very easy to adore.\"\n\n \n\nPolyboea sighed as she angled her chin to where Eros was holding court with a few other minor gods.\n\n \n\n\"And what do you plan to do about Zephyrus? We god lucky that Icarus never met him, but now the news have spread.\"\n\n \n\nApollo gave a snarl that raised goosebumps on the demigods and his eye turned into burning gold.\n\n \n\n\"Zephyrus sold himself into slavery to escape my wrath once. There is not going to be a second time.\"\n\n \n\nPolyboea eyed Apollo in silence for a while before nodding. Turning back to Will, she said,\n\n \n\n\"I wish you all the best, Will. I hope that Apollo will find the third incarnation and that this time, it will end happily.\"\n\n \n\nBut her eyes held a hint of sadness, as if she didn't quite believe her own words.\n\nSmilax: I am not afraid to sacrifice my life, I will gladly do it twice\n\nAcacallis, proof that spoiled, braty teenage daughters have always been a thing\n\nLuke: Lets start my villain arc\n\nHyacinthus and Crocus grieve. Two demigods and two gods have a double date.Apollo makes a request.\n\nIcarus grapples with survivor guilt\n\nWill has a no good, very bad day. Apollo shows his destructive side.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nHyacinthus;\n\n \n\nIn the heart of Sparta, under the shadow of the shrine of Hades, Hyacinthus, the Prince of Sparta, and his best friend, Crocus, the Son of Poseidon, stood solemnly in front of the dark altar. Their hearts were heavy with grief as they mourned the loss of Smilax, Crocus' betrothed and the daughter of Aphrodite. The air was thick with the scent of burning incense, their silent prayers ascending with the smoke, pleading with Hades to welcome Smilax into Elysium for her eternal rest.\n\n \n\nAs they burned incense, Hyacinthus began the prayer, \"Hades, lord of the underworld, we beseech you to be kind to Smilax. Welcome her into Elysium.\"\n\n \n\nCrocus, his voice choked with emotion, added, \"May she find peace in your realm, far from the strife that marked her end.\"\n\n \n\nA year had passed since Smilax's tragic death. Neither Hyacinthus nor Crocus had been present at the time, but they had pieced together the events from the accounts of witnesses. Smilax had met with her mother, Aphrodite, and a heated argument had ensued. In her fury, Aphrodite had struck her daughter dead, transforming her body into a shrub. No explanation had been given for this cruel act of a lack of maternity, but people's imaginations had run. Thankfully, no one was besmeerching Smilax' reputation. She was well known to be a very proper Spartan lady. She was betrothed to a notable warrior and had been a childhood friend of the Crown Prince. Smilax had been well known to be pious. She visited temples regularly and made lavish offerings to the gods. Despite being perhaps the most beautiful woman in Sparta she never flaunted her beauty and was loyal to her future husband. Perhaps that was what enraged Aphrodite. Still, people did not dare to speak out against the goddess either.\n\n \n\nThe shrub, a living testament to Smilax's memory, was moved to the gardens of Crocus' manor. Hyacinthus had taken a few cuttings from it, planting them in the royal palace gardens and in the wild, ensuring that Smilax's memory would live on.\n\n\"Apollo has been my rock,\" Hyacinthus confessed to Crocus one day. \"He has helped me through my grief. I don't know what I would have done without him.\"His secret garden held a decent thicket of the shrub and he often liked to ponder life near it. Apollo always pulled him away when the prince took too long. It bothered the god that Hyacinthus could be this sad. As an immortal Apollo didn't quite understand grief. His family and most of his friends were gods, thus undying. Apollo had many children but he knew that they would eventually die, so he did not grieve like Hyacinthus seemed to be doing. He did his best to console his beloved. It was his steady, bright presence that helped the most. It reminded Hyacinthus that he still had love and joy in his life.\n\n\"I did not have friends when I was small. The boys always tried to show me up and got mad when they could not. The girls would just giggle and try to touch me. Among the Spartides my age, Smilax was the only one that could hold a normal, intelligent conversation with me and would keep her hands to herself.\"\n\n\"I didn't see her as much as I would have liked. Her father is a crass opportunist. He made it blatantly clear that he was aiming to make his daughter Queen. My father did not like her until Smilax was betrothed to Crocus, since he had his heart set on Danae of Argos. Grandmother did like Smilax. Considered her a jewel of sensibility and cunning, but father has the last word in everything.\"\n\n\"Smilax was so wary of me at first, she thought I would be like those demigod brothers of yours at camp but relaxed when she realised that I meant her no harm. She could always make me smile even during the most stultifying formal occasion.\"\n\n \n\n\"I will miss her.\" Hyacinthus wept on Apollo's shoulder.\n\n\"She was like a bigger Polyboea.\"\n\n \n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, Hyacinthus found solace in the arms of his lover, the god Apollo. Crocus, however, was consoled by the god Hermes. As the son of Poseidon grappled with his grief, he found himself developing romantic feelings for Hermes. It had only been a year since Smilax's death, and Crocus was anguished, feeling as though his burgeoning love for Hermes was an insult to his betrothed's memory.\n\n \n\nHyacinthus, seeing his friend's torment, reminded him of Smilax's protective nature. She had always shielded them from despair and sadness. Hyacinthus believed that Smilax would want nothing more than for Crocus to find happiness again, even if it meant falling in love so soon after her death.\n\n\"Smilax always shielded us from despair and sadness,\" he said. \"She would want you to be happy, Crocus. She would not want you to live in sorrow.\"\n\nCrocus looked at his friend, his eyes filled with gratitude at how understanding Hyacinthus was.\n\n\"You're right, Hyacinthus,\" he said. \"Smilax would want us to remember her with joy, not sorrow. I will try to honour her memory by finding happiness again.\"\n\n \n\nLike the shrubs that now grew in the gardens, the memory of Smilax would continue to live on, not as a symbol of sorrow but as a testament to enduring love and resilience.\n\n \n\nOne day, Crocus invited Hyacinthus to the athletic arena, where he often met Hermes. \"I think it's time you met Hermes,\" Crocus said. \"He has been a great comfort to me.\"\n\n \n\nTo their surprise, Apollo appeared, inviting himself along. \"I would like to come too,\" he said, a hint of alarm in his voice.\n\n \n\nHyacinthus was taken aback. \"Apollo, you seem...concerned. Isn't Hermes your favourite brother?\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded. \"Yes, he is. But this is about you and Crocus. I just want to make sure everything is alright. My brother is the god of mischief and trickery. He can be difficult and unpredictable.\"\n\n \n\nIn Sparta's athletic arena, Hermes, the messenger god, played with a disc while waiting for Crocus. His eyes sparkled at the sight of Crocus, but confusion clouded his features when he saw Apollo.\n\n \n\nCrocus stepped forward, gesturing towards Hyacinthus, the Prince of Sparta.\n\n \n\n\"Hermes, allow me to introduce you to Hyacinthus, the Crown Prince of Sparta. My closest friend.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus bowed respectfully, acknowledging the Olympian god. \"It's an honour to meet you, Hermes.\"\n\n \n\nHermes chuckled, \"So, you're the Hyacinthus I've heard so much about. The one who has won Apollo's heart and the attention of two other gods.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus rolled his eyes, \"I see my reputation precedes me.\"\n\n \n\nBut Hermes' attention had already shifted back to Crocus, a lovesick expression on his face. Apollo, however, was eyeing his brother with an expression of disdain.\n\n \n\nHyacinthus turned to Apollo, \"Why the sour look, Apollo? Isn't Hermes your favourite brother?\"\n\n \n\nApollo sighed, \"Yes, he is. But seeing him with Crocus... it's just... strange.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus placed a comforting hand on Apollo's shoulder, \"We all grieve and heal in our own ways, Apollo. Crocus has lost Smilax, and Hermes has been there for him. It's only natural that they've grown close.\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded, smiling at his beloved.\n\n \n\n\"You're right, Hyacinthus. I should be more understanding.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus smiled back, easily catching the disc thrown by Apollo and throwing it back swiftly, appreciating the easy and deadly grace with which his lover moved. Not far from them, Crocus and Hermes were doing the same but Hermes seemed to be telling a few jokes because Crocus was chuckling.\n\n \n\nEventually, fun games had to end. Hyacinthus was Crown Prince, and Crocus was his second in command. They had duties to attend to, too. Reluctantly, they took their leave of the gods. Hyacinthus stood on his tiptoes to give Apollo a goodbye kiss. Crocus briefly embraced Hermes. The two demigods left the arena at a run, leaving the two gods behind.\n\n \n\nThe two gods, Apollo and Hermes, remained in the arena, facing each other. The playful air that usually surrounded Hermes had vanished, replaced by a tense silence. Much like Hyacinthus, the messenger god had noticed Apollo's tension and unease.\n\n \n\n\"Why are you acting so strange, Apollo?\" Hermes finally broke the silence, his voice echoing in the empty arena.\n\n \n\n\"There's no need to be jealous. While your Hyacinthus is indeed the most beautiful mortal I've seen, I'm not such a fool as to go after him and make an enemy of you like that idiot Zephyrus.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's gaze was steady on his brother.\n\n \n\n\"It's not that, Hermes. I know you wouldn't dare, especially since you can't outrun me. But while you are the god of lies, I am the god of truth. And I see through your deception.\"\n\n \n\nHermes' smile faded. \"What are you talking about, Apollo?\"\n\n \n\nApollo's voice was firm as he accused, \"It wasn't Aphrodite who killed Smilax. It was you, out of jealousy. You framed Aphrodite. She might torment and punish her erring children severely, but she has never killed one. She prefers to break and remould them.\"\n\n \n\nHermes lost his smile completely, his face turning serious. There was a hint of anger in his eyes.\n\n \n\n\"Smilax found out about my interest in Crocus and confronted me out of jealousy. She dared to insult me. I lost my temper. It was unfortunate. I wouldn't have minded sharing Crocus with Smilax. A young man of standing needs to marry and have heirs. But she had to be unreasonable.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's expression hardened at the mention of marriage and heirs. Hermes just had to poked at a sore spot. He had gotten rid of Princess Danae, but thousands others were eager to take her place and dared to covet his beloved. Plaguing him with jealousy and anxiety. And, given how Hermes looked at Crocus, Apollo doubted he would tolerate a bride when one presented herself. Well, his foolish younger brother would learn. The mourning period was over, and while not as eligible as Hyacinthus, Crocus was considered a great catch by young maidens and their parents.\n\n \n\n\"You might have placed Hyacinthus and Crocus in danger if Aphrodite ever finds out.\" Apollo voiced his concerns.\n\n \n\nHe knew personally how destructive and vindictive Aphrodite and her brood could be. He found that out when the Daphne incident happened. Apollo had agonized for centuries over a nymph he only spoke sparse words with, who just run from him. If a love with such a flimsy foundation could haunt and poison him for centuries, what would a mutual love based on friendship, affection, and compatibility do to someone? Apollo did not want to find out.\n\n \n\nHermes shrugged, \"I covered my tracks well, and Aphrodite is fickle. She likely has forgotten the incident already.\"\n\n \n\nAs the two gods stood in the arena, the tension between them palpable, they were left to contemplate the consequences of their actions and the intricate web of relationships that bound them together.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nApollo, the god of prophecy, stood before his father, Zeus, the King of the gods, and his stepmother Hera, the Queen. His golden hair shimmered in the divine light as he spoke, \"Father, Stepmother, I come before you with a request. I seek immortality for my beloved Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta.\"\n\n \n\nZeus frowned, his thunderous voice echoing in the grand hall, \"Apollo, you are known to be fickle in love. If I grant this request and you move on, we will have quite a problem.\"\n\n \n\n\"But Father,\" Apollo interjected, \"As a god of prophecy, I know I will love Hyacinthus forever.\"\n\n \n\nZeus remained unmoved, \"Prophecy is vague and misleading, Apollo. I cannot grant your request.\"\n\n \n\nApollo turned to Hera, \"Stepmother, I will marry Hyacinthus. Marriage is an eternal bond, not always a union of love but of duty. Godhood has been granted to the spouse of a god before.\"\n\n \n\nThe two wind gods who had pursued his beloved Hyacinthus and been firmly rejected were among those gods whose spouses had been elevated. Zephyrus, the arrogant fool, had caught a glimpse of some nymph from the Isles of Blest, and when unable to just have his way with her, he had proposed marriage, which was likely what she had been after. That upstart flower goddess always left Apollo with a bad taste in his mouth. The very sight of her irritated him for some reason.\n\n \n\nBoreas also had fallen in love with a nymph, who had been made a goddess so she could share eternity with him. Apollo had dallied with Boreas and knew him and his wife fairly well. Orithyia was a lovely goddess, gracious and understanding. If nymphs could be made goddesses, then surely a demigod prince could be made a god. Hyacinthus was far worthier than the two, or their husbands would not have coveted him.\n\n \n\nHera, however, was not convinced, \"Apollo, marriage is to set up a proper, lawful household to raise legitimate children. You and Hyacinthus are both men. You can't marry.\"\n\n \n\nApollo, undeterred, reminded Hera, \"We are gods, Stepmother. We make the rules.\"\n\n \n\nHera, however, did not change her mind. \"Apollo, you and Hyacinthus can't have children together. That is the point of marriage--children that are heirs for the husband.\"\n\n \n\nApollo, desperate, declared, \"I am the god of healing and medicine. I can figure out a method for two men to have children together.\"\n\n \n\nHera's eyes widened in alarm, \"Apollo, you mustn't! If men can marry and have children, it will eliminate the need for women. As the goddess of women, I cannot allow that.\"\n\n \n\nApollo groaned. Why was everyone so ignorant?\n\n \n\n\"Hera, the method will not be available to everyone. Only gods will have access to it. Women will still be needed because procreation is not easy. One can't just snap infants into existence without consequences or defects. We are not Gaea, a primordial of creation. Besides, not every man will want to marry another man.\"\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, this was when Ganymede walked in, holding his chalice full of ambrosia for Zeus. Seeing him, the king of the gods perked up, a smile gracing his face. Hera glared first at her husband and then at the mortal-turned-god. Ganymede faltered and visibly wanted to flee, but Zeus gestured him closer.\n\n \n\n\"Your request is denied, Apollo!\" Snapped Hera.\n\n \n\nApollo gritted his teeth and had to leave as Hera began yelling at Zeus and insulting Ganymede. He would try again. As many times as it took. And if they still kept denying him, Apollo would make Hyacinthus immortal without their leave. He just needed to get a golden apple or take Ganymede's chalice. Hera and Zeus would just have to deal.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nThe Palace of Knossos was ablaze with light, its grandeur magnified by the flickering torches. The yearly Harvest Feast was underway, a grim event that marked the arrival of the Athenian tribute. Icarus, son of Daedalus, and Princess Ariadne, daughter of King Minos, were in attendance, their hearts heavy with the knowledge of the impending doom. They looked at each other as Icarus led Ariadne to their allotted seats. He helped the princess into the chair and then took his seat. The platters in front of them were laden with choice cuts of roast meat, flatbreads still warm from the oven, white crumbly cheese, glossy black olives, plump ripe figs and glistening dark purple grapes, but neither of them would be able to eat a single bite.\n\n \n\nAriadne, her face pale and her lips trembling with suppressed tears, quickly drained a goblet of wine. The effects were immediate, dulling her senses and providing a temporary escape from the horrifying reality. She slumped in her chair, her eyes glazed over, oblivious to the fearful whispers that filled the grand hall.\n\n \n\nIcarus, however, was not so fortunate. The wine had little effect on him, a trait he attributed to his lineage as the son of the naiad Naucrate, a daughter of the sea god Poseidon. His mother had passed away when he was but a year old, leaving him with no memories of her and no way to verify his immunity to the intoxicating effects of wine. Normally, he rejoiced in this; wine was dangerous and corrupting, but he would have loved a respite from the horror of this day.\n\n \n\nHis clear eyes took in the sight of the Athenian maidens, their faces pale and their bodies trembling as they were led into the hall. Of the youths that tried to be brave, stand strong with their heads held high. They were gawked at, their fear a spectacle for the heartless crowd. Icarus felt a surge of anger and helplessness, his fists clenching at his sides. Not for the first time, in the privacy of his mind, he cursed the cruel tyrant king.\n\n \n\nKing Minos rose to his feet, his voice echoing through the hall as he spoke of his dead son, Prince Androgeus. His words were filled with grief and anger, a father mourning the loss of his child. Icarus watched him, his heart heavy with distaste. Minos spoke of a father's pain, but he eagerly inflicted the same pain on other fathers. Each of those maidens and youths had fathers, mothers and others who loved them and would mourn their passing. Androgeus's death had been unintentional on the part of the Athenian king. It was traditional for the winners of athletic competitions to be offered a chance to go after a local menace or monster in order to obtain more renown. Minos was conveniently forgetting that. The prince also got a proper burial, ensuring his passage to Hades. The youths and maidens would not even have that if it was not for the system that Ariadne and Icarus had set up. They had bribed several of the servants who looked after the youths before they were thrown in the Labyrinth to give each one a small pouch containing one silver coin, a vial of quick-acting poison, and a small blade. For them to take matters into their own hands and to at least have coin for Charon the Boatman.\n\n \n\nThe feast was a reminder of the cycle of violence and retribution, a cycle that seemed impossible to break. Icarus could not wait for it to end. Once the feast was over, he could go home and spend the night in Apollo's arms. The sun god was excellent at distracting him from his worries. Ariadne had no such respite. Icarus prayed silently for Ariadne to find someone to love and share her joys and burdens with. He quickly caught himself. He had heard enough about the cruelty of the love gods from Artemis and the huntresses to wish Aphrodite or her son on his dear friend.\n\n \n\nAs the night wore on, Icarus and Ariadne shared a look of understanding. They were trapped in a world of gods and monsters, bound by the whims of fate. But they had each other, their friendship a beacon of hope in the darkness. And perhaps, just perhaps, they could find a way to change their destiny.\n\n \n\nAs the feast ended, Icarus hurried home to his father's fine mansion. In the solitude of his bedroom, he was met by his lover, the god Apollo. Seeing the distress on Icarus's face, Apollo moved to console him. His words were soft, a balm to Icarus's troubled soul.\"The Fates are cruel,\" he said, \"but one day, a hero will come, a son of Poseidon, who will slay the Minotaur. But for now, we must wait.\"\n\n \n\nTheir shared moment of solace was a small comfort in the face of the grim reality. But it was a comfort nonetheless, a promise of a brighter future amidst the darkness. And for now, that was enough.\n\n \n\nThe following day, as it was Icarus' habit after a Harvest Feast, first thing in the morning when Apollo left to raise the sun, Icarus made his way to the shrine of Hades. He was there to pray for the souls of the youths and maidens who had been sacrificed. He asked Hades to be kind and merciful to the unfortunate victims, his voice echoing in the silent shrine. The fine incense that Icarus had brought suffused the space. The other offerings were burning. It was strangely peaceful.\n\n \n\nHe was attended by a young priest named Nicodemus, who thanked Icarus for asking his father, Daedalus, to build the shrine. Icarus observed the priest. The young man, only a few years older than Icarus, had pin-straight, inky black hair, obsidian black eyes and very pale skin. Shadows seemed to behave strangely around him. He held himself with a demigod's casual, deadly, borderline inhuman grace. Sheer power was palpable in every gesture and movement. For some reason, Icarus was reminded of King Minos, his brothers and Heracles, even though the kind priest was nothing like the sons of Zeus. Icarus pondered on what it was that reminded him of them. He noted the shadows playing around the priest, and it hit him. This priest was a son of Hades.\n\n \n\nHades rarely had demigod children, being quite devoted to his queen, the fair Persephone. But Persephone left each spring, and the dark king got lonely. He was much more restrained and loyal than his brothers, but every so often, a mortal woman managed to hook his heart. Icarus was not surprised that Nicodemus only announced himself as a priest of Hades rather than his son. Children of Hades were widely feared, and all too often hated.\n\n \n\n\"Few people have the courage to properly honour the god of the underworld. Never seen shrines go up outside of the established sanctuaries of Hades or Sparta. The Spartans have never feared death.\" Nicodemus said, his voice filled with respect.\n\n \n\nIcarus pointed out that since the shrine went up, it had seen lots of use.\n\n \n\n\"People are realizing that they can easily pray for their deceased loved ones,\" he said, his voice soft.\n\n \n\nIcarus visits yearly on the anniversary of his mother's death or when a neighbour passes away. He was fortunate not to lose anyone whom he truly loved. He honored Naucrate's memory but he himself did not remember her at all. He had been only one year old when she had died, just weaned. When he thought of the word mother, Artemis's face came to mind. He always tried to banish that thought but never succeeded.\n\nNicodemus nodded, a thoughtful expression on his face.\n\n\"People often miss the obvious,\" he said. \"Death, while terrifying, is the only thing in life that is certain.\"\n\nIcarus had to agree that all mortals would one day die. Some sooner than others. Given that he himself had agreed to become the lover of the sun god, Icarus would likely die young. Apollo was the only person Icarus would ever love, but he knew how people who loved Apollo ended up dead well before their time. Icarus knew from the moment he realized that he was in love with the sun god that it would be the death of him, but could not walk away. Love was all-consuming and could not be denied.~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nModern Era:\n\n \n\nThe grandeur of Olympus was in full display, its halls echoing with laughter and merriment as the gods and demigods gathered for the Winter Solstice party. Among the attendees was a seven-year-old boy named Will Solace, the son of Apollo and the third Hyacinthus. Born from the essence of Apollo's greatest love, reborn for a third time, Will was his father's favourite, a beacon of light in the god's immortal existence.\n\n \n\n\"Will, my son, you light up Olympus just like your old man,\" Apollo said, ruffling Will's hair affectionately.\n\n \n\nWill, along with the other year-rounders from Camp Half-Blood, was in awe of the celestial spectacle. His father, Apollo, the sun god, greeted him with a warmth that rivalled the sun itself. Will's heart swelled with joy at the sight of his father's radiant smile. Will knew that his father was constantly looking for Will's mortal parent but so far had no luck. Apollo might have fallen in despair had it not been for Will's presence. Looking at Will gave Apollo renewed hope that he would find Hyacinthus again and, this time, save him from dying.\n\n \n\nHowever, amidst the celebration, Will noticed Asclepius, his full brother, lingering nearby. Asclepius watched him from a distance, his eyes filled with a longing mirrored Will's own. The muse Clio, the goddess of history and technically Will's grandmother, did the same. They wanted to approach, to share in the joy and warmth, but they held back.\n\n \n\nWill had once asked Apollo about their hesitation. Apollo had explained that Zeus was already annoyed that he was breaking the rules by interacting with Will. If Asclepius and Clio were to do the same, Zeus' wrath would be even greater. Unlike Apollo, they did not possess the same power and status to withstand Zeus' anger.\n\n \n\nZeus had been more irritable than usual since Thalia Grace had been transformed into a tree to save her from dying several years ago. The incident had stirred the waters of Olympus, casting a shadow over the otherwise joyous occasion. Zeus was still quite upset, something that was not helped by Hades, the god of the underworld, taunting him about it. Will would have thought it was cruel of Hades if his father had not told him the reason. After the Second World War, Hades had two demigod children. Zeus had killed them and their mother out of paranoia. Hades still held a grudge.\n\n \n\nWill noticed that Hades looked at him with the same annoyance he directed at Asclepius, who had angered Hades thousands of years ago by creating the cure for death. One time, when Will accidentally bumped into Hades, the god of the underworld, told him that he would be watching him, so Will did not follow in his brother's footsteps and warned him to stay away from gorgon blood.\n\n \n\nHades also complained about the paperwork that ensued every time Apollo had a heartbreak over Hyacinthus. To solve this, Hades put the rebirth on infinite hold. However, his son Zagreus, the god of rebirth, defied him. Zagreus always held a fondness for the legendary love story between Apollo and Hyacinthus and reincarnated him without Hades' permission. Will had reported all of this to his father, who had been quite happy for a moment, thinking that he could get Zagreus to tell him where Hyacinthus was. But then Apollo recalled that Zagreus had not left the Underworld in centuries due to the population increase, giving him a lot more work. Apollo could not go visit since Hades had officially banned him from the underworld about four years before Will was born.Apollo had bribed Hermes to go down and talk to Zagreus for him. Unfortunately, Zagreus had some grudge against Hermes. Not only did the god of rebirth refuse to tell Hermes anything but also snitched on Hermes. Hades had been furious. Hermes, given his duties as messenger of the gods could not be banned from the Underworld, but he could be supervised. When Hermes visited, he needed to be chaperoned by a Fury at all times. Will made sure to avoid Hades this year. They did not need any more trouble with the underworld.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, Will bumped into Poseidon, the sea god. Dressed in a colorful Hawaiian shirt adorned with images of angelsharks, daggerhose sharks, and great hammerheads, Poseidon was a sight to behold.\n\n \n\n\"Angelsharks, daggerhose sharks, and great hammerheads,\" Will blurted out, recognizing the endangered species on Poseidon's shirt.\n\n \n\nPoseidon looked down at him, a smile spreading across his face. Will noticed that Poseidon had green eyes, too. Just like him.\n\n \n\n\"Impressive, young one. You're familiar with sea life.\"\n\n \n\n\"I like the sea,\" Will replied. \"My dad bought me some picture books with sea animals.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon chuckled. \"No wonder. The second incarnation of Hyacinthus was my grandson Icarus. I only saw him twice from a distance because Artemis was overprotective. The first incarnation was close friends with my son Crocus. Hyacinthus was also descended from King Lelex, another son of mine and the founder of the Kingdom of Laconia. Sparta was landlocked but Icarus lived right next to the sea.\"\n\n \n\nHe then produced a large conch shell and handed it to Will.\n\n \n\n\"This will always have soothing sounds of the sea.\"\n\n \n\nWill took the shell and thanked Poseidon with a smile. For some reason, the sea god startled, looked at Will more closely before shaking his head.\n\n \n\n\"Not possible. I am being silly over a coincidence.\"\n\n \n\nThe god left and Will went back to his brothers. Michael gently took the conch shell from him to pack it safely in Will's backpack.\n\n \n\n\"Not only Apollo gives him special treatment, but Poseidon does too now!\"\n\nWill heard a hissed whisper. He turned around, trying to find out who had said but everyone was silent and looking elsewhere. The little boy decided to ignore it. Will knew that a lot of the campers were not happy that his dad got to break the rules. But it was rare for anyone to speak up, especially when his dad was around. A lot of them were not happy that Will existed. The Athena Cabin pointed out that a new occurrence of Hyacinthus meant that there was a very good chance of a civilization collapse in the near future. They had graphs and scenarios of what could happen if Apollo brought about another Dark Age into existence.\n\nEventually the party was over, the demigods had to go back to camp and the Olympians needed to have their formal Yearly Meeting. Apollo hugged Will goodbye as the boy followed his siblings and Chiron back to the camp bus. Apollo left for the throne room. Zeus would really be on a roll. Apollo needed to be fully present for the meeting.\n\n \n\nAs he took his seat on the bus next to Michael and Victoria, Will felt a sense of unease. The unease lingered until they stopped at Stony Brook which was their usual stop from the Empire Building to Camp Half Blood. They made the stop at a seaside park that had public washrooms. This way the demigods could use the facilities and stretch their legs for a short while before filing back in the bus to camp. The bus was enchanted not to attract monsters but the park was not. They could not linger long without monsters swinging by.\n\n \n\nIt was here where someone decided to strike. An unclaimed demigod from Cabin Eleven, fed up with Will's special treatment, decided to act. He used his skills with the mist to trick Will into wandering off, while making the other Apollo campers believe that Will was still with them. Chiron avoided paying much attention to Will. Too much ancient history, too many painful, bitter memories. Will had that smile that haunted Chiron, brought forth old guilt and old pains. Hyacinthus had left a mark even on the centaur. Not as much as Smilax, but enough.\n\n \n\n\"Hey Will,\" the demigod said, \"I think I saw a rare golden butterfly over there. You should check it out.\"\n\n \n\nWill, innocent and trusting, wandered off. As the mist wore off, he found himself alone. His vision cleared and he spun around terrified, trying to see the bus. It was long gone. Suddenly, he heard the growls of monsters approaching. He had no weapons, only his healing powers and some light manipulation. He should have taken his bow, but he had been on Olympus and the bus was safe. Will did not know what to do. An instinct told him to head for the sea. In his blood and soul he knew that the sea would be safe for him.\n\n \n\nHe ran, praying to his father, but Apollo was in the Solstice Meeting, unable to hear his prayers. Zeus liked to have the full attention of his fellow Olypians during the Yearly Meeting.\n\n \n\nWill was on his own. He jumped into the sea and swam away from the monsters as fast as he could. Somehow, he knew exactly where he was at sea and the route to Camp Half-Blood. The son of Apollo swam, the waves refreshing his energy, the currents felt soft and nonexistent, the icy temperature of the wintery wanters not registering. Will's medical training told him that this should be impossible, but Apollo's children always have higher than normal body temperature. It was his father's ichor, hidden under Will's red blood that was keeping him comfortable in the frigid waters.\n\n \n\nAs he swam at full speed, a pod of dolphins appeared, following him, occasionally providing assistance. He swam for miles, but to his surprise, he did not fatigue.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you, Father,\" he whispered, thinking that even if Apollo couldn't hear his prayers, he was still watching over him. The dolphins guided him back to Camp Half-Blood, where he was greeted with relief and joy by his cabin and more others. Lee quickly grabbed him into a tight hug and Will realised that his brother was crying. Michael approached.\n\n\"What where you thinking!\" Michael yelled.\n\n \n\n\"How could you wander off like that!\"\n\n \n\nVictoria approached Michael and placed an arm on his arm.\n\n \n\n\"He did not wander off. He was Misted, we all were.\"\n\n \n\nWill looked at his sister, feeling stricken. He could not recall the face and name of the demigod that pointed him to the golden butterfly. There should not be butterflies in winter.\n\n\"I..\" He started.\n\n\"I don't know what happened. Someone showed me a butterfly, and we went to see it. I then realized that the bus was gone, and I could hear monsters approaching.\"\n\nLee put Will down and looked at the pod of dolphins, still swimming nearby.\n\n \n\n\"The dolphins are one of Dad's sacred animals.\"\n\n \n\nAs if summoned by Lee's words, Apollo appeared, furious. Poseidon had told him what happened after hearing it from the dolphins. Will couldn't recall the demigod who had tricked him, but Apollo was able to see in Will's memory and remove the mist. He knew who it was.\n\n \n\nChiron tried to apologize. \"Lord Apollo, I...\"\n\n \n\n\"Silence, Chiron. I will not hear your excuses. This is not the first time you have been careless with what I hold most precious. Do you think Hyacinthus did not tell me about his experience at camp? Or that I don't remember the time when you let Asclepius wander off? Just like you did with Will now?\"\n\n \n\nApollo commanded his older children. \"Take Will back to the cabin. Dampen the sounds.\"\n\n \n\nLee, Michael, and Victoria immediately obeyed, their usually sunkissed faces rather pale. While they had only seen their father's sunny and loving side, they all knew the myths. They knew just how terrifying their father could be. His wrath had been feared for excellent reasons. Chiron tried to leave, but Apollo ordered him to stay.\n\n \n\n\"This is both a punishment for the demigod that tried to murder Will and a lesson for you to be more careful in the future.\"\n\n \n\nApollo grabbed the demigod out of Hermes' cabin. He threw him in the dirt, ripped his skin off while using his powers to keep him alive. The demigod bleed copiously, his muscles and nerve tissues exposed. He screamed in agony, begging for mercy and forgiveness, pleading that he was sorry. Apollo ignored it, his mouth set of a tight line, yes blazing like golden fire. Chiron watched stoically, utterly still. The centaur barely dared to breathe.\n\n \n\nEventually, Apollo grew tired of the screaming and incinerated the demigod. \"There will not be any shroud ceremony or burial rites,\" Apollo told Chiron. \"Let this be a lesson to all.\"\n\n \n\nLuke Castellan watched from the door of the Hermes cabin, his hands tight into fists.\n\n\"This is not justice,\" Luke muttered under his breath, but no one heard him.\n\n \n\nHe had seen how the wrathful sun god had burst into their cabin, which was supposed to be safe and had dragged one of their members out and had tortured him before slaughtering him like an animal. At least the dead unclaimed demigod had not told Apollo about the cause. The gods did not know about the incipient rise of Kronos.\n\nPoseidon: Essence baby gestated by the tree that was my grandson. Essence baby has eyes just like mine, Percy's smile and knows his sharks. Just coincidence. Just coincidence. I don't have a demigod son.\n\nLater Poseidon: That essence baby with Percy's eyes and smile is able to swim for miles in ice cold waters, against the current and find his way at sea. Dolphins really seem to like it. I am sure it is all due to dolphins being Apollo's sacred animal and the fact that he was often prayed by sailors for guidance at sea.\n\nApollo: DON'T HURT MY HYA BABY!\n\nYet another someone makes the mistake of challenging gods to contests of talent and skill.\n\nHyacinthus has an awful experience.\n\nIcarus almost does something foolish, forcing Apollo to resort to strange measures\n\nPercy finds out and Grover really messes up.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nIn the ancient lands of Greece, Thamyris, a gifted and famous musician from Thrace and grandson of Apollo, was madly in love with Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta. The fabled musician had travelled far and wide, but he had never seen the like of the Spartan Prince. The gods had given him every possible gift: beauty, talent, martial prowess, intelligence and kindness. Hyacinthus, mostly renowned for his beauty, was pursued by mortals and gods alike. Yet, his heart belonged to none other than the sun god Apollo. Hyacinthus had rejected all suitors except the golden Olympian.\n\n \n\nThamyris, heart heavy with unrequited love, decided to share a cautionary tale with Hyacinthus. He recounted the story of his grandmother, Philonis, who boasted about her affair with Apollo and Hermes. Her pride and insinuations of simultaneously seeing both gods led to her downfall, as an angered Apollo shot her through the mouth with an arrow.\n\n \n\nThamyris had approached Hyacinthus, his voice trembling with emotion. \"Prince Hyacinthus,\" he began, \"I must tell you a tale. It is a tale of my grandmother, Philonis, who boasted about her affairs with both Apollo and Hermes. Her pride led to her downfall, as an angered Apollo shot her through the mouth with an arrow.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus listened to Thamyris' tale but confessed that his love for Apollo was unwavering. As the son of Clio, the Muse of History, he was well-versed in the deeds of Apollo - the good, the beautiful, and the ugly. He acknowledged Philonis' folly, stating that mortals should know better than to cheat on a god.\n\n \n\n\"Thamyris,\" the prince replied after patiently listening to Thamyris's tale, \"I am the son of Clio, goddess of History, thus well-versed in the deeds of Apollo - the good, the beautiful, and the ugly. Yet, my love for him is unwavering. Philonis should have known better than to cheat on a god. Mortals who dare to do so meet only one end - death. There is no higher dishonour than infidelity. Mortals will kill their lovers for infidelity. What do you expect a god to do?\"\n\n \n\nThe prince recalled one more detail of the tale of Philonis. She had boasted that she was more beautiful than the goddess Artemis. Yet another thing that was just not done. No mortal woman could boast that her beauty was greater than a goddess's, even when that goddess was an eternal maiden who shunned the company of men with vehemence. Kindly, Hyacinthus chose not to mention that to Thamyris. The musician was humiliated enough with his family drama.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus,\" Thamyris lamented, \"you will never even look at me. My heart aches for you, yet you have eyes only for Apollo.\"\n\n \n\nThamyris was left heartbroken by Hyacinthus' words. His love for Hyacinthus would never be reciprocated, and he could only express his sorrow through his music. He did this for years as he watched the prince love the god. Apollo usually grew bored of his mortal lovers quickly. At most, he stayed for a few seasons. It had been nearly four years since Prince Hyacinthus' meeting with Apollo. The sun god's devotion remained unchanged. Apollo visited Hyacinthus almost daily. During the day, they hunted, exercised or played music together. In the night, together, they retreated to Prince Hyacinthus' private quarters. In his despair, Thamyris learned that Clio bore a striking resemblance to her son, Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\n\"If I cannot have Hyacinthus,\" he resolved, \"perhaps I can find solace in his mother's arms.\"\n\n \n\nSeeing no other option, Thamyris decided to try to attract Clio. He challenged the Muses to a music competition, hoping to win Clio's favour. His heart ached for Hyacinthus, but perhaps he could find some solace in his pursuit of Clio. Maybe earning the love of a goddess would make him forget the rejection of a demigod prince.\n\n \n\nDetermined, Thamyris set out to go to Helicon, where muses often dwelled. It was also the birthplace of Prince Hyacinthus. The musician travelled on foot to Cyparissia. A beautiful town on the sides of one of the offshoots of the range of mountains runs along this part of the Messenian coast. The charming town had one flaw. It was home to a large temple of Apollo, which dominated the place. It also bore the name of another lover of Apollo, whom the god had transformed into a cypress tree. Thamyris had no choice; he had to go to the temple to pay his respects before he could access the shipyards and board a ship to the Isthmus of Corinth. One step closer to Mount Helicon.\n\n \n\nPraying must have worked because the seas were smooth and the ship quick. At the Isthmus of Corinth, he had to stop by the temple of Poseidon to thank the sea god for the sea journey. He then walked to Corinth, where he took yet another ship to drop him off at Thespiae in Boeotia. From there, he walked to Mount Helicon.\n\n \n\nThe slopes of Mount Helicon were adorned with untamed and lush forests, a verdant tapestry woven from countless shades of green. Ancient trees reach skyward, their gnarled roots delving deep into the fertile soil, while their leafy canopies provide a sanctuary for many creatures. The air here is filled with the rustling of leaves and the songs of birds, a symphony of life that echoes through the forest.\n\n \n\nWinding through the forest is the Hippocrene, a stream as pure and sparkling as the morning dew. Born from the hoof of the winged horse Pegasus, the sacred stream is said to bestow the gift of poetry and inspiration upon those who drink from its crystal-clear waters. The gentle murmur of the flowing water adds a soothing melody to the forest's symphony, creating a serene atmosphere. Thamyris had to observe the stream. He had caught a glimpse of Pegasus before going to Sparta. It was difficult to believe that so noble a creature had been born to a monster as merciless and deadly as Medusa.\n\n \n\nThamyris followed the stream and found himself before the Palace of the Muses. A grand edifice, built by the divine hands of the Hephaestus himself, is as inspiring as the Muses who dwell within. Majestic columns of gleaming marble supported a roof adorned with intricate friezes depicting scenes of epic tales and heroic deeds. The musician had to pause and stare. He had visited many royal courts and seen many palaces, but this one put every mortal palace to shame.\n\n \n\nThamyris pressed forward and stopped by the entrance. There, he announced his challenge to the muses.\n\n \n\n\"I, Thamyris, challenge the Muses to a music competition. If I win, I ask for the charms and favours of Clio.\"\n\n \n\nThe first Muse to meet him was Calliope, the Muse of Epic Poetry and leader of the daughters of Mnemosyne. While furious at his presumption, she nevertheless allowed him to proceed.\n\n \n\n\"Very well, Thamyris,\" she said, steely resolve in her divine voice, \"we accept your challenge.\"\n\n \n\nFollowing Calliope, Thamyris was led to the Hippocrene, where the Muses played their instruments. Clio sat at a stone dais, a golden lyre in her hands. Thamyris was speechless by her beauty, dark curls and purple eyes identical to her son's.\n\n \n\n\"Clio,\" he stammered, \"you.. You.. are. Beautiful.\"\n\n \n\nClio sneered at him, an utterly unimpressed expression on her lovely, flawless face.\n\n \n\n\"How do you presume to challenge us when you can't even speak?\"\n\n \n\nThamyris composed himself and praised Clio's beauty with much more eloquence.\n\n \n\n\"You look so much like your beautiful son.\" He added at the end of his speech.\n\n \n\nClio froze, her motherly instincts acting with a vengeance, making her jump to her feet, glaring at the mortal.\n\n \n\n\"How do you know my son?\" she harshly demanded.\n\n \n\n\"We have met,\" Thamyris replied.\n\n \n\n\"I sang at Prince Hyacinthus' fifteenth birthday.\"\n\n \n\nClio finally remembered him. Had her mother, Memnosyne, been there, Clio would have been scolded ferociously for this memory slip. Memnosyne recalled everything and expected everyone to do the same, especially her daughters.\n\n \n\n\"Ah, yes,\" she said. \"You made my sweet Hyacinthus very uncomfortable with your crass, vulgar songs. He fled to the gardens, where he was almost beset by the god Zephyrus. Had I not arrived in time to threaten him into leaving, I shudder to think what would have become of my one and only child.\"\"Had you held your tongue, that winged pest might have never seen my son, and Hyacinthus would have been safer.\"\n\n \n\nErato giggled, cooing as she recalled the many songs Apollo had sung and the many poems he had written about her nephew.\n\n \n\n\"Well, dear sister. No one will trouble my nephew now that our golden lord is his lover.\"\n\n \n\nClio pursed her lips.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo comes with his challenges. I would have preferred if my son had avoided any amorous entanglements with any gods.\"\n\n \n\nCalliope clapped her hands, giving the mortal a smile that exposed her sharp and white teeth. The eyes of the leader of the muses gleamed with an anticipatory sadistic glee. Calliope knew her sisters. This was not the first time a mortal had dared to challenge them. Clio usually sat out of the punishment, preferring to observe dispassionately and record the event in excruciatingly accurate detail. But this time, it was different. The mortal had poked at Clio's one weakness. Calliope would get to see her logical, rational sister go savage. It would be epic.\n\n \n\n\"Beloved sisters, let us focus on this challenge. We can discuss our lord and Clio's boy later.\"\n\n \n\nCalliope declared the competition had started. Thamyris sang his best songs and played his best melodies. Each one of the muses played after him. The muses were much, much better. Thamyris realized that he had lost. But he was unwilling to accept complete defeat and relinquish what he coveted. He asked the fair and enchanting Clio if his talent and daring had stirred her heart.\n\n \n\nClio sneered at him in distaste. \"You dare to challenge gods and presume to believe yourself better than us? Your hubris is your downfall.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, Clio and her sisters descended on Thamyris and ripped him. Clio was leading the charge for the first time. All the muses agreed that she deserved it. The mortal had offended her honour and had been a nuisance to her child. They discarded the pieces of the body at the foot of their mountain, a warning to whoever would dare to challenge them. The tragic tale of Thamyris' unrequited love and his fatal challenge to the Muses would echo through the ages, a testament to the destructive power of love and the consequences of hubris. Love is the house where logic, sense and reason go to die.\n\n \n\nIn the grand halls of the Spartan Royal Court, Prince Hyacinthus stood beside his lover, the God Apollo. The golden light of the setting sun streamed through the open windows, casting long shadows on the marble floor.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus,\" Apollo began, his voice echoing in the silent hall, \"I bring news of Thamyris.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus frowned, \"Thamyris? The bard who left months ago without even proper notice? My father was furious at having to replace him quickly.\"\n\n \n\n\"Yes, the very same,\" Apollo confirmed, his face solemn.\n\n \n\n\"Thamyris went to Mount Helicon and issued a challenge to the muses. He pitted his musical skills against your mother and your aunts.\"\n\n \n\n\"But that's absurd!\" Hyacinthus exclaimed, \"He was good, I will admit it, but not divine. He was no match for you or my mother, Clio. For the Muses sake, even I am better than him!\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded, \"Indeed, it was a foolhardy challenge. But there's more. In case of victory, Thamyris demanded...,\" he hesitated, \"sexual favours from your mother.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus' face turned red with anger, \"What?! Did he dare to disrespect my mother in such a way? I will kill him!\"\n\n \n\nApollo held a hand, amusement on his face, \"There's no need, my love. Thamyris is already dead.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus' eyes widened, \"Dead? I will kill him twice, then! Where is his corpse?\"\n\n \n\nApollo sighed, \"The muses ripped him to pieces and threw the pieces at the foot of the mountains. Beasts have long devoured his remains.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus was silent for a moment, his fists clenched at his sides. Just the thought that Thamyris had dared to presume such things of his mother made Hyacinthus' blood boil.\n\n \n\n\"Even so,\" he said finally, \"it doesn't change the fact that he dared to make such demands of my mother. It's unforgivable.\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded, placing a comforting hand on Hyacinthus' shoulder, placating his prince. He understood his beloved's fury and disgust. When Apollo was a very young god, a disgusting giant dared to try and violate his mother. While Leto was on her way to Apollo's new temple, nonetheless, Apollo had shot the disgusting creature dead to rescue his mother. It still made his ichor boil to recall that the giant had managed to snatch Leto's veil off her head. If Apollo had been a bit slower...\n\n \n\n\"I understand your anger all too well, my love. But remember, the muses have already delivered their justice. Thamyris paid the price for his hubris.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, under the setting sun, the lovers stood, united in their shared outrage, yet finding solace in each other's presence. Hyacinthus rested his head on Apollo's chest, breathing in the scent of sunshine. The god's arms wrapped around him, enveloping the prince in warmth.\n\n \n\nSeeing his lover still upset, Apollo suggested, \"Let's take a walk in the gardens. It might help distract you from such things.\"\n\n \n\nSeveral large and divinely blessed swans awaited as they entered the lush gardens. Hyacinthus' eyes lit up at the sight of the gorgeous birds. The prince laughed, delighted and enchanted. The birds snapped to attention at the sight of Apollo.\n\n \n\n\"These swans are a gift to you, Hyacinthus,\" Apollo said, smiling at his lover's joy.\n\n \n\n\"Like all swans, they are incredibly vicious, and I have trained them to protect you.\"\n\n \n\nApollo then gestured to a chariot, \"These swans don't just act as guards. They can also pull a flying chariot. I know how talented you are in charioteering. You recently won the Chariot races of Sparta, which had competitors from all of Hellas. Now, I want to teach you how to drive a flying chariot.\"\n\n \n\nApollo gestured towards a splendid chariot, its intricate design and craftsmanship divine.\n\n \n\n\"This chariot,\" Apollo continued, \"is a gift from Hephaestus' forges, made especially for you.\"\n\n \n\nTogether, the two lovers harnessed the swans to the chariot, their excitement palpable. Once the swans were secured, they climbed into the chariot, Apollo taking the reins first. With a swift command, the swans took off, pulling the chariot into the sky.\n\n \n\nThey flew around Sparta, the wind rushing past them as the city shrank below. Apollo easily handled the reins, showing Hyacinthus how to guide the swans. After a few rounds, Apollo handed the reins to Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\nThe prince had a few hiccups at first, the chariot swerving slightly as he got used to the sensation of flying. But he was a quick learner, and soon, he guided the chariot confidently, making Apollo beam with pride.\n\n \n\nAs they soared through the sky, Apollo couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment. His lover was safe, protected by the swans, and now, he could fly alongside him. He had taken Hyacinthus on the sun chariot quite a lot of times. His prince had always delighted in flying. Apollo had once let Hyacinthus hold the reins of the sun chariot. For caution's sake, Apollo had been behind Hyacinthus, enveloping the prince with his larger body, the god's hands hovering over the demigod's, just in case. There had been no need. Hyacinthus had driven the sun for close to an hour before becoming exhausted. Apollo had taken over, Hyacinthus leading against him. But it had been proof that his beloved deserved to become a god.\n\n \n\nIn the Hephaestus-forged chariot driven by swans, Apollo and Hyacinthus take turns holding the reins, their laughter echoing through the heavens. The sight of Hyacinthus, flushed with joy and excitement, stirs a deep longing within Apollo. He yearns to share his immortality with his prince, to have him by his side for all eternity.\n\n \n\nYet Apollo has kept this desire a secret. Zeus and Hera had denied his request for Hyacinthus' immortality. They believed that Apollo's love for the mortal prince would wane, making the gift of immortality unnecessary. But Apollo, the god of prophecy, knew better. He knew his love for Hyacinthus was eternal.\n\n \n\nThey had been together for four years, much longer than Apollo had spent with any other lover. His loyalty to Hyacinthus remained unbroken, his love unwavering. Apollo's resolve hardened as he watched Hyacinthus guide the swan-drawn chariot across the sky. He could not lose this bliss.\n\n \n\nHe became determined to secure either the golden apple of immortality or the chalice of the gods. Both held the power to transform Hyacinthus into a god, ensuring that Apollo would never have to part from him. The thought of Hyacinthus joining him in immortality filled Apollo's heart with hope and anticipation. Apollo wanted nothing more than to keep his lover with him always.\n\n \n\nAnd so, the sun god set out on his quest, driven by love and the promise of eternal companionship. Unbeknownst to Hyacinthus, Apollo was ready to move heaven and earth to make him a god. For in Apollo's eyes, Hyacinthus was already divine.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nOne warm day in late spring, Apollo invited his beloved, Prince Hyacinthus, for a grand vacation across Hellas. The prospect of such an adventure filled Hyacinthus with excitement, his heart fluttering at the thought of exploring the vast lands of Hellas, hand in hand with his divine lover.\n\n \n\nBefore embarking on their journey, they sought the blessing of King Amyclas, Hyacinthus' father and the ruler of Sparta. King Amyclas expressed his concerns about his heir being away for an extended period. Understanding the king's worries, Apollo assured him that the three months would pass swiftly. With a heavy heart, yet trusting Apollo's words, Amyclas consented. Apollo also felt that Amyclas placed far too much on Hyacinthus' shoulders and needed to be taught a lesson. The king had Hyacinthus build temples before the prince was even officially considered a grown man. For years Hyacinthus had been handling duties that kings usually did. While it was good training for the future, it also was too much.\n\n \n\nWith the king's reluctant blessing, Apollo and Hyacinthus embarked on their journey. Apollo, driving his sun-chariot, took Hyacinthus to many cities. They visited Argos, the city of heroes; Elis, the site of the Olympic Games; Mycenae, the city of gold; Corinth, the city of two seas; Athens, the city of wisdom; and Thebes, the city of tragedies. With its unique charm and history, each city left Hyacinthus in awe. Seeing the joy and wonder in his lover's eyes, Apollo felt his heart swell with happiness.\n\n \n\nTheir final stop was Delphi, the city of Apollo's most famous oracle. Apollo showed Hyacinthus around the city, introducing him to his priesthood and ordering them to show Hyacinthus every honour. The priests, respecting their god's command, treated Hyacinthus with utmost reverence, making him feel welcomed and cherished.\n\n \n\nTheir journey across Hellas was not just a vacation but a celebration of their love, a testament to their bond. It was an adventure that brought them closer, an experience that they would cherish for eternity. And though they knew their journey would eventually end, the memories they created would forever remain etched in their hearts. Before long, they would have to go back to their duties.\n\n \n\nDuty came calling far sooner than expected. He was wearing winged sandals, chlamys flapping in the summer breeze, and a cap over his black curls. Just a week into their visit in Delphi, Hermes, the messenger of the gods, appeared. He brought news that Zeus was calling an emergency meeting and that they needed to return to Olympus.\n\n \n\n\"Brother,\" he said, addressing Apollo, \"Zeus calls for an emergency meeting. We must leave for Olympus immediately.\"\n\n \n\nApollo, who had cleared his schedule well in advance to spend time with his lover, was displeased. He voiced his frustration.\n\n \n\n\"But I had planned this visit,\" he protested, his voice laced with disappointment.\n\n \n\nSharing his brother's sentiment, Hermes revealed that he, too was not happy. He had also managed to carve out some precious time to spend with his own lover, Crocus, before their father, Zeus had summoned him.\n\n \n\nHermes sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"I understand, Apollo. I'm not thrilled either. I had managed to carve out some precious time with Crocus.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus, understanding the gravity of the situation, stepped forward. \"Apollo, you must go,\" he said gently. \"The king of the gods can't be kept waiting.\"\n\n \n\nApollo looked at his lover, his eyes softening. He leaned in, giving Hyacinthus a lingering kiss. \"I will return as soon as I can,\" he promised.\n\n \n\nWith that, Apollo and Hermes disappeared, leaving Hyacinthus alone in Delphi. But Hyacinthus was not one to wallow in loneliness. He decided to entertain himself while he waited eagerly for his godly lover to return. He explored the city, interacted with its people, and immersed himself in its culture. Still, Hyacinthus was a demigod. He needed more activity than visiting grand buildings and listening to musicians play. The prince decided to take this swan-driven flying chariot for a ride.\n\n \n\nHyacinthus was high in the air, hearing the trumpeting of his swans. The birds had been an odd sight in Sparta. They liked to stay in Hyacinthus' gardens most of the time, but sometimes, they would follow the prince around like ducklings. Crocus always struggled not to laugh when he saw the prince walking by, swans in his wake. As Apollo had promised, the birds were loyal and vicious.\n\n \n\nFlying with them was a delight. Hyacinthus could leave the ground and be in the air, removed from all concerns. A breeze flowed around him as he lapped around the sky, whooping with joy, echoed by his pet swans.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, the wind became strong, suspiciously strong. Hyacinthus registered that it was blowing from the west, and his blood turned to ice.\n\n \n\n\"Turn around!\" He commanded the swans.\n\n \n\n\"Back to Delphi!\"\n\n \n\nThe swans instantly obeyed and started pulling him to the nearest temple of Apollo as quickly as they could, strain visible in their white bodies. A temple of Apollo would be safe. Only a stronger god than Apollo could enter the temple with impunity. Zephyrus, while a god in his right, was nowhere as powerful as Apollo, a son of Zeus and an enthroned Olympian.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, Hyacinthus was in the air, in Zephyrus' domain, and the sun had gone down. Perhaps realising that the god of the west wind had attacked, Hyacinthus was forced to land the chariot roughly. He then ran towards the nearest temple of Apollo.\n\n \n\nThe swans, loyal to their master, viciously attacked Zephyrus, buying Hyacinthus some time. But Zephyrus, in his rage, killed the swans. The shrieks of his beloved pets reached Hyacinthus' ears, but he had to keep running.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately for the demigod prince, Zephyrus was as fast as the wind. He managed to get a hold of Hyacinthus, ripping off his himation and tearing up his chiton.\n\n \n\n\"Stop fighting me,\" Zephyrus demanded, attempting to get Hyacinthus on his back and trying to get on top of him.\n\n \n\n\"Leave me alone!\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus screamed in horror and disgust, struggling against the god, tapping into the ichor in his veins more than before. With a burst of rare, inhuman strength, he managed to push off Zephyrus and injure the god, drawing golden ichor, but in doing so, Hyacinthus felt something shatter within him. It almost felt like a glass sphere in his guts, a curiosity that Apollo had shown him once. Hyacinthus felt it crack, but it stayed whole. He did not understand what it was but could not ponder it. He had to get away to reach the temple.\n\n \n\nWhile Zephyrus was briefly stunned, Hyacinthus reached the temple and collapsed in front of a statue of Apollo. Apollo immediately appeared, holding his bow. He shot multiple arrows at the fast-approaching Zephyrus, forcing the wind god to flee when faced with the wrath of an Olympian. Hyacinthus knew that the arrows hit their mark. His lover never missed. The prince hoped that they hurt.\n\n \n\nApollo then checked on Hyacinthus, drawing the prince close to him, pressing a tender kiss on his forehead and wiping his sweaty locks away from his pale face.\n\n \n\n\"Are you alright?\" he asked, concern evident.\n\n \n\n\"I'm somewhat injured,\" Hyacinthus replied, checking his body, \"but I managed to prevent him from... from...\" He couldn't finish the sentence; the incident had left him deeply shaken. Hyacinthus felt Apollo's healing light suffuse his body, and he relaxed, finally feeling safe. Tears stung his eyes as his whole frame shook with tremors as if it were the deep of winter.\n\n \n\nApollo nodded, understanding, swallowing down his rage at Zephyrus for daring to lay hands on his beloved. He could not be angry right now. Hyacinthus was deeply shaken and needed comfort. Apollo needed to be a protector and healer, not a destroyer and avenger.\n\n \n\n\"Rest now, my love,\" he said, taking Hyacinthus to his Delphic Palace to rest and recover.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIcarus:\n\n \n\nIn the grand throne hall of King Minos, Icarus, son of Daedalus, watched with a heavy heart as several men were condemned to be fed to the Minotaur. Beside him, his best friend, Princess Ariadne, shared his silent anguish. The evidence was scant, the accusations of treason based on the testimony of a single man who stood to profit from their downfall.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" Ariadne whispered, her voice barely audible over the clamour of the court.\n\n \n\n\"You mustn't speak up. Father... he does not take kindly to defiance.\"\n\n \n\nThe princess knew her lifelong friend well. Icarus hated seeing injustice done to others, especially the powerless. She saw it when he defended her from the taunts and cruel words of her older sister, Acacallis. She had seen it when he prevented the guards from harassing the maidservants. While it was one of the reasons he was so dear to her, Minos' grand throne room was not the place to be a good and outspoken man. If there was a place where her father would broker no resistance and defiance, it would be where he had been declared king, where he felt the most powerful.\n\n \n\nIcarus clenched his fists, his amber gaze never leaving the condemned men.\n\n \n\n\"This isn't justice, Ariadne. It's a horrific farce and mockery of justice.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne's hand found his, her grip tight and pleading. The princess took a deep, shuddering breath. Ever since Acacallis's disgrace, her father had been harsher with her and her remaining sisters. Xenodice was desperate to join a temple and get away from the palace. Phaedra was too young to understand why their father was so mean to her. Ariadne could just endure in silence.\n\n \n\nTheir father had grown fond of throwing the story of Princess Scylla to their faces: Scylla, the daughter of King Nisus of Megara. Nisus possessed a single lock of purple hair, granting him and the city invincibility. When Minos, the King of Crete, invaded Nisus's kingdom, Scylla saw him from the city's battlements and fell in love with him. To win Minos's heart, she decided that she would grant him victory in battle by removing the lock from her father's head and presenting it to Minos.Ariadne often asked herself what that princess had seen in her father to fall so deeply in love with him. Minos was already too old when he invaded Megara, and he was well-known for being cruel. What did a beautiful young princess see in him? Ariadne had to wonder if it was the caprice of a love god. Perhaps Zeus had ordered one to make the princess love Minos in order to give his kingly son an easier time conquering Megara.Minos, however was disgusted that a daughter would be so treacherous towards her father. He bound her to the prow of his ship, letting her hang on cruel chains, the winds constantly throwing her around. She wept with pain and regret. She prayed to the gods and finally, one took pity on her and transformed her into a seabird, an egret. Unfortunately, it was not the end of her suffering. Her father Nisus, angry at her betrayal, was transformed into a sea eagle and relentlessly pursued her.\n\n \n\nAfter telling them this gruesome tale, Minos liked to remind Ariadne and her sisters that he had no use for treacherous daughters.\n\n \n\n\"King Minos has no use for treacherous daughters.\"\n\n \n\n\"I know, Icarus. But remember what happened with Cydon. You stood up to my father then, and he has not forgotten. I have seen how he glares at you when Daedalus is not around.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus turned to look at her, his eyes reflecting the pain of memory. He had indeed stood up to Minos, defending Cydon, the son of Princess Acacallis and the god Hermes, from the king's wrath. It had been a bold move, reminding Minos of the dire consequences of offending a god. Especially the god of trade and merchants. They were an island. Without trade they would starve within the year. It had also reminded Minos of his own past offence against Poseidon, which had resulted in his wife's infidelity with a bull.\n\n \n\n\"I can't just stand by, Ariadne,\" Icarus said, his voice filled with frustration.\n\n \n\n\"These men don't deserve this.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne's eyes filled with tears as she looked at her friend. \"Icarus, I beg you. Don't challenge my father again. I... I love you more than my brothers. I couldn't bear it if something happened to you.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus looked at her, his heart aching at the fear in her eyes. \"Even if I am the lover of Apollo, Ariadne, your father has shown he is willing to challenge the gods.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne nodded, her hand squeezing his tighter. \"That's why you need to be careful, Icarus. Please, for me.\"\n\n \n\nAs the condemned men were led away, Icarus gave a silent nod, his heart heavy with the weight of injustice. But for Ariadne, he would lay low. For now.\n\n \n\nHis resolve did not last long. Minos threw in the Labyrinth a little boy who stepped in front of him when the king was parading through the streets.\n\n \n\nIcarus stood at the entrance of the Labyrinth, his heart pounding in his chest. He had just returned from a hunt, his weapons still slick with the blood of his prey. But he wore no armor, his chest bare to the cool evening air.\n\n \n\nHis mind was filled with images of the Athenian youths and maidens, their faces pale and fearful as they were led to the beast's lair. He had seen them all, year after year, at Minos' gruesome Harvest Feast. Their screams still echoed in his ears, their terror a haunting memory.\n\n \n\nBut it wasn't just the Athenians who were fed to the Minotaur. Minos, in his cruelty, also threw his political opponents into the Labyrinth. Anyone who dared to gossip about the royal family, anyone who earned the king's ire, was condemned to the beast. Only days ago, a little boy of eight years had earned the king's ire. The child had stepped in front of Minos while the king walked through the streets to observe his kingdom. Minos took childish mischief as a challenge to his authority.\n\n \n\nIcarus felt a wave of nausea sweep over him. The injustice of it all was too much to bear. He knew of the prophecy, the one that foretold the Minotaur's death at the hands of a son of Poseidon. But Minos had ensured that no son of Poseidon would ever set foot in Crete.\n\n \n\nAnd yet, Icarus himself was a grandson of Poseidon through his mother, the naiad Neucrate. He looked down at his hands, the same hands that had slain countless beasts on his hunts. Could he be the one to end the Minotaur's reign of terror?\n\n \n\nWith a deep breath, Icarus stepped closer to the entrance of the Labyrinth, his resolve hardening. He would not stand by and let the innocent suffer any longer. He would face the beast, for the sake of those who could not defend themselves. And perhaps, just perhaps, he could bring an end to the tyranny of King Minos.\n\n \n\nWith a deep breath, Icarus reached out to push the door open, but was suddenly intercepted. An inhumanly strong hand gripped his arm, pulling him away from the entrance. He turned to see Hermes, the messenger of the gods, looking at him with a stern expression.\n\n \n\n\"Why are you stopping me, Hermes?\" Icarus demanded, his voice filled with frustration.\n\n \n\nHermes sighed, releasing his grip on Icarus' arm. \"It's on Apollo's behalf, Icarus,\" he explained.\n\n \n\n\"Only a child of Poseidon can kill the Minotaur. You are just a grandchild. If you try to face the Minotaur, you will die and leave Apollo heartbroken. Trust me on this, the world does not need his heartbreak.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus felt a lump in his throat. \"Am I supposed to endure this atrocity every year? Every day?\" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n \n\nHermes looked at him sympathetically. \"Icarus, there is nothing you can do. Throwing your life away will not help anyone. It will just hurt everyone that loves you. It will hurt Apollo, Daedalus, and Ariadne.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus was silent for a moment, taking in Hermes' words. He realized that Hermes was right. He couldn't risk his life on a prophecy that might not even apply to him. With a heavy heart, he nodded, thanking Hermes for his wisdom.\n\n \n\nWith that, Icarus turned away from the Labyrinth, his resolve to fight the Minotaur replaced with a new determination: to protect those he loved, even if it meant enduring the injustice of King Minos.\n\n \n\nLater, Hermes reported to Apollo. The messenger god idly held a crocus flower in his hands, twirling it. Hermes smiled sadly at the lovely flower. Seeing the Cretan boy was a shock. Icarus looked so much like the late Prince Hyacinthus. Seeing such a dead-ringer for his beloved Crocus' best friend brought the past back to Hermes. The loss of Crocus would always hurt, especially the knowledge that it was all his fault. He wondered if it was a case of rebirth, for just a coincidental resemblance. Given how obsessed his brother was with Icarus, Hermes suspected the first, but also he did not want to believe it. If Hyacinthus could rise from the dead to return to Apollo, why couldn't Crocus do the same? Why did his beloved still stay in Elysium? The one place where Hermes couldn't go.\n\n \n\n\"I stopped Icarus this time, but the boy is extremely upset about the devoured youths. If Minos feeds another small child to the Minotaur, Icarus might try again. That was what nearly made him break, a slaughtered child. Icarus is fond of small children.\"\n\n \n\nApollo realized what his favorite brother was getting at.\n\n \n\n\"If Icarus has a child of his own, he will be too busy to worry about the Minotaur and other people's children,\" he mused, recalling how much care a baby needed from when Asclepius was little.\n\n \n\nThis gave Apollo a new perspective and a potential solution to keep Icarus safe. Asclepius remained his favourite son, born of his greatest and truest love. Perhaps it was time for his beloved son to have a full sibling.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nPercy was taking a shower and wiping the salt from her skin when she heard her mother talking on the phone.\"I need to talk to her first! She is my daughter and needs to hear it from me!\" Sally was talking to someone.\n\n \n\nPercy quickly got out of the shower, wiped off the water, and dressed at record speed. Her mom was still talking on the phone.\n\n \n\n\"Give me one hour to explain to her. I know my daughter. She will have trouble believing this.\"\n\n \n\n\"I will have trouble believing what?\" Percy asked her mom.\n\n \n\nSally spun around to look at Percy and sighed.\n\n \n\n\"I have to go now. Give me one hour.\"\n\n \n\nPercy frowned.\n\n \n\n\"Mom? You are freaking me out. What is going on?\"\n\n \n\n\"Alright, Percy,\" Sally began, her voice steady despite the gravity of the story she was about to unfold. \"I suppose it's time you knew the whole truth.\"\n\n \n\nSally took a deep breath, her gaze drifting towards the horizon where the sun was beginning to set, casting a warm glow over the beach.\n\n \n\n\"After Uncle Rich passed away, I was left with nothing but debts and this cabin. I had no choice but to drop out of school and move here.\"\n\n \n\nPercy listened quietly, her eyes wide with curiosity and concern. She had heard bits and pieces of this story before, but never in such detail.\n\n \n\n\"I found a job at a local diner,\" Sally continued. \"It wasn't much, but it was enough to keep us afloat. Every day after my shift, I would come back to this cabin, our only sanctuary in the midst of all the chaos.\"\n\n \n\n\"One evening, as I was walking back from work, I saw a man on the beach. He was standing over an injured seal, and for a moment, I thought he intended to harm it. Fueled by fear and anger, I ran towards him, ready to protect the helpless creature.\"\n\n \n\n\"But as I got closer, I realized that the man was not a man at all. He was a god.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's eyes widened in surprise, her mouth opening to interrupt, but Sally raised a hand to stop her.\n\n \n\n\"I know it sounds crazy, Percy. But it's the truth. Your father...is a god.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's eyes widened.\n\n \n\n\"You mean that he looked like a god? People tell me that I look like a goddess all the time but I don't actually believe it.\"\"Well, he did. But he is an actual, genuine god.\"\n\n \n\nPercy gave her mom a look.\n\n \n\n\"Mom, did you eat or drink anything weird today?\"\n\n \n\nSally gave her daughter a look of muted disappointment.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, I know that it is difficult to believe but you must.\"\n\n \n\n\"I realized what your father was after I had practically tried to wrestle him away from the animal. I got lucky that he was charmed and impressed by my bravery instead of offended and angered by my audacity.\"\n\n \n\nSally gave a rueful smile.\n\n \n\n\"It can go either way with them.\"\n\n \n\nNow this sounded familiar to Percy.\n\n \n\n\"Mom, are you talking about Greek mythology? The really bipolar gods of legend?\"\n\n \n\n\"Yes, Percy,\" Sally nodded, her voice barely above a whisper.\"I'm talking about Greek mythology. The man I met that night was Poseidon, the god of the sea.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's eyes widened in disbelief, her mind racing to process the information.\n\n \n\n\"Poseidon? As in, trident-wielding, sea-controlling, earthquake-causing, horse-creating Poseidon?\"\n\n \n\nSally nodded again, reaching out to squeeze Percy's hand reassuringly. \"Yes, Percy. And he was charmed by my audacity, impressed by my bravery. He didn't smite me on the spot, which, as you pointed out, can go both ways with gods.\"\n\n \n\n\"But why would Poseidon be here, at Montauk beach?\" Percy asked, her voice filled with confusion and curiosity.\n\n \n\nSally sighed, her gaze drifting back to the horizon. \"That, Percy, is a story for another time. For now, just know this - you are special. You are the daughter of a god, and that means your life is about to get a lot more... interesting.\"\n\n \n\n\"Interesting how?\"\n\n \n\nSally opened her mouth to speak more but was interrupted by a loud bang at the door. She quickly moved let the person trying to bring down their door in.\n\n \n\nGrover Underwood stumbled into the Jackson cabin in Montauk, his eyes wide with terror. \"Sally,\" he gasped, \"there's a monster coming. We need to get Percy to camp. Now!\"\n\n \n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Sally Jackson ushered Percy and Grover into the car. As they sped towards the camp, the urgency was palpable. Percy, peering out of the window, felt her blood run cold as she recognized the monstrous figure pursuing them - the Minotaur.\n\n \n\nA wrathful hatred surged within her at the sight of the beast. \"That monster,\" she seethed, her fists clenched tightly. An amber-eyed presence within her stirring, loathing the very sight of the beast.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, a lightning bolt struck their car, causing it to swerve and crash. In the ensuing chaos, the Minotaur lunged at Sally, and with a swift, cruel motion, she vanished.\n\n \n\n\"No!\" Percy screamed, her heart pounding in her chest. Enraged, reached for the hairclip in her hair to draw her sword, but the Minotaur was quicker. With a swift swipe of its massive hand, it knocked the weapon out of her grasp.\n\n \n\nBut Percy was not defeated. With a roar of defiance, she launched herself at the Minotaur. She grappled with the beast, her hands finding purchase on one of its horns. With a mighty heave, she ripped it off and, without missing a beat, plunged it into the Minotaur.\n\n \n\nThe beast let out a final, agonizing roar before it collapsed, defeated. Panting heavily, Percy stood victorious, her heart pounding with adrenaline and grief.\n\n \n\nGrover managed to get up from where he'd been thrown. He gulped at the sight of Percy standing victorious, clutching the Minotaur's horn, not a scratch on her. The demigod he had befriended looked like she could slay nearly invincible monsters all day. He had not needed to go for the nuclear option to save her life.\n\n \n\n\"Oh, gods,\" he muttered, \"I was too hasty.\"\n\n \n\nWorrying for Percy's life, he had sent an urgent and fervent prayer to Apollo, claiming that Percy Jackson was the third incarnation of Hyacinthus. He immediately regretted it.\n\n \n\n\"Please, Apollo, don't listen,\" he whispered, but it was too late. Of course the sun god would be listening closely and eagerly for anything relating to Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\nApollo appeared before Percy in all his glory. Grover looked at him and saw not the softer, joyful god of the modern era. He saw who Apollo had been in Ancient Greece. He saw the god that had wrecked civilizations in his grief and rage when his beloved had perished. Apollo was looking at Percy as if she were the god and he the worshipping mortal.\n\n \n\nPercy tilted her head and gasped, \"Apollon.\" An ancient dialect dripping from her lips.\n\n \n\nShe dropped the Minotaur's horn and clutched her head in agony, falling to her knees and screaming in pain. As she let out a howl of grief, pain, and rage, the ground trembled, the tide rose high, and a storm formed. Grover flinched, the sheer depth and intensity of that maelstrom of emotion nearly knocking him over.\n\n \n\nApollo lifted Percy to her feet, but she passed out in his arms. Grover bleated in fear, realizing the magnitude of what he'd done. Before Hyacinthus had been the child of a Muse under Apollo's authority, or the child of a mortal who could not defy Apollo. But if Chiron's suspicions were correct, the father of Perseus Marina Jackson was the god Poseidon. Someone Apollo could not intimidate, suppress or threaten. Percy was a forbidden child, born against and oath and Zeus would want her dead. Grover did not know what that prophecy that had alarmed the Big Three into an oath said exactly, but he knew that the fate of the world now rested in Percy Jackson's hands.\n\nYes, I am evil.\n\nThe disc happens.\n\nApollo makes a suggestion to Icarus. Daedalus does not like his son's boyfriend.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nIn the lush gardens of Apollo's Delphic Palace, Prince Hyacinthus was slowly recovering from his traumatic encounter with Zephyrus. His lover, the sun god Apollo, was at his side, providing comfort and support, yet struggling to understand the depth of Hyacinthus' pain. Apollo was a god, eternal and unchanging; human emotion puzzled him, and he struggled to understand what Hyacithus was going through. He did his best to provide reassurance and be a loving presence.\n\n\"Why do you tremble so, my love?\" Apollo asked, his divine eyes filled with concern. \"I've examined you thoroughly. There's no poison in your veins, no curse upon your soul.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus sighed, his gaze distant.\n\"It's not a physical wound, Apollo,\" he explained.\n\n \n\n\"It's a wound of the mind, of the spirit. It's fear, it's violation, it's... trauma.\"\n\n \n\nApollo, being a god, found it hard to comprehend.\n\n \n\n\"But why? Zephyrus did not succeed in his vile intentions. And he has been punished.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus shook his head.\n\"It's not about what he did or didn't do. It's about what he tried to do, what he wanted to do. It's about the loss of safety, the shattering of trust.\"\n\n \n\n\"I was told about this from older warriors. There is a shock and horror that happens after the battle is over and might leave them reeling for a long time afterwards. Spending time in peaceful surroundings with loved ones helps\"\n\n \n\n\"This doesn't just happen after battle. Smilax told me of what happpened to her at camp. One of your fathers' son tried to violate her. She barely manage to escape and it left her shaking for a long while. She could not find peace. The next year she hatched a plan to send all of them after Medusa by tricking them with her powers. She cleared your brothers quarters and those of your nephews by Ares, since they had harmed her sisters.\"\n\n \n\nApollo was silent for a moment, then nodded.\n\n \n\n\"I see. I may not fully understand, but I will try. I will be here for you, Hyacinthus. Zephyrus will never come near you again.\"\n\n \n\nThe mention of Zephyrus brought back another painful memory. Hyacinthus looked towards the empty lake, only days ago filled with the graceful figures of his pet swans.\n\n \n\n\"He killed them, Apollo. My swans... your gift to me.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's face hardened. The beautiful birrds had brought his beloved much joy and delight. They had also protected him well.\n\n \n\n\"I know, and I swear by the River Styx, he will pay for it. I shot him with my arrows, laced with poison. Each arrow hit its mark, but the coward fled.\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus placed a comforting hand on Apollo's.\n\n \n\n\"I know you did, Apollo. And I know you'll bring him to justice. But for now, let's focus on healing, on recovering. We have each other, and that's what truly matters.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, they sat there, two lovers bound by love and shared pain, vowing to heal and to bring justice to the one who had caused them so much suffering. Apollo took up his lyre to play a soothing melody for Hyacinthus. The prince smiled, recognizing the song as one his mother had played for him often as a child. Hyacinthus at first humms along but with encourangement from Apollo he starts singing the verse.\n\n \n\nAs if summoned by her own composition, the muse Clio arrived, her face pale with terror.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus!\" she cried, rushing to embrace her beloved son.\n\n \n\n\"I heard the news. Are you alright?\"\n\n \n\n\"I'm... I'm okay, mother,\" Hyacinthus reassured her, though his voice trembled.\n\n \n\nClio turned to Apollo, her eyes blazing with godly wrath and maternal fury.\n\n \n\n\"You must make Zephyrus pay for this outrage, Apollo. He dared to harm my son, your lover, under your protection!\"\nApollo's face twisted with the wrath that everyone feared.\n\n \n\n\"I know, Clio. And I swear by the River Styx, he will pay for it. I shot him with my arrows, laced with poison. But the coward fled.\"\n\n \n\nClio shook her head in disbelief.\n\n \n\n\"I can't believe someone would dare to target someone under the protection of an Olympian known for his wrath. But for now, let's focus on healing, on recovering. We have each other, and that's what truly matters.\"\n\n \n\nClio moved to sit near her son, Apollo started playing the song again. Clio smiled.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus' favorite lullaby.\" The muse spoke.\n\n \n\nHyacinthus gazed whistfully at his mother.\n\n \n\n\"I remember. This as the song you taught me first after I had learned all the notes.\"\nThe prince then chuckled.\n\"Sometimes I would mess up on purpose so you would stay longer.\"\n\n \n\nClio laughed, tenderly caresing her child's curls.\n\n \n\n\"I know my darling. You were always a terrible liar.\"\n\n \n\nAfter a three-month vacation with his lover, the sun god Apollo, Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta returned home. However, the prince was not his usual self. He was a bit shaken, still recovering from a traumatic encounter with the wind god Zephyrus.\n\n \n\nKing Amyclas, Hyacinthus' father, and Crocus, the son of Poseidon and Hyacinthus' best friend, noticed the change. They saw Hyacinthus flinch at sudden movements, his eyes constantly scanning his surroundings. Concerned, they decided to confront him. Crocus in particular recognized the signs. His beloved late betrothed had similar symptoms after her first year in Chiron's camp. The son of Poseidon clenched his fists. Begging Smilax' forgiveness for breaking her privacy, he told King Amyclas his suspicions. Crocus hoped that he was wrong. He and the king could protect Hyacinthus from mortals, and they often had, the prince remaining unaware. But there was nothing they could do against a god.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus, my son,\" King Amyclas began, his voice filled with worry.\n\n \n\n\"You've been acting strange since you returned. Is... is Apollo treating you well?\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus looked surprised. \"Father, Apollo has been nothing but kind to me. He... he saved me.\"\n\n \n\nCrocus, ever the protective friend, asked, \"Saved you? From what, Hyacinthus?\"\n\n \n\nHyacinthus took a deep breath, then said, \"From Zephyrus. He... he tried to harm me. But Apollo protected me. He's been comforting and supporting me ever since.\"\n\"I was in Delphi. Hermes arrived to take Apollo to Olympus because the king of the god called for an emergency meeting. To kill time I went flying with my swan chariot. He.... He attacked. I was able to get away and seek refuge in Apollo's temple. Apollo immediately appeared and shot him multiple times with poison laced arrows. He fled but Apollo is looking for him to punish him further.\"\n\n \n\nKing Amyclas and Crocus exchanged a glance, relief and concern mingling in their eyes. It filled them with terror that a god would targed Hyacinthus in such a way when he was the beloved of one of the most powerful gods, but they were glad that Hyacinthus at least had avoided violation. They had not expected this, but they were glad that Apollo was there for Hyacinthus. And they knew they would be there for him too, as he healed from his ordeal.\n\n \n\nA year passed since Zephyrus attack. Apollo looked for signs of him every day from the sun chariot. He announced rewards for the West Wind's capture or for news of his whereabouts but he had no luck. Apollo decided to be patient. One day the winged pest would emerge and Apollo would be waiting.\n\n \n\nHyacintus recovered and the two lover could return to their former happiness. The taint Zephyus' actions left washing off each happy day.\n\n \n\nApollo, and his lover, Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta, decided to celebrate their fifth anniversary in the field where they first met. They chased each other through the tall grass, their laughter echoing through the air. Apollo materialized their favorite discus, a lovely creation of Hephaestus, featuring stunning a stunnin designs of the two of them in the sun chariot. Deciding to play with th discus, a game they enjoyed daily, they took turns throwing it back and forth. Hyacinthus caught it as it was thrown by his lover and happily threw it back at the god. Apollo caught it with a smile at his beloved.\n\n \n\n\"Your turn, Apollo!\" Hyacinthus called out, his purple eyes sparkling with joy.\n\n \n\nApollo laughed, catching the discus and preparing to throw it back.\n\n \n\n\"Catch it , Hyacinthus!\"\n\n \n\nBut today was different. Hidden in the foliage, Zephyrus, the west wind, watched them with envy. He seethed with rage and humiliation. He had been spurred by the beautiful prince at every turn. When he decided to just take his due as a god, Hyacinthus dared to fight and injure him. As if that was not enough, Apollo had appeared to defend the prince. The sun god had shot Zephyrus with seventy seven arrows. It had been agony to rip every and each accursed and poisoned arrow from his godly flesh. He had been gravely injured and in agony for months.\n\n \n\nWhile he hid, Apollo sought him mercilessly, looking to punish him. Imagine, punishing a god over a mortal. Now that he was healed, Zephyrus carefully snuck into Sparta. He was not just the god of the west wind, he also held sway over the domain of spring and vegetation. Not as much as when Persephone was Kore, but it was enough. Enough for him to hide from the ever watchfull eyes of the sun.\n\n \n\nEnraged at their love for each other, he blew at the discus that Apollo had just thrown, directing it straight at Hyacinthus' head. If Hyacinthus could not be Zephyrus, he would not be Apollo's. As perfect as Hyacinthus was, he had the one flaw that all mortals shared, mortality. The prince, as divine as he was, was still able to die and thus be forever separated from the sun god.\n\n \n\nHyacinthus fell to the ground, stunned and bleeding profusely. Apollo rushed to his side, screaming in grief. His divine melodic voice a howl of despair.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus! No, no, no...\"\n\n \n\nHe cradled his dying lover, desperately trying to heal him, pleading with the Fates to show mercy. But it was too late. Hyacinthus died in his arms. Everywhere the prince's blood wetted the earth, purple flowers began to bloom.\n\n \n\nApollo sobbed in utter agony, his cries piercing the silent field.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus... I... I'm so sorry...\"\nIn the distance, Zephyrus laughed in glee and fled, leaving Apollo alone with his grief. Apollo heard the West Wind, but he could not leave Hyacinthus' body to give chase. Devastated, he immediately teleported to Delos. His beloved needed to be tended too. It was the last grace he could give Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\nIn Delos, in his inner sanctum, a place where no one else could enter. There, while weeping, he tenderly prepared the body for preservation. He removed the bloody clothes, washed Hyacinthus, and using his powers, transformed the body into the hyacinth flower.\n\n \n\n\"I will keep you safe in death, my love. Forgive me for not being able to keep you safe in life. Forgive me for failing to secure you immortality. Please forgive me!\"\n\n \n\nApollo whispered, planting the flower in his inner sanctum, where it would be safe for all eternity. He knelt in front of what he had left of his love, golden tears flowing like rivers from his golden eyes. He bent to press a kiss upon the petals, his throat closing up with anguish as sobs wracked his body.\n\n \n\n\"You will always be with me, Hyacinthus. My beloved prince, my greatest love. I will love you all eternity.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIn the hallowed halls of Olympus, a cry of anguish echoed, a sound so raw and profound that it stilled the celestial sphere. It was Clio, the Muse of History, who had just received the tragic news of her son's demise. Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta, her beloved child, had been cruelly taken from her by the god Zephyrus.\n\n \n\nClio's howl of grief reverberated through the marbled corridors of Olympus, a maternal agony so deep that it shook the very foundations of the divine realm. She collapsed, her fists pounding the ground in a rhythm of despair, her screams piercing the eternal tranquility of the heavens.\n\n \n\nHer mother, Mnemosyne, and her sisters, the rest of the Muses, rushed to her side, their faces etched with concern and sorrow. They tried to console her, their words of comfort floating around her like a soft melody. But their attempts were in vain. Clio was inconsolable. Hyacinthus was not just her son; he was the embodiment of her love, her joy, her pride. He was the one person she truly loved, more than anything.\n\n \n\nAs she wept, a memory surfaced from the depths of her mind. Over twenty years ago, Aphrodite had cursed her, declaring that she would lose the one person she would truly love. Clio had thought it would be a man she would fall in love with, a lover who would steal her heart. She never imagined that the curse would aim at maternal love, that it would rob her of her precious child.\n\n \n\nWith this realization, a fresh wave of agony washed over her. Her grief turned into rage, a burning fury directed at Aphrodite.\n\n \n\n\"Curse you, Aphrodite!\" she screamed, her voice echoing through Olympus, \"You have taken my son, my heart. May you feel the pain you have inflicted upon me!\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, the halls of Olympus bore witness to a mother's grief, a testament to the love of Clio for her son, and a curse that would echo through the annals of history.\n\n \n\nFrom their loom, the Fates watched, a smirk playing on their lips. They decided to grant Clio her request. But Aphrodite only had a true attachment to her immortal children, Eros first among them. Still, even if Eros was unable to die, he could fall in love and become separated from his mother. Pleased, the Fates set the threads in motion for Eros and his mother to suffer a fallout that would haunt Aphrodite for eternity.\n\n \n\n\"Let it be so,\" they murmured, their voices a whisper in the wind,\n\"Aphrodite will know the pain of loss.\"\n\n \n\nClotho started pulling a new thread, a tender, multicolored one much like a butterfly's wings. She smiled.\n\n \n\n\"A princess, beautiful enough to steal Eros heart. Her beauty will be the envy of Aphrodite. Eros will be forced to chose. He will not chose his mother and Aphrodite shall despair. Everything she will try will backfire on her. With each trial she will lose one more piece of her son's love. And she will feel every bit of it.\"\n\n \n\n\"Apollo will get a chance to get back at Eros, but he will fail. Eros will have his eternal bride. It is Aphrodite who is being cursed after all.\"\n\n \n\n\"Sisters, you love tormenting Apollo.\"\n\n \n\n\"It will be all the sweeter when we finally bless him.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIn the verdant valleys of Lacedaemonia, under the watchful gaze of Mount Taygetus, the god Hermes found his lover, Crocus, son of Poseidon. Crocus, usually as vibrant as the summer seas, was a picture of desolation. His best friend, Prince Hyacinthus, had been cruelly taken from the world, murdered by the jealous west wind, Zephyrus.\n\n \n\nCrocus had just returned from the funeral rites of Hyacinthus. The ceremony had been a somber affair, made all the more poignant by the absence of a body. Apollo, in his grief, had transformed Hyacinthus into a flower, a beautiful bloom that would forever bear the name of the fallen prince.\n\n \n\nApollo himself had arrived at the end of the ceremonies, his golden eyes still wet with tears. In a voice that echoed with sorrow and love, he had commanded the Spartans to hold the Hyacinthia festival every year on the anniversary of Hyacinthus' death, to honor him for all eternity.\n\n \n\nCrocus was inconsolable. He had lost his betrothed, Smilax, years ago, and now Hyacinthus, his best friend, was gone too. His heart felt heavy in his chest, a weight that threatened to pull him under.\n\n \n\nHermes, the messenger of the gods, known for his eloquence, found himself at a loss for words. He held Crocus, letting him grieve, offering his silent presence as a balm for his lover's pain. He knew that words, no matter how sweet or comforting, could not fill the void left by Hyacinthus. All he could do was stay by Crocus' side, a steadfast presence in his time of sorrow.\n\n \n\nAnd so, under the shadow of Mount Taygetus, two hearts mourned. One, a mortal, grieving for a friend and a love lost. The other, a god, sharing in his lover's sorrow, a testament to the bonds that even the divine could not escape.\n\n \n\nThe two lovers were not allowed the respite of grieving together. A sarcastic clap echoed through the air. Aphrodite appeared, her eyes gleaming with cruel delight.\n\n \n\n\"Bravo, Crocus,\" she sneered. \"Falling in love with the murderer of your betrothed, Smilax.\"\n\n \n\nCrocus recoiled, his face pale. \"You lie, Aphrodite! It was you who killed Smilax!\"\n\n \n\nAphrodite laughed, a chilling sound.\n\n \n\n\"Oh, you poor, naive boy. It was not I, but the god of lies who spun that tale.\"\n\n \n\nCrocus turned to Hermes, his eyes wide with horror. \"Is this true, Hermes?\"\n\n \n\nHermes remained silent, his gaze averted. Crocus' heart shattered, his tears falling like rain.\n\n \n\n\"Everything was a lie,\" he whispered.\n\n \n\nAphrodite was not done. She bound Hermes with thorny vines, her eyes gleaming with vengeance.\n\n \n\n\"This is for framing me, Hermes,\" she hissed. And with a cruel smile, she threw a disc at Crocus, striking him dead instantly.\n\n \n\nHermes struggled against his bonds, his golden ichor flowing from the cuts the thorns made. Aphrodite laughed, her voice echoing through the mountains.\n\n \n\n\"Never wrong me again, Hermes.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, she disappeared, leaving Hermes alone with his grief. He finally freed himself and reached Crocus' lifeless body. His tears fell on Crocus, and in that moment, the first crocus flower bloomed from the body of his beloved.\nAnd so, the god of lies wept for his lover, his heart filled with regret and sorrow. The world around him bloomed with the vibrant colors of the crocus flower, a bitter reminder of his lost love.\n\nLater, a few bards would sing of their tale, and they would blame Hermes for the disc that struck Crocus dead. Aphrodite's last revenge. Hermes had framed her a murderer, and she would do the same. Crocus's father, Poseidon was most wroth, even though it was framed as an accident he was still angry at his divine nephew. He banned Hermes from the seas for three centuries. The god of the seas would have preferred eternity, but Zeus objected. Hermes could only suffer in silence. The only person who could help and understand, his brother Apollo, was busy with his own pain and grief.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIcarus:\n\n \n\nAs Icarus stepped into the grand mansion he shared with his father, Daedalus, the familiar scent of parchment and ink filled his nostrils. He made his way through the labyrinthine corridors, his heart pounding with anticipation. His father's workroom, a sanctuary of invention and creativity, was his destination.\n\n \n\nUpon entering, his eyes fell upon the goddess Circe, her radiant beauty illuminating the room.\n\n \n\n\"Lady Circe!\" he exclaimed, his voice echoing in the vast room. His delight was evident in his wide smile. His best friend, Princess Ariadne, held her aunt in high regard, and Icarus, in turn, had always been fond of Circe.\n\n \n\nHowever, his father, engrossed in his blueprints, seemed oblivious to the goddess's presence.\n\n \n\n\"Father,\" Icarus said, his tone firm yet respectful, \"Circe, a goddess, is sitting on a simple bench.\"\n\n \n\nWithout waiting for his father's response, Icarus turned to the maidservants.\n\n \n\n\"Bring food and wine,\" he ordered, his voice echoing authority. He then went to find a suitable chair for Circe. He found one, sturdy and comfortable, and covered it with one of his prized animal pelts before offering it to the sorceress.\n\n \n\n\"Circe,\" he said, extending the chair towards her, \"please, make yourself comfortable.\"\n\n \n\nCirce's eyes sparkled with delight.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" she said, her voice soft yet commanding, \"you have not lost the sweetness of boyhood now that you are sixteen. I am touched by your thoughtfulness.\"\n\n \n\nShe gladly took the chair Icarus offered her and partook in the refreshments, her laughter echoing through the room, a testament to the warmth and hospitality of Icarus, the young master of the mansion.\n\n \n\nAs they ate and drank, Icarus steering away from the wine as it was his habit, Circe regaled the youth with tales from her island. She had new apprentices, more nymphs had sought refuge with her. A pirate ship had attacked but Circe had swiftly dealt with them to keep her people safe. Icarus is glad to hear that the women under Circe's protection are safe.\n\n \n\n\"I must take my leave, Lady Circe,\" Icarus said after a while, \"Apollo awaits me.\"\nIcarus got up, gave a bow to the minor goddess and left at a run, eager to meet up with his beloved.\nAt the mention of Apollo, Daedalus looked up from his work, his eyes filled with concern.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" he said, his voice heavy with worry, \"I fear for you. Apollo's lovers often meet tragic ends.\"\n\n \n\nCirce, too, looked worried.\n\n \n\n\"Daedalus,\" she advised, \"it is not wise to anger Apollo. He is not a safe god to cross.\"\n\n \n\nA weary Daedalus nodded, sitting next to Circe and draining a goblet of wine. The room fell silent, the tension palpable. Yet, amidst the worry and fear, there was also a sense of hope - hope that Icarus, with his youthful charm and kindness, could perhaps change the course of his destiny.\n\n \n\n\"I had hoped that it would be a short dalliance,\" Daedalus confessed to Circe.\n\"Gods have brief affairs with mortals all the time and then leave. I prayed for it to be so. True, my Icarus would have been heartbroken. But he is young and youth recover quickly. Better heartbroken than dead and turned into an accursed plant!\"\n\n \n\nCirce took Daedalus' hand in hers, giving silent comfort.\n\n \n\n\"It has been a year. Apollo shows absolutely no sign of getting bored. In fact he seems to get more and more besotted with my boy every day!\"\n\n \n\n\"And Icarus is just as besotted and will not hear anything against Apollo.\"\n\n \n\nCirce signed.\n\n \n\n\"Love makes one unreasonable.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus made a face.\n\n \n\n\"It took an arrow from Eros for me to feel that fabled love. Dreadful. I turned into a fool! And it wore off right after Icarus was born. I cared for Naucrate after, she was my lawful wife and mother to my child, but I don't understand this love business.\"\n\n \n\nCirce gave him a rueful smile.\n\n \n\n\"You are fortunate then.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus gave the sorceress a look of curiosity. Circe seemed embarrassed for a moment, took a sip from her goblet and started talking.\n\n \n\n\"After Glaucus became a god, I became ennamoured with him. I tried to pursue him, but the wretch was intimidated by me. I was too ancient, too powerful, too crafty. He preferred to pursue some young, innocent young nymph.\"\n\n \n\n\"Scylla found him repulsive and wanted nothing to do with him. Glaucus, came to my palace and begged me for a love potion to use on the girl.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus listened, keeping his face carefully neutral. He was familiar with Scylla.\n\n \n\n\"I will admit I was jealous for a moment, but it passed. I looked at him and could not figure out what I ever saw in him. A weakling and a coward who could not endure a strong woman, and who sought to make an innocent nymph his by sorcery and deceit.\"\n\n \n\n\"Had I refused, he would have gone to a love god and they would have been all too eager to grant his wish. I decided to turn the girl into a monster instead. This way she is safe. Better to be transformed into a monster than to have your will usurped and your heart violated with false love.\"\n\n \n\n~~~\n\n \n\nThe moon was high in the sky as Daedalus, the master craftsman, left his workroom. His hands, stained with ink and dust, bore the signs of a long day spent in the service of his craft. He walked down the dimly lit corridor towards his bedroom, passing by his son's room. A grimace crossed his face. Usually, Icarus' lover, the sun god Apollo, spent the night there. Thankfully, Daedalus did not have to see the god too often.\n\n \n\nTonight was different.\n\n \n\nAs he passed by, the door creaked open and Apollo stood there, his golden hair shimmering in the moonlight. Daedalus could see his son, Icarus, sprawled on the bed, exhausted and debauched. He swallowed down his fatherly outrage, his eyes hardening.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" Daedalus greeted, his voice cold.\n\n \n\n\"Daedalus,\" Apollo nodded, his gaze serious.\n\n \n\n\"I am aware of your work with Queen Pasiphae. You are giving the Labyrinth consciousness.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus stiffened, \"And what of it?\"\n\n \n\nApollo's gaze hardened, \"You must not. If the Labyrinth becomes aware, it will turn malevolent.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus looked at his son, his body marked with love bites, and felt a surge of defiance.\n\n \n\n\"And why should I listen to you, Apollo?\"\n\n \n\nApollo simply looked at him, his golden eyes filled with a warning.\n\n \n\n\"Because if you don't, the consequences will be dire. I am the god of Prophecy.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, Daedalus simply bowed, a mocking smile on his lips, and walked away. Apollo watched him leave before shutting the door and returning to his lover. The night was still young, and the god had his own matters to attend to. The warning had been given. It was now up to Daedalus to heed it or ignore it. The fate of the Labyrinth hung in the balance.\n\n \n\nIcarus woke up, his body aching pleasantly from the previous night's activities. He was nestled in the arms of his lover, the sun god Apollo, their bodies entwined in the soft sheets. The morning light filtered through the window, casting a golden glow on Apollo's skin.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" Icarus murmured, his voice still heavy with sleep.\n\n \n\n\"Good morning, my love,\" Apollo replied, his fingers tracing lazy patterns on Icarus' back.\n\n \n\n\"Do you... do you want a child?\" Apollo asked, his voice hesitant.\n\n \n\nIcarus blinked, surprised. He had visited Miletus every time he went to check on his father's herds. The boy was a delight. Icarus always brought him a treat or a toy and played with him as he checked things over.\n\n \n\n\"I would love to, Apollo. But we... we are both men. We can't have children. Neither of us have wombs.\"\n\n \n\nApollo smiled, a mischievous glint in his eyes.\n\n \n\n\"There is a simple solution, Icarus.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus looked at him, puzzled. Before he could ask, Apollo snapped his fingers and they were suddenly in Delos, in Apollo's bedroom. Icarus looked around, stunned.\nWith another snap of Apollo's fingers, Icarus felt a strange sensation. He looked down at his naked body and gasped. He was a girl.\n\n \n\n\"I... I don't...\" Icarus stammered, too shocked to form a coherent sentence.\nApollo simply smiled, pulling Icarus closer.\n\n \n\n\"Trust me, my love,\" he whispered, leading Icarus to the bed.\n\n \n\nA few days later, Apollo confirmed that Icarus was expecting a child, a boy. Icarus' eyes filled with joy.\n\n \n\n\"I've always liked the name Alexios. From one of your titles, Alexicacus. Defender from evil.\" he said, his hand resting on his stomach.\n\n \n\nApollo smiled, kissing Icarus' forehead.\n\n \n\n\"Alexios it is then.\"\n\n \n\n\"But Apollo,\" Icarus said, his voice serious.\n\n \n\n\"The moment our child is born, I want to go back to my own body. I don't intend to do this again.\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded, understanding in his eyes.\n\n \n\n\"As you wish, Icarus. As you wish.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, under the golden light of Delos, a new chapter began in their love story. One that promised the joy of parenthood, the thrill of the unknown, and the enduring love between Icarus and Apollo.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nGrover Underwood, the satyr, was tasked with guiding Percy Jackson, a young girl with a destiny, towards the safety of the camp. The journey was fraught with danger, and the most formidable of them all, the Minotaur, attacked them. Sally Jackson, Percy's mother, disappeared amidst the chaos.\n\n \n\nPercy, with a courage that belied her age, fought the Minotaur. She ripped off its horn and, in a move that echoed the bravery of Theseus, stabbed it to death. Grover watched the battle unfold, his heart filled with dread. The Minotaur, after all, had only been defeated once before, and it was now an enforcer for Hades.\n\n \n\nIn his worry, Grover found himself praying to Apollo. He confessed his suspicions,\n\n \n\n\"Oh, Apollo, I fear Percy Jackson is the third reincarnation of Hyacinthus, your greatest love.\"\nAs if summoned by the prayer, Apollo appeared just as Percy stood victorious. Percy recognized him, and with a voice that echoed through the ages, she spoke his ancient name, \"Apollon!\" With that, she collapsed with a scream.\n\n \n\nHer emotional turmoil triggered an earthquake, a tsunami that Dionysus had to hold back, and a fierce storm that continued to batter the camp. Apollo, with a swift move, took the unconscious Percy in his arms and headed for the infirmary.\n\n \n\nGrover followed them, his hooves clicking against the ground. Apollo turned to him, his eyes blazing.\n\n \n\n\"You should have told me sooner, satyr,\" he said, his voice a low growl.\n\n \n\n\"I... I wasn't sure, Lord Apollo,\" Grover stammered, \"I didn't want to cause unnecessary alarm.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's glare softened, \"Let's just hope it's not too late.\" And with that, they continued their journey to the infirmary, the storm continuing to rage around them.\n\n \n\nGrover swallowed, gathering his courage.\n\n \n\n\"Was I right? Is she actually? Hyacinthus and Icarus were both male.\"\n\n \n\nApollo was whispering healing spells upon Percy but turned to once again glare at the satyr.\n\n \n\n\"Yes, the same soul. Just in a different shape.\"\nGrover's curiosity got the best of him.\n\n \n\n\"Don't you mind that she is a girl now?\"\n\n \n\nApollo's glowing golden eyes made the satyr step back, bleating in fear.\n\n \n\n\"Why are you satyrs so annoying?\"\n\n \n\n\"I don't mind at all! I am a god, not a bathroom to care about gender!\"\n\n \n\nAs Apollo carried the unconscious Percy towards the infirmary, Grover followed, his heart heavy with worry. They reached the big house where they were met by Chiron, the wise centaur, and Dionysus, the god of wine.\n\n \n\nDionysus looked at Percy and scowled, \"Another spawn of Poseidon. Just what we needed.\"\n\n \n\nApollo shot him a glare, \"Shut up, Dionysus. This is Hyacinthus, not just some random demigod.\"\n\n \n\nDionysus raised an eyebrow, \"Hyacinthus? But that's a girl.\"\n\n \n\nApollo sighed, \"Yes, I noticed. It's probably the Fates mocking me. I've been checking all the boys ever since I realized Hyacinthus was reborn.\"\n\n \n\nApollo smirked at his brother, \"You better inform Ariadne about this or your wife will be furious. She is still angry about the nymph. If you fail to tell her that her best friend is back she will eviscerate you.\"\n\n \n\nJust then, a trident sign lit up over Percy, claiming her as Poseidon's child. Dionysus cursed, \"Zeus will be furious. Poseidon broke the oath.\"\n\n \n\nApollo snorted, looking in the direction of the pine tree that was Thalia Grace.\n\n \n\n\"As if he didn't break the oath himself.\"\n\n \n\nApollo looked at the trident sign and then at the unconscious Percy in his arms. Despite the storm still raging andZeus's potential wraths, he couldn't help but feel a sense of hope. This was Hyacinthus, his greatest love, reborn. And he would do everything in his power to protect her.\n\nI made myself cry with the first part. That was hard to write, even though I knew.\n\nApollo grieves. Zephyrus seeks Eros.\n\nDaedalus discovers something upseting.\n\nPoseidon POV\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nIn the celestial realm of Olympus, a tale of love, loss, and revenge unfolded that threatened to disrupt the harmony among the gods. Apollo, the sun god, was on the brink of madness, his heart torn apart by the tragic death of his lover, Hyacinthus, the Crown Prince of Sparta.\n\n \n\nThe day was etched in Apollo's memory. He and Hyacinthus were engaged in a game of discus. In a cruel twist of fate, Zephyrus, the god of the west wind, driven by jealousy, blew the disc off course. It struck Hyacinthus, killing him instantly.\n\n \n\nApollo cradled Hyacinthus's lifeless body, his heart shattering.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus, my love,\" he cried, \"Why has fate dealt us such a cruel hand?\"\n\n \n\nBlinded by grief and rage, Apollo sought vengeance. He knew that Zephyrus was the perpetrator. As Hyacinthus bled out and died in Apollo's arms, the sun god heard the mocking laugher of the west wind. Unfortunately the sun god could not give chase. To do so it would mean abandon Hyacinthus' body to the mercy of the elements and wild beasts. Apollo tended to his beloved first. He took Hyacinthus to Delos, performed the rites himself, caring not for the pollution, and in his inner sanctum transformed him into a flower. Hyacinthus would be safe in death.\n\n \n\n\"Zephyrus!\" Apollo roared, \"You will pay for what you've done!\"\n\n \n\nIn his desperation, finally realising the magnitude of what he had done, Zephyrus sought the protection of Eros, who bore a vicious grudge against Apollo. Beset by the terror of facing the wrath of the sun god and seventh Olympian, Zephyrus decided to cast away his pride as a god. It was the only way he could hope to survive.\n\n \n\n\"Eros, I swear eternal fealty to you,\" Zephyrus pleaded, \"Save me from Apollo's wrath!\"\n\n \n\nEros, his red eyes gleaming with cruelty and his smile vicious, seized the opportunity, sought the protection of his Olympian parents, Aphrodite and Ares. Aphrodite, delighted by the prospect of having a god enslaved to her son, agreed. Ares, ever obedient to Aphrodite, complied.\n\n \n\nApollo was not without allies. Artemis, his sister, stood by him.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" Artemis said, \"We will find justice for Hyacinthus.\"\n\n \n\nHermes, the messenger of the gods, also supported Apollo.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" Hermes assured him, \"We stand with you.\"\n\n \n\nHowever, Zeus, fearing a war among the gods, intervened.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo, I will not allow this,\" Zeus commanded, \"You must not pursue Zephyrus. We cannot risk a war among us. Not for a mortal who would have died soon enough anyway.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, Apollo was left with his grief, his heart aching with the loss of his beloved Hyacinthus. However, Apollo was not willing to just capitulate to his father's demands.\n\n \n\nFurious, Apollo refused to raise the sun for months, almost dooming humanity.\n\n \n\n\"I will not raise the sun,\" Apollo declared, \"Not until justice is served.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis and Leto, Apollo's mother, were deeply concerned.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" Leto pleaded, \"You must raise the sun. Think of the humans. Think of Hyacinthus, who loved your sunrises and sunsets.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis added, \"Apollo, we must also consider Zeus. He might punish you.\"\n\n \n\nVery reluctantly, Apollo agreed, recalling how much his beloved Hyacinthus loved sunrises and sunsets. His beloved had always delighted in sunshine.\n\n \n\n\"For Hyacinthus,\" he murmured, \"I will raise the sun again.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, Apollo, though still grieving, raised the sun, his light a testament to his enduring love for Hyacinthus, a love that would forever haunt Apollo.\n\n \n\nBut the world was not the same. Apollo, the god of healing, plague, and music, was still grieving. Healers failed, diseases ravaged cities, and musicians wailed.\n\n \n\n\"The world grieves with me,\" Apollo whispered, \"For my greatest love is gone.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, Apollo, though still grieving, raised the sun, his light a testament to his enduring love for Hyacinthus, a love that, even in death, could never be extinguished. The world was forever changed because the sun god grieved his greatest love.\n\n \n\nSome time later, Hades visited Olympus. Apollo, desperate, approached him.\n\n \n\n\"Uncle, return Hyacinthus to me. Please.\"\n\n \n\nHades shook his head. Irritated that the god of rationality, reason and logic would even ask. Apollo knew the rules. There was no exception.\n\n \n\n\"I cannot break the rules, Apollo. If I make an exception for you, I will have to make it for every god who loses a mortal lover. My domain will be thrown into chaos. And you have caused me enough trouble with your grief.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, Apollo was left to mourn, his heart heavy with loss. The world was never the same, for it had felt the grief of a god.\n\n \n\nApollo then realized that Chloris, the goddess of flowers and wife of Zephyrus, was not protected by Eros and Aphrodite. Enraged, he decided to target her in revenge. Zephyrus had been fond enough of her to marry her and make her a goddess. Apollo was certain that he would be pained by her coming to harm. And it would humiliate Zephyrus to be unable to protect his wife, as it was his duty as a husband.\n\n \n\nChloris, terrified, sought Hera, begging to be released from her marriage. Apollo was relentless and would destroy her to get back at Zephyrus given half a chance. She had to separate herself from her husband. Chloris felt a surge of hatred for the dead prince. Had Hyacinthus not ensnared her husband's heart, Chloris would be safe, her status secure. Now she had to debase herself and beg mercy from Queen Hera. The goddess of marriage who regarded her with disdain and had called her a crass opportunist to her face many times.\n\n\"Queen Hera, please,\" Chloris pleaded on her knees, for Hera was her last hope.\n\n \n\n\"Zephyrus has betrayed me. He has abandoned me to suffer Apollo's wrath.\"\n\n \n\nHera, as much as she hated the dissolution of marriages, had to reluctantly agree. Also it would give her a good excuse to rid Olympus of an upjumped nymph who should have never been gifted godhood.\n\n \n\n\"Very well, Chloris. You are released from your marriage. But you must leave Olympus. You were given a place in Olympus because you were the wife of the West Wind. You are such no more and have no place here.\"\n\n \n\nChloris was devastated. She was cast away from bright, glorious Olympus and she could no longer go back home. She would need to find a way to survive in the mortal world. She found abandoned and forgotten sacred places of other, stronger nature gods and made them her own. She tried to establish ties with the Underworld again. She was cut of from her home, the Isles of Blest, but having options never hurt. Never again would she only rely on one thing or one person.\n\n \n\nIt irked Hera that Zephyrus the reason for all the trouble would not be prophecy punished. Hera could not go against what her husband had decided but she had her ways to get her way.\n\n \n\n\"I will grant you your divorce, Chloris. But know this, Zephyrus will not go unpunished.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, Hera turned her gaze to Iris, her faithful attendant. Iris was often the target of the male gods' advances due to her unmarried status. Hera saw an opportunity to solve two problems at once.\n\n \n\n\"Iris,\" Hera called, her voice echoing through the hall. \"Come forward.\"\n\n \n\nIris stepped forward, her eyes wide with surprise.\n\n \n\n\"Yes, my queen?\"\n\n \n\n\"I have decided,\" Hera announced, her voice ringing with authority, \"that you shall marry Zephyrus. This way, he will be under my domain again, and you will gain the status of a married goddess. Don't worry about Apollo. We will make it clear that Zephyrus has no choice in this, and he will not dare touch one of my attendants.\"\n\n \n\nIris looked at Hera, surprise etched on her face. But she nodded, accepting her queen's decree. \"As you wish, my queen.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, Hera, in her wisdom, managed to solve two problems at once. She granted Chloris her much-needed divorce and ensured Zephyrus was held accountable for his actions, all while protecting Iris from unwanted advances. Despite the circumstances, Hera couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Justice, after all, had been served.\n\n \n\nCut of from one last bit of revenge Apollo visited Delos more often, to grieve by the hyacinth flower. The flower was of unparalleled beauty, much like Hyacinthus had been. It shone and it released the most beguiling fragrance. It was also flush with Hyacithus' demigod essence.\n\n \n\nAs he had once declared to King Amyclas, Apollo would look for a method to produce children with Hyacinthus. Intuitively, Apollo knew that combining essences was key but actually doing it was the trick. A trick he could not quite unlock.\n\n \n\nHe finally got the an idea when his uncle Poseidon, now his undisputably favorite uncle, brought his son Anteros to Olympus for the first time. Anteros was not a young god. He was born even before Apollo took over the sun permanently. Anteros, god of mutual love, was born of Poseidon and his male consort, Nerites, the sole son of Nereus. Apollo recalled Nerites, the minor sea god had been very beautiful and very off limits since Poseidon was quite possessive of him, loving him above all others.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately Helios noticed and craved Nerites himself. Nerites, while spectacularly beautiful was not a powerful god. He was a very giften charioteer. His chariot often outrunning every other god at races. Even Apollo had lost to Nerites. Helios was foolhardy, and incited by both lust for Nerites beauty and envy for his chariot driving skills, transfigured the little sea god into a shellfish. Poseidon was devastated and furious. He was unable to transform Nerites back, so he sought revenge on Helios.\n\n \n\nIt was not the first time Helios had wronged Poseidon. One time, when the world was young, almost all gods and goddesses had gathered to claim all pieces of land. Helios had been absent and everything got taken. During that gathering, Poseidon and Aphrodite decided to have a tryst. A tryst that bore fruit. The sea goddess Rhodes rose from the sea, created by their union, and she brought up a new island with her. Helios, finally arriving, found out that no more pieces of lands remained for him to claim. He cast eyes on the new goddess and decided to claim her and her island as his own. Zeus urged Poseidon to accept, even when the sea god was reluctant to give up such a young child.\n\n \n\nAnd yet, mere centuries after the marriage, Helios cast Rhodes aside. He became enchanted with one of the older Oceanids, the dark and mysterious Perseis. He abandoned Rhodes, his lawful wife and set up a palace and a household with Perseis. The Oceanid called herself Helios' wife and gave birth to several children, as dark and mysterious as she was, Circe, Aeetes, Pasiphae, and Perses. Children that Zeus found alarming due to their sorcerous powers. Circe in particular, Zeus despised. He forced her to dwell on a single island and only leave for brief amounts of time to visit her family members.\n\n \n\nHelios did not stay loyal to Perseis. He had many other lovers, Clytie and Leucothea the most famous among them. But it was his desire for Nerites that was his doom. Poseidon was not a god to cross. Helios crossed him twice.\n\n \n\nHelios found raising the sun tiresome and often begged Apollo to do it for him. Apollo, finding the sun horses delightful and enjoying bringing light and warmth to the world was happy to do it. Poseidon noticed this. Eventually, the sun horses became more loyal to Apollo than to Helios and the domain of the sun started to merge with Apollo.Poseidon stuck. He seized Helios, tore the titan to pieces and cast him into Tartarus. By some stroke of fate, the portal that Poseidon used opened right over Chaos itself. Helios fell through, gone forever. Poseidon could never repeat the trick so perhaps it was fated. No one relished Helios' doom more than Poseidon's heir Triton, who had taken his sister's humiliation very personally.\n\n \n\nBut before Nerites's transformation, Poseidon produced a child with him despite both being male. As a game, Poseidon had tried mingling their essences and to their surprise Anteros was born of their love.\n\n \n\nApollo sought out his uncle, wanting more detail. Hoping he did not run to Anteros. The god of mutual love appeared to him as a copy of Hyacinthus, making his heart stutter with grief and longing. The other love gods also resembled Hyacinthus in his eyes but something was always wrong. Aphrodite was female, Eros had those cruel red eyes that did not belong on Hyacinthus' face. Anteros was an almost perfect copy. It hurt deeply to look at him.\n\n \n\nArmed with knowledge from his uncle he went back to the hyacinth flower. Combining the essences was now almost insultingly easy, but he would still need a womb to grow the child. Just snapping the child in existence would be unhealthy and likely to create defects and imperfections.\n\n \n\nApollo looked to the many lovers had taken to drown his grief. He chose men and women who bore any sort of resemblance to Hyacinthus. Princess Coronis was the closest in resemblance.\n\n \n\nWith a heavy heart, Apollo planted the embryo in Coronis' womb. The princess was overjoyed to find herself pregnant, dreaming of the glory and fame that being the mother of a demigod would bring. Little did she know, the child growing within her was not truly hers, but a living testament to the undying love between Apollo and Prince Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\nAs the child grew inside Coronis' womb, so did Apollo's hope. He saw in this child a chance to keep Hyacinthus' memory alive, a chance to turn his grief into something beautiful. And so, the sun god waited with bated breath for the birth of his child, a child born of sorrow, love, and a longing for the past. A child who would carry the essence of the late Prince Hyacinthus into the future.\n\n \n\nHowever, unknown to Apollo, another caught wind of his plans. Eros, the god of love and desire, had kept a close eye on Apollo since the death of Hyacinthus. Amused by Apollo's trickery, Eros shared the news with his newly acquired slave, the god Zephyrus, the one who had diverted Apollo's discus to strike Hyacinthus dead.\n\n \n\nZephyrus was infuriated. He had loved Hyacinthus, but the prince had spurned him at every turn, loving only Apollo. To save himself from Apollo's wrath, Zephyrus had sworn himself into eternal servitude to Eros. Yet, it was not enough protection. Every time Zephyrus dared to leave Eros' palace during the day, Apollo would spot him from his sun chariot. The sun god would use Zephyrus for target practice and set him on fire. Zephyrus was forced to carry out his duties during the night. During the day, he only dared to command the west wind from the safety of his master's lair. Zephyrus found it deeply unfair that Apollo would have a child of Hyacinthus when the sun god had the late prince's attention, love, and body.\n\n \n\nOne night, Zephyrus decided to visit Princess Coronis. He appeared before her, a figure shrouded in the darkness of the night. The princess clutched her bedsheet closer around her, feeling terrified and placing one protective hand over her large pregnant belly. Zephyrus's attention was drawn to her belly, where Hyacinthus' child grew.\n\n \n\n\"Princess Coronis,\" Zephyrus began, his voice a whisper in the wind, \"I have something to tell you.\"\n\n \n\nCoronis looked at him, her eyes wide with surprise. \"Who are you?\" she asked, her voice trembling.\n\n \n\n\"I am Zephyrus, the god of the west wind,\" he replied.\n\n \n\n\"And I have come to tell you a terrible truth that Apollo has kept hidden from you.\"\n\n \n\nCoronis listened as Zephyrus revealed Apollo's trickery. At first, she did not believe him. But Zephyrus swore on the Styx, the sacred river of the gods, that he was telling the truth. Coronis was left devastated and infuriated. She wanted to abort the child immediately, but Zephyrus told her that no abortive herb or tonic would work on a demigod, especially not one of Apollo's demigods. He suggested that she lay with another man. That might dislodge the interloper from her womb.\n\n \n\nWhile the princess pondered, Zephyrus left and had the wind whisper to Artemis that Princess Coronis was cheating on Apollo. Given how much Artemis loved her twin, she would definitely kill Coronis and Hyacinthus' unborn for this outrage.\n\n \n\nJust as Zephyrus expected, Artemis went to check on Princess Coronis and found her entangled with a former suitor, the mortal Ischys. Furious and outraged, Artemis shot multiple arrows at Coronis and her mortal lover.\n\n \n\nOne of Apollo's white ravens, who was assigned by Apollo to guard his child with Hyacinthus, immediately informed Apollo. An enraged and terrified Apollo accidentally turned all ravens black. He apparated to Coronis' corpse and immediately cut his son out of the surrogate princess's dead body. Thankfully, the child was still alive. Apollo tenderly cradled the bloody, crying infant, wrapping him up with a himation that had once belonged to his mortal father, Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\nArtemis arrived, and shocked she asked, \"Why are you preserving the son of a woman that was disloyal to you, brother?\"\n\n \n\nApollo, cradling his newborn son, glared at his sister and replied, \"This child is not Coronis', Artemis. He is born of the essence of Hyacinthus.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis was horrified that she almost killed her nephew, made of the essence of Apollo's greatest love. A good man who had loved Apollo alone and had been fiercely loyal to him.\n\n \n\n\"I... I didn't know, Apollo. I'm sorry.\"\n\n \n\nApollo forgave his sister but told her to check with him first if he ever finds one of his lovers cheating on him. \"Promise me, Artemis. Promise me you'll check with me first.\"\n\n \n\nGlad to be forgiven, Artemis agreed. \"I promise, Apollo. I promise.\" She forgot to mention that it was a whisper of wind that alerted her.Far away, a watching Zephyrus watched the infant. The boy had Apollo's golden hair, but the beautiful purple eyes of Hyacinthus. The sight of the child filled Zephyrus with a storm of emotions. Jealousy, envy, resentment, rage and just the slightest bit of longing. He knew that the birth of this child would forever change the dynamics of the celestial realms. And he, Zephyrus, would be there to witness it all.\n\n \n\n~~~~~\n\n \n\nIcarus:\n\n \n\nIn the sun-drenched island of Delos, Apollo, the sun god, and Icarus, transformed into a woman by Apollo's divine power, awaited the birth of their child. Icarus, despite the unusual circumstances, was in perfect health, and when their son Alexios was born, he was the picture of perfection - a miniature Apollo with Icarus' amber eyes and radiant smile.\n\n \n\n\"Oh, Apollo,\" Icarus cooed, cradling Alexios in his arms. \"He's perfect. He's just...perfect.\"\n\n \n\nApollo, watching them with a soft smile, nodded.\n\n \n\n\"He is, isn't he? A perfect blend of us both.\"\n\n \n\nWith a wave of his hand, Apollo turned Icarus back into his male form. Together, they returned to Knossos, their son in tow. Daedalus, Icarus' father, had been told by Apollo that Icarus would be away for a while. He hadn't expected it to be nine months.\n\n \n\nUpon their return, Icarus presented Alexios to Daedalus.\n\n \n\n\"Father,\" he said, \"meet your grandson, Alexios.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus was taken aback.\n\n \n\n\"A grandson? But how...?\"\n\n \n\nApollo stepped forward.\n\n \n\n\"I turned Icarus into a woman so we could have a child. He's as much Icarus' son as he is mine.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus frowned, not entirely pleased with Apollo's actions.\n\n \n\n\"You should have consulted me, Apollo. Icarus is my son.\"\n\n \n\n\"But look at him, Father,\" Icarus interjected, gesturing to the sleeping Alexios. \"Isn't he beautiful?\"\n\n \n\nDespite his initial shock and displeasure, Daedalus couldn't help but feel a surge of love for the tiny infant who proudly bore the eyes and smile of his beloved son\n\n \n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted, \"he is.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus frowned, glancing at his hands. He addressed Apollo.\n\n \n\n\"While I don't like that my son was turned into a daughter, I am glad that you did not just pop the child into existence like my mother does.\"\n\n \n\nApollo looked stoically at Daedalus, inviting the inventor to say more. Daedalus hesitated.\n\n \n\n\"While Icarus was away. I might have indulged in some esoteric artificing.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus clutched his son closer and glared at his father.\n\n \n\n\"Was that animus gadgetry again father?\"\n\n \n\nHe demanded, sounding vey displeased. Apollo could not help but feel surprised. Icarus loved his father dearly and held him in high regard.Daedalus looked vaguely embarrassed.\n\n \n\n\"It was because of something Lady Circe said. Some of my maternal half-sisters are her apprentices. She told me that they are extremely and unusually good at magics that involve disloging their own soul from the body.\"\n\n \n\nApollo realised immediately what the inventor was getting at it.\n\n \n\n\"Astral projection?\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus nodded.\n\n \n\n\"That is what Circe called it.\"\n\n \n\n\"We then started discussing creation of life without conception and gestation. Circe is of the belief that children created thus have a defect in their very soul.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus clutched the baby closer and gave a horrified stare at his father. As if to add to his horror, Apollo nodded and spoke.\n\n \n\n\"Essence mingling can replace traditional conception without trouble. But at least some gestation is key.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus gave a low, bitter chuckle.\"You are right my bright lord. My dear wise mother neither conceived me properly and neither did she gestate me. My soul is not properly rooted to my body.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus shook his head in denial.\n\n \n\n\"Father, why would you say that?\"\n\n \n\n\"I created a device, Icarus. A revealer of the animus, the soul. I checked myself and then many other people. My soul is barely attached to my mortal frame, no roots in it at all. Everyone else has a properly attached soul, but I don't. And if I had any maternal siblings here to test, they would be the same.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus turned to Apollo. His lover was starring into the distance, eyes blazing golden. Icarus looked up to see the sun. He was not surprised to see the sun pulse and slightly waver.\n\n \n\n\"Your father is correct.\" Apollo spoke.\n\n \n\n\"I just checked all of Athena's children at Chiron's training camp and the ones in Athens that I am aware of. They have the same issue as your father.\"\n\n \n\n\"Will father be able to enter the Underworld when the time comes?\" Icarus asked, horrified.\n\n \n\n\"It should not be an issue as long as all the rites are done right. And it might be a good idea to sacrifice to psychopomp so they are nearby to transfer your father safely. Otherwise he might be lost and next to impossible to find.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~Modern Era:\n\n \n\nPoseidon, the god of the sea, had just claimed his daughter, Percy Jackson. His heir, Triton, had advised him to wait, fearing that it would trigger Zeus's paranoia, which was already heightened due to the theft of his Master Bolt. But Poseidon couldn't wait any longer. Not claiming her would be even more dangerous than claiming her. This way people would know that Percy did not just have Apollo in her corner, but also her father, one of the Big Three.\n\n \n\nHe had watched as Percy made her way from Montauk to Camp Half-Blood, a journey fraught with danger. Not for the first time he cursed the ancient laws. During his watch, he discovered that Percy was the third reincarnation of Hyacinthus, Apollo's greatest love. This revelation shocked him, but it also filled him with a strange sense of pride. The first Hyacinthus was a descendant of King Lelex, Poseidon's son. The second incarnation Icarus was Poseidon's grandson by his naiad daughter Naucrate of Crete. Once again the only person to conquer Apollo's heart was born from Poseidon's bloodline.\n\n \n\nWhen Percy engaged the Minotaur in battle after Sally disappeared, Poseidon was not worried, recognizing the transport. Hades was honorable and would not harm Sally. Poseidon had no idea why his older brother was doing this but Hades delighted in being mysterious. Poseidon was starting to have a suspicion which he hoped was not true. Hades had been there when the Master Bolt had been stolen, but his brother was no more a thief than Poseidon was. There also been a high level of activity from underworld entities in the surface. Naiads and other river spirits had noticed and reported to him. Unfortunately, Poseidon could not talk to his brother and ask.\n\n \n\nThe satyr assigned to escort her to camp became unnecessarily alarmed and prayed to Apollo, revealing Percy's true identity. Apollo arrived immediately and took Percy to the Infirmary, while Dionysus was informed of who Percy truly was. Poseidon had to restrain his displeasure at his drunkard nephew disregard for his children.\n\n \n\nPoseidon immediately claimed Percy. He knew that once she woke up, she would need to be sorted into a cabin. Cabin eleven was overcrowded with hormonal teenage boys, and Percy, being a beautiful girl, would undoubtedly attract attention. He would not have his only demigod daughter in a cabin full horny little brats. Or Apollo might invite her into his cabin, Cabin seven, but that was an even worse option. Cabin Seven was for all intents and purposes Apollo's temple, he had full access and control of it. Percy was twelve, it was not going to happen.\n\n \n\nPoseidon decided to take matters into his own hands. He ensured that Percy would sleep in Cabin three, his own cabin, where he could control who could enter. He would protect his daughter, no matter what. After all, she was not just his daughter, but also the reincarnation of Hyacinthus, a fact that made her even more special. He looked forward to seeing her grow and thrive in Camp Half-Blood, under his watchful eye.\n\n \n\nTriton, however, was not pleased. He was not fond of the sun or the deity who controlled it. It had started when Helios had abandoned Rhodes thousands of years ago.\n\n \n\n\"Father,\" he said, \"yet another sun god is stealing a daughter of the sea. This is not right.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon nodded, understanding his son's frustration. \"I know, Triton. But Percy is not just any daughter. She might be the subject of the prophecy. I will do everything in my power to protect her but it might not be enough. I will need Apollo, and with Apollo comes Artemis. We need to stay the hands of the other Olympians who might decide that they can't risk her to live.\"\n\n \n\nTriton's face twisted into a sneer of hate.\"Your younger brother. And..and... her!\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon knew who Triton meant. Athena. The favored daughter of Zeus. Whom Triton had reared as his own under the sea. Only for her to repay him by killing his daughter Pallas. Poseidon had banished Athena from the seas for eternity but she found ways to be a nuisance. First with that city of fools and then with constantly causing trouble for his demigod sons.\n\n \n\n\"I will not let any of them harm Percy. And Apollo will help me.\"\n\n \n\nAnd with that, Poseidon turned his gaze back to Camp Half-Blood, watching over his daughter as she began her new life. He knew that the road ahead would be challenging, but he also knew that Percy was strong. She had defeated the Minotaur, just like her brother Theseus once had. And he had no doubt that she would overcome whatever obstacles came her way. Now, how to get Apollo to stay at least three feet away from her.\n\n \n\nWhen Poseidon saw William Solace up close he noticed the green eyes but did not think much of it. Plenty of people had green eyes. It was not until the boy correctly identified three shark species that Poseidon began to have a feeling about it. The little boy's smile was also the same as Percy's. But Poseidon had not wanted to believe it. Percy as barely four years older than little William. Hyacithus and Icarus had also been both male. Percy was not. Poseidon had made the mistake of dismissing the idea despite all the clues. The eyes, the smile, the love for the sea, the ability to swim for miles with dolphins coming to his aid. He should have realised sooner, Willam Solace was his daughter's son, his grandson.\n\n \n\nAs much as he needed Apollo, Poseidon could not help but feel a surge of rage, forcing him to send storms and tidal waves all over the planet in fury. How dare his nephew!\n\n \n\nWith that, Poseidon teleported to the Camp Half-Blood infirmary to talk to Apollo. Apollo was surprised to see Poseidon.\n\n \n\n\"Poseidon,\" he said, \"what brings you here?\"\n\n \n\nDionysus, who was also present, was very displeased.\n\n \n\n\"Poseidon,\" he said angrily, \"you broke the oath.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon reminded Dionysus that Zeus broke the oath first. After all, there once was a girl named Thalia who was transformed into Poseidon's sacred tree.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus broke the oath first, Dionysus,\" he said.\"And I will do whatever it takes to protect my daughter.\"\n\n \n\nApollo agreed with Poseidon.\n\n \n\n\"We will have to stop Zeus from harming Percy out of paranoia,\" Apollo said.\n\n \n\nDionysus wished them good luck. Zeus suspected that Poseidon ordered Percy to steal the bolt. Apollo said that was absurd.\n\n \n\n\"Percy could not have possibly sneaked into Olympus,\" the sun god said.\n\n \n\n\"She is too noticeable. Someone would have seen her and noted the resemblance to the statues of Hyacinthus and Icarus that line my palace.\"\n\n \n\nAnd with that, Poseidon knew that he had at least one ally in protecting his daughter.\n\n \n\nPoseidon could not help but glare at his golden nephew and then ask,\n\n \n\n\"Where is Will Solace? My grandson, you know.\"\n\n \n\nApollo winced at the sheer rage in Poseidon's voice and replied, \"Will is still asleep. When Percy had her breakdown that unleashed her power, I ensured that all the campers stayed asleep. We have to make sure Percy is all right first.\"\n\n \n\nDionysus snorted.\n\n \n\n\"You just put the brats to sleep and let me handle the tsunami!\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon chuckled.\n\n \n\n\"That was quite impressive for her first attempt.\"\n\n \n\nDionysus left the Infirmary in disgust, loudly lamenting not being able to even drink himself into a stupor. He cursed the day he had a romp with Zeus's favorite wood nymph. Apollo yelled after him, reminding him to tell Ariadne. Poseidon winced at the mention of the former Princess of Crete.\n\n \n\nChiron, the centaur who had taught Percy for three semesters, came in. Both gods were not happy with him. He had failed to inform either Poseidon or Apollo that Percy was Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\nChiron defended himself,\"I could not be sure and thought it wise not to bring too much attention to Percy. Both of you, Lord Apollo and Lord Poseidon have many enemies after all.\"\n\n \n\n\"Also, even non-enemies are terrified of a new instance of Hyacinthus. The first death caused more than a decade of trouble and unrest due to Apollo's grief, lessened only by Asclepius' birth. The second death caused the ancient Dark Age and the collapse of the Late Bronze Era. A lot of people are afraid that if this third one dies, it will be the end of times. Keeping it a secret seemed prudent.\"\n\n \n\nApollo thought back to the words of the satyr who had prayed to him\n\n \n\n\"So that was what the satyr meant with unnecessary alarm.\" he growled.\n\n \n\nChiron blinked.\n\n \n\n\"Grover was acting on my orders. During their stay at Yancy, both he and Percy became good friends. She will be upset if something happens to him.\"\n\n \n\nApollo glared at Chiron, golden eyed. His gaze turned much softer when he turned to look at Percy, who was sleeping peacefully and drooling slightly. He smiled fondly, that endearing little habit had stayed the same in three lifetimes.\n\nWanted to give an explanation on how Daedalus can escape death for 3000 years. He is not the first seeker of immortality, and not the first genius seeker of immortality. Something more is needed to transfer the soul into an automaton.\n\nApollo realises just how unfair life is and Clio's curse hits.\n\nIcarus and Nicodemos go on a quest.\n\nThe campers speculate.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nThe close call that his son had experienced terrified Apollo. He decided to keep and raise the baby in Delos, his sacred isle. There, under the watchful eyes of Apollo and his mother Leto, Asclepius grew, carrying within him the legacy of Hyacinthus. Apollo created the most beautiful nursery for his son. He commissioned from Hephaestus a cradle of the finest protective materials. Apollo himself pained murals of Hyacinthus in the nursery and placed pots of hyacinth blooms. Asclepius would know of his mortal parent. It delighted Apollo to compare his son to the likeness of his beloved. Asclepius was still too young for his features to be very clear, but he definitely had Hyacinthus' gorgeous purple eyes and his sweet smile. The baby was very cheerful and aways smiled and laughed with delight at the sight of Apollo.\n\nMeanwhile, in the bright Olympus, Hyacinthus's mother, the muse Clio, had become a recluse since her son's death. She carried out her duties as a muse perfunctorily and participated in mandatory celebrations. Otherwise, Clio stayed in her palace, which she had turned into a monument to her dead son.\n\nShe removed all of Hyacinthus's personal belongings from the royal palace of Sparta and recreated his rooms as a shrine to her dead child. The rest of her palace was lined with statues, tapestries, and murals of her son. The only flower she would allow to grow in her gardens and potted in her rooms was hyacinth blooms.\n\n \n\nAmong of the belongings that she had removed from the royal Spartan palace was the crown of Lelex, the founder of the kingdom of Laconia. Heirs were given the original crown after being officially recognized. It had been in Hyacinthus' keeping since her son had been fourteen years old. Clio would not have the sons of that horrid woman Diomede to have it. It would remain with her, a symbol of what her son should have had. Her beloved son, the greatest king who never was. The royal family of Sparta would have to establish another ritual to recognize the heir.\n\n \n\nHer sisters, the other muses, and their mother, Memnosyne, were worried, but Clio showed no sign of returning to her former self. Her grief was a testament to the enduring love she held for her son, mirroring Apollo's own sorrow. However, a spark of life returned to Clio when Apollo informed her that he had created a child with the essence of Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\nClio decided to visit her grandson in Delos. Upon seeing Asclepius, she was enchanted by the baby. She whispered to him, \"You have your mortal father's eyes, Asclepius. And something more... you have a touch of my Hyacinthus.\"\n\n \n\nClio visited regularly but not too often. It pained her to see the little boy grow up, so similar and yet so different to her beloved son. Asclepius was always glad to see her, often bringing her flowers and healing herbs. Clio accepted his offerings gracefully. She always had tales to tell him of his mortal father. Much like she had with Hyacinthus, she taught her grandson the lyre and all of the lullabies she had composed for her son. Even if the foolish mortals insisted on calling Asclepius the son of Princess Coronis, Clio would ensure that he knew of his real mortal parent.\n\n \n\nApollo, hoping to secure his son's future, approached Zeus with a request.\n\n \n\n\"Father,\" he pleaded, \"recognize Asclepius as the son of Hyacinthus, and thus the rightful heir to the throne of Sparta.\"\n\n \n\nZeus, however, declined.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" he said, \"Asclepius's birth came more than a decade after the death of Hyacinthus. Besides, he was gestated by a princess in a kingdom far away from Sparta. The mortals will not understand the method used to create Asclepius and it will cause too much disruption and confusion. It is tidier for Amyclas' throne to go to one of his other sons.\"\n\n \n\nApollo was infuriated that his son was being robbed of his birthright but was unable to do anything. Only Zeus could award kingship. If Asclepius ever wanted Sparta, he would have to conquer it. Apollo could see hints of his son's future. Asclepius would be the best healer to ever exist, even better than Apollo. If Asclepius had not been the son of his beloved Hyacinthus, that would have offended Apollo immensely. But since Asclepius was Hyacinthus', he couldn't help but feel pride. Only his beloved could give Apollo such a perfect son.\n\n \n\nWhen not tending to his little son, Apollo tried to keep up with what was happening in the world and in Olympus. Lately, mortals had started worshipping a very beautiful mortal Princess named Psyche in place of Aphrodite. Aphrodite was, of course, furious. Apollo barely paid attention to the nonsense. This had happened before and would happen again. Some foolish woman claimed herself more beautiful than Aphrodite. Aphrodite took wroth and ruined the woman's life. The gods had been entertained by such spectacles ever since Aphrodite had been enthroned in Olympus. It happened at least once every century. And yet, with each repetition, Aphrodite seemed to get angrier and angrier. This was the angriest Apollo recalled her being. The sun god raised his eyebrows when he saw the goddess of love pass by his palace, practically glowing with rage.\n\n \n\nApollo was vaguely surprised when Princess Psyche's father went to the Pythia, the Oracle of Delphi to inquire about his daughter's lack of marriage proposals. The Pythia told the king that Princess Psyche would marry a winged monster that even the gods feared. That put Apollo on alert. Eros fit that description. He decided to observe for now. If he saw Eros near Psyche he would act. After Daphne, Apollo might have been willing to let Eros be, but Eros went too far when he decided to shelter Zephyrus from Apollo's wrath.\n\n \n\n\"My son,\" Apollo whispered to the sleeping toddler, \"you are the last piece of Hyacinthus that remains in this world. I might get a chance to avenge your father. \"\n\n \n\nApollo watched as Psyche was left on the edge of a cliff by the macabre procession more fit for a funeral than a wedding party. She was dressed in a theatrical black peplos and clutching a bouquet of black flowers. Hyacinthus would have made a comment on how very dramatic that was. Then, she disappeared from his sight. He heard the rush of air and knew that Psyche was gone. It very much sounded like the work of a wind god. Apollo narrowed his eyes.\n\n \n\nFrustrated but determined, Apollo vowed, \"I will find her again. I am the god of light, and I see all that the light touches. I will keep my eyes on Psyche and observe her every moment she is near light. One of them will slip up eventually.\"\n\n \n\nAs days turned into weeks, Apollo observed Psyche's life unfold. She seemed happy with her invisible husband who visited her only at night. Her husband was attentive and generous, and Psyche glowed with happiness in the morning.\n\n \n\nBut as the day grew long, she tended to get lonely and quite bored. Apollo heard her talking to her invisible servants, mentioning her sisters and how she missed them despite their past cruelties.\n\n \n\nApollo saw an opportunity. He whispered into Psyche's ear, inspiring her to ask her husband to invite her sisters for a visit. Eros was hesitant at first, but eventually relented when he learned that Psyche was pregnant and needed the advice of her married sisters.\n\n \n\n\"Very well,\" Eros agreed, his voice soft in the darkness.\n\n \n\n\"I will bring your sisters here. But be careful, Psyche. They may not have your best interests at heart.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, Apollo's plan was set in motion. He would use Psyche's sisters to sow discord and doubt, hoping to drive a wedge between Eros and Psyche. His revenge was within reach, and he would stop at nothing to make Eros pay for his transgressions.\n\n \n\nIn the heart of the sky, nestled among the clouds, was a floating palace of unparalleled beauty. It was here that Psyche, radiant and expectant, resided with her mysterious husband. One day, her sisters, driven by envy and spite, came to visit.\n\n \n\n\"Psyche, dear sister,\" began the eldest, her eyes greedily taking in the opulence of the palace.\n\n \n\n\"Your home is truly magnificent. But tell us, where is your husband?\"\n\n \n\nPsyche, her hand instinctively moving to her slightly rounded belly, replied, \"He is away on business. He leaves the palace at dawn and returns at dusk.\"\n\n \n\nThe sisters exchanged glances before the younger one spoke, her voice dripping with false concern.\n\n \n\n\"But Psyche, how can you be sure of his intentions? You've never seen his face, have you? What if he's a monster who plans to devour your child?\"\n\n \n\nPsyche, taken aback, stammered, \"No...no, that's not possible. He's kind and gentle. He would never...\"\n\n \n\n\"But how can you be sure, Psyche?\" interrupted the eldest sister, her voice cold and calculating.\n\n \n\n\"You must protect your child. Demand to see his face. If he refuses, then you'll know he has something to hide.\"\n\n \n\nPsyche, her heart heavy with doubt and fear, nodded slowly.\n\n \n\n\"You're right. I must think of my child first.\"\n\n \n\nThey eagerly sowed doubts and anxieties in Psyche, not helped by the pregnancy hormones. Psyche almost became hysterical when one of the harpies mentioned that maybe her husband meant to devour the child when born. The sisters left, but they had served their purpose. Apollo was almost impressed by their viciousness. He did not even have to influence them. They were delighted to ruin their own sister's life all on their own.\n\n \n\nAnd so, as dusk fell, Psyche hid a lamp and a flintstone under her bed. She intended to lay awake and then light the lamp once her husband woke up. This way she would know what she had wed. When her husband arrived, he sensed her unease.\n\n \n\n\"Is it the child?\" he asked, his voice filled with concern.\n\n \n\nCarrying a child had taken a toll on Psyche. She became overcome by emotion easier. Grew tired easily, had aches and pains. She would have found very difficult to manage without the winged servants.\n\n \n\n\"Yes,\" Psyche lied, her heart heavy with guilt. Once he was asleep, she lit the lamp, revealing her husband's true form. He was not a monster, but the god Eros, beautiful and winged.\n\n \n\nHer gasp of delight woke him, but their reunion was cut short by the arrival of Apollo, the god of the sun and light. Psyche flinched at the god's visage. Apollo as he appeared to her was nothing like the smiling youth depicted in the statues of the temples she had visited. Apollo's skin seemed to shine with a harsh light, like the sun during a merciless drought, his mouth was set on a tight line, his golden eyes glowed a deadly gold.\n\n \n\n\"This is for Hyacinthus,\" he declared, his usually melodious voice a serpentine hiss, drawing his bow. He took aim at Psyche, hatred in his eyes, and a sadistic eagerness to cause his despised enemy the same pain that had been inflicted on the sun god.\n\n \n\nPsyche, terrified, closed her eyes, expecting the end. But Eros, for once loving something more than himself, shielded her from Apollo's arrows.The god of love jumped in front of his pregnant wife, allowing each arrow to hit him rather than the fragile and mortal Psyche. More arrows than Psyche could count pierced his flesh, golden ichor flowing to the floor. Unlike Psyche, Eros could not die. He could take the sun god's wrath.\n\n \n\n\"Zephyrus, take her to safety!\" he snarled a harsh command, desperately tackling Apollo. Trying to stop the sun god from taking aim again.\n\n \n\n\"You will not stop me from avenging my beloved, you winged monster!\" Snarled the sun god, trying to get an opening and strike at the mortal woman.\n\n \n\nThe west wind obeyed his master, whisking Psyche away to a riverbank where she encountered Ares, the god of war. He sneered at Psyche, deeply displeased. Despite his disdain for Psyche, he had to protect his son. With a sneer, he grabbed Zephyrus, and together, they returned to aid Eros. All three would be needed to keep Apollo occupied.\n\n \n\nPsyche, now alone by the riverbank, could only pray for her husband's safety and the future of their child. She was almost tempted to jump into the treacherous waters out of guilt. It was her doubts and insecurities that caused this. Her husband had been injured and was now fighting an Olympian son of Zeus.\n\n \n\nPsyche, now alone by the riverbank, was tempted to jump. But then, the god Pan arrived, drawn by her sobs. \"Death is too final,\" he advised, \"If you are wronged, seek revenge. If it is due to love, pray to Aphrodite.\"\n\n \n\nPsyche realized Pan was right. She returned home to her sisters and told them that her husband was Eros, who had fallen in love with them. She instructed them to jump off the cliff where she was originally left, promising that Zephyrus would catch them and deliver them to Eros. Blinded by vanity, the sisters believed Psyche's lies and jumped to their deaths.\n\n \n\nWith her revenge complete, Psyche knew she needed Aphrodite's acceptance as Eros' wife. Only then could they both be together in Olympus, safe from Apollo's wrath.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~As Zephyrus whisked Psyche away, Eros turned to face Apollo. He tackled Apollo, but Apollo easily overpowered him. Apollo began viciously beating Eros with his bow, stabbing him with more arrows. Eros cried out in pain, but Apollo was relentless. His lips twisted into a sadistic parody of a smile. Finally he had the vile pest exactly where he wanted him, broken and bleeding at his feet. Apollo was certain that his ill luck in love was caused by Eros. That made Eros nearly as responsible for Hyacinthus' death as Zephyrus.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, the fight was interrupted by the arrival of Ares, the god of war. Apollo's half brother was in full armour, clutching his prized spear. His eyes bulged with outrage at the sight of his son and he snarled with fury.\n\n \n\n\"Enough, Apollo!\"\n\n \n\n\"You will not harm my son over a mortal!\"\n\n \n\nAres roared, jumping to his son's defense. He engaged Apollo, giving Zephyrus the chance to remove the arrows piercing Eros' flesh. The wind god also gave his master a few large pieces of ambrosia to eat to speed up recovery.\n\n \n\nThe battle raged on, the gods clashing in a display of power and wrath. Apollo's vengeance was within reach, but the intervention of Ares had complicated things. The outcome of this divine conflict was yet to be seen. The battle between the two Olympians might have raged for half an eternity.\n\n \n\nThe battle between Apollo and Ares was fierce and brutal, their divine powers clashing in a spectacle of wrath and vengeance. Suddenly, the sky darkened, and a thunderous voice echoed through the heavens.\n\n \n\n\"Enough!\" roared Zeus, his thunderous voice shaking the very foundations of Mount Olympus.\n\n \n\n\"I will not tolerate my sons fighting each other over mere mortals!\"\n\n \n\nApollo, his golden hair matted with sweat and dust, turned to face his father.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus was not a mere mortal!\" he retorted, his voice filled with pain and anger.\n\n \n\nAres, still shielding Eros, yelled back, \"And I am fighting to protect my godly son, not some mortal! Who cares for the stupid girl!\"\n\n \n\nZeus brandished his bolt, its crackling energy illuminating the darkened sky.\n\n \n\n\"Enough!\" he repeated, his voice echoing with finality. Apollo and Ares, despite their anger, obeyed their father's command.\n\n \n\nZeus then turned his gaze to Eros, who was still pale and trembling with pain while tended by Zephyrus.\n\n \n\n\"Psyche,\" he declared, \"will undergo Trials assigned by Aphrodite. Only then will we determine if she is worthy to be a god's wife.\"\n\n \n\nApollo, still seething with anger, turned to Zeus.\n\n \n\n\"Why was I denied such a chance for Hyacinthus?\" he demanded, his voice filled with bitterness and pain.\n\n \n\nZeus looked at his son, his eyes filled with a mixture of sympathy and sternness.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" he said, \"the domain of marriage is held by Hera, not me.\"\n\n \n\nAs Zeus' words echoed through the heavens, the gods fell silent, each lost in their own thoughts. The outcome of Psyche's trials was yet to be seen, and the tension between Apollo and Eros was far from over. The gods of Olympus, once again, were on the brink of a divine conflict.\n\n \n\nZeus forcibly took Apollo, Ares, Eros, and Zephyrus to Olympus, where they were to stay until the trials were over. Zephyrus fled swiftly, hiding in Eros' palace, eager to get away from Apollo.\n\n \n\nUpon their arrival, Aphrodite was furious at the state of her beloved son. She wept at the sight of the dreadful wounds on his beautiful skin.\n\n \n\n\"I will destroy Psyche with impossible trials,\" she vowed.\n\n \n\nEros objected loudly.\n\n \n\n\"Mother, I love Psyche. You need to accept her as your daughter-in-law.\"\n\n \n\nAphrodite screamed, \"Never!\"\n\n \n\nApollo smirked, knowing that Psyche would likely die without him having to lift a finger. For once Aphrodite would be useful. The stage was set for a clash of divine wills, with the fate of a mortal hanging in the balance. He settled to watch the trials with relish, eagerly waiting for the girl to die so he could savor Eros' heartbreak. He ensure that part of his consciousness was in Delos, with Asclepius. To his surprise, Clio left her palace to observe the trials of Psyche. The Muse's attention was not on the mortal girl, but on Aphrodite. Clio closely watched the loud quarels between Aphrodite and her son with a strange smile that turned into a smirk everytime Eros declared how much he hated his mother.\n\n \n\nApollo settled to watch. The Trials Aphrodite chose were tasks a lady would assign a maidservant. Sort her grain, fetch her wool, get her beauty cream. Aphrodite hand imprisoned Eros in her own palace, justifying that her son needed to recover from his wounds. But the pest managed to get loose. He somehow convinced Demeter and even Hera to help his wife. Demeter send an army of ants to help Psyche sort the barrels of grains, barley, wheat, beans, and poppy seeds. Aphrodite was in watch for divine helpers, especially Eros himself, Eros' slave Zephyrus or Ares, who had inadvertently helped Psyche by battling Apollo.\n\n \n\nThe vain goddess missed the humble ants, just as Demeter had predicted given by her smug smirk when Psyche passed the test. Apollo protested, but Zeus declared it valid, much to his rage. Zeus justified that to obtain Demeter's favor, Psyche must have done her a great service at some point. Maybe cleaned a disused temple of Demeter perhaps. Apollo seethed at the utter unfairness of it all.\n\n \n\nBut it was not the end. For her second trial, Psyche had to gather the golden wool of carnivorous sheep. Apollo laughed as the girl despaired and but someone, and Apollo suspected Hera given how the queen smiled, told her how to get around the test. The sheep liked to eat blackberries and their wool often got caught in the thorns. Psyche only had to wait for the sheep to vacate the blackberry field and gather the wool trapped in thorns. At least she cut up her fingers bloody with that. Apollo recalled a few times when Hyacinthus had picked blackberries for the two of them to eat. His beloved prince had been precise and delf, never had his fingers bled from the thorns. Apollo remembered how Hyacinthus would feed him blackberries as Apollo laid with his head on his beloved's lap.\n\n \n\nZeus once again declared the trial passed and Apollo gave a snort of disbelief, sipping honey wine, and craving some blackberries. He already knew that even the ones grown from Demeter herself would not be as tasty as the ones Hyacinthus had given him.\n\n \n\nApollo had hopes fo the third trial. Psyche had to go to the underworld to fetch Persephone's beauty cream. He excused himself from the throne room and went to his palace. There he used one of the fountains to scry for Persephone in the underworld. Hopefully she would be in her gardens and not in her husband's palace. There Apollo could not reach. He could not see into Elysium either.\n\n \n\nIn the golden palace of Apollo, the sun god brooded. His golden eyes were stormy with anger as he thought of Psyche, the mortal woman who had passed her first two trials. His heart seethed with resentment towards Eros, the god of love, for sheltering the murderer of his beloved, Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta.\n\n \n\nWith a heavy sigh, Apollo approached one of the many fountains in his palace. The water shimmered with divine magic, serving as a portal to the underworld. He called out, and the image of Persephone, Queen of the Underworld, appeared on the water's surface.\n\n \n\n\"Persephone,\" Apollo began, his voice echoing in the grand hall.\n\n \n\n\"I have a request.\"\n\n \n\nPersephone raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued.\n\n \n\n\"What makes the sun god contact my dark realm?\"\n\n \n\n\"I need you to fill the box that Psyche will bring with Stygian Sleep instead of the beauty cream Aphrodite demands,\" Apollo said, his voice firm.\n\n \n\nPersephone hesitated, her expression turning thoughtful.\n\n \n\n\"Why should I help you sabotage Psyche's trials?\"\n\n \n\nApollo leaned closer to the fountain, his golden eyes reflecting in the water.\n\n \n\n\"Remember, Persephone, it was Eros who struck Hades with an arrow, inflaming him with love for you. Those love arrows are temporary. You were fortunate that Hades fell in love with you for real, or things could have turned very dicey for you. Imagine being trapped in the underworld as an unloved, unwanted quen, with no allies.\"\n\n \n\nPersephone's expression hardened at the mention of her past. She remembered the chaos that Eros' arrow had caused, the turmoil it had brought into her life.\n\n \n\n\"And let's not forget Adonis,\" Apollo added, his voice a low growl.\n\n \n\n\"I do not know for certain if Eros had something to do with his fate, but it would not surprise me. He always seems to have a hand in love tragedies.\"\n\n \n\nPersephone was silent for a moment, her gaze distant. Then, she nodded slowly.\n\n \n\n\"Very well, Apollo. I will do as you ask. But remember, every action has its consequences.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, the image of Persephone faded from the fountain, leaving Apollo alone in his golden palace, a grim smile on his face.\n\n \n\nA satisfied smile spread across Apollo's face as he went back to the throne room. If Psyche brought Aphrodite Stygian sleep instead of the beauty cream the goddess had demanded, the trial would have failed, even Zeus could not declare it otherwise. And if the girl made the foolish mistake of opening the box, Apollo would have his revenge sooner. He would see Eros suffer like him. And perhaps, it would inspire Eros to give up on his protection of Zephyrus.\n\n \n\nAs Apollo predicted, Psyche opened the box and fell into a deathlike state, each breath and heartbeat getting steadily weaker. But Eros, desperate to save his beloved, struck a bargain with Zeus.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus,\" Eros pleaded, \"I will promise you many beautiful women. Please, give me the Chalice of the gods to turn Psyche into a goddess and save her life and that of our unborn child.\"\n\n \n\nZeus, moved by Eros' offer, handed him the Chalice. Eros took it and flew off. Zeus moved to block Apollo from pursuing. Stewing, Apollo stayed put in his throne, his rage raising the temperature in the area to hights that would have vaporized mortals in an instant. Eventually Zeus let them leave so they could watch the couple return.\n\n \n\nEros brought Psyche to Olympus as a goddess. Aphrodite wailed in rage and despair. She fell to her knees, weeping and beating the ground in utter desolation. Eros ignored her coldly and escorted his wife into his palace. Apollo seethed but to his surprise, Clio, the muse of History and the mother of his lost beloved Hyacinthus, was pleased.\n\n \n\n\"Clio,\" Apollo turned to her, \"why are you pleased?\"\n\n \n\nClio looked at Aphrodite, her voice calm and steady, \"She has lost her most beloved son. Eros will never again love his mother Aphrodite like he did before. If al all. Eros will not forgive her for this. Their relationship is forever tarnished and destroyed.\"\n\n \n\n\"Aphrodite's curse cost me my son. But now my curse has cost Aphrodite's hers. At least I have the small consolation that my son never chose another woman over me.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIcarus:\n\n \n\nPrincess Ariadne, her heart fluttering with anticipation, hurried to the mansion of her best friend, Icarus. He had been away for many months, taken to Delos by his lover, the sun god Apollo. A messenger had brought word of his return and a promise of a big surprise.\n\n \n\nUpon entering the mansion, Ariadne was met with an astonishing sight. In Icarus' arms was a blonde baby boy, his amber eyes sparkling with innocence.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus, is this...?\" Ariadne's voice trailed off, her eyes wide with surprise.\n\n \n\n\"Yes, Ariadne,\" Icarus replied, a proud smile on his face. \"Meet my son, Alexios.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne was stunned. \"But how...?\"\n\n \n\nIcarus chuckled, \"Apollo briefly turned me into a woman so we could have a child that had both our blood.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne was taken aback by the casualness of his confession, but her attention was soon drawn back to the beautiful baby. As she cooed over Alexios, Daedalus, Icarus' father, entered the room.\n\n \n\n\"Ah, Ariadne, it's good to see you,\" Daedalus greeted her, a box of toys in his hands. He briefly held Alexios, a soft smile on his face, before excusing himself to his workroom.\n\n \n\nLeft alone with Icarus and the baby, Ariadne couldn't help but express her disbelief. \"I can't believe you had a child before I did, Icarus.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus winced at her words. The shadow of the Minotaur looming large over them all.\n\n \n\n\"Ever since Queen Pasiphae birthed the Minotaur, no one suitable has asked for the hands in marriage of me or my sisters.\" Ariadne clarified.\n\n \n\nAriadne nodded, understanding the complexity of their situation. But for now, she chose to focus on the joyous moment, the birth of a new life, a beacon of hope amidst their complicated lives. She smiled as the baby looked at her curiously. She held out her arms and Icarus somewhat reluctantly handed his son over. Ariadne breathed that delightful smell that only babies had. She forced down the longing to have one of her own. Ariadne was a princess, she would need a husband for that. Her father had made it clear that his daughters could not have children while unwed, not even if the father was a god. She asked Icarus about the pregnancy and childbirth and how it was like to look after a baby. Icarus answered all her questions.\n\n \n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Nicodemos, the head priest of Hades' shrine in Knossos. Ariadne knew him in passing, but she had no idea that he and Icarus were close. The housekeeper had followed behind the priest, looking terrified. Icarus nodded at her and th woman left, relief slumping in hr frame.\n\n \n\n\"Nicodemos, what brings you here?\" Icarus asked with a smile, greeting the priest kindly.\n\n \n\n\"I need your help, Icarus,\" Nicodemos said, his gaze lingering on baby Alexios.\n\n \n\n\"There have been deaths in Knossos and the surroundings, victims drained of their life force. It's the work of sorcerers looking to cheat death, a blasphemy towards Hades. I need to hunt them, but I am no hunter.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus looked at Alexios, his expression serious and very reluctant.\n\n \n\n\"And the favored victims are young demigods, due to their abundance of life force,\" Nicodemos added, clearly seeing the reason for Icarus' reluctance.\n\n \n\nThe room fell silent as the gravity of the situation sank in. The joy of their reunion was overshadowed by the looming threat, and they knew that their lives had just taken a dangerous turn. A threat had emerged, aimed directly at Icarus' son.\n\n \n\nRealizing that his own son might be in danger, Icarus agreed to help the priest. He turned to Ariadne. \"Can you look after Alexios for the night? Sorcerers work at night. I'll be back by dawn.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne gladly agreed, clutching Alexios close, afraid for the baby. Icarus handed her a dagger. \"Do you remember the dagger lessons I gave you when we were younger?\" he asked.\n\n \n\nAriadne confessed that she did, but she had barely had the opportunity to practice. With a final glance at his son, Icarus left with Nicodemos, ready to face the dangers that awaited them.\n\n \n\nIn the forests of Knossos, Icarus, the lover of, followed tracks and led Nicodemos, the head priest of the Shrine of Hades through the winding and treacherous paths.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" Nicodemos had spoken in Icarus' home.\n\n \n\n\"I need your help. Sorcerers are draining the life force from young demigods to cheat death. I an no hunter to find them and their dread lair.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus' heart had clenched at the mention of demigods. His son, a demigod born to him and Apollo, was still but an infant.\n\n \n\n\"I'll help you, Nicodemos.\" he said, determination burning in his eyes.\n\n \n\nTogether, they followed the tracks left by the sorcerers, leading them to a hidden lair. At a safe distance they readied their weapons. The bown and quiver of never ending arrows for Icarus and a simple looking black sword for Nicodemos. The priest had no intention of using his powers in order to hide who is father was. Icarus, aware of Nicodemos' secret lineage, turned to him.\n\n \n\n\"You're a son of Hades, aren't you? Thus able to control shadows and have no need to rely on just weapons.\" he asked, his gaze unwavering.\n\n \n\nNicodemos froze, his eyes wide. He had hoped to keep his lineage a secret, fearing the prejudice of others.\n\n \n\n\"How did you...?\" he stammered.\n\n \n\n\"I figured it out the first time we spoke. I was trained from the age of four to observe and take notice of anything unusual. When you are in the shrine, in your father's sacred space, the shadows misbehave around you,\" Icarus replied, a soft smile on his face.\n\n \n\n\"Your secret is safe with me.\" He sincerely reassured the priest.\n\n \n\nRelief visibly washed over Nicodemos.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you, Icarus. Not many are understanding.\"\n\n \n\n\"You can thank me by helping me protect my son.\" Icarus said, his voice firm.\n\n \n\n\"Let's put an end to these sorcerers.\"\n\n \n\nWith a nod, Nicodemos agreed, and together, they prepared to face the sorcerers, ready to protect those they held dear.\n\n \n\nAs they approached the lair, Nicodemos turned to Icarus.\n\n \n\n\"I'll need to use my shadow powers. Can you cover me?\" he asked.Icarus nodded, drawing his bow.\n\n \n\n\"I've got you covered.\" he said, his eyes scanning the area for any signs of the sorcerers.\n\n \n\nWith a deep breath, Nicodemos stepped into the shadows, his form blending with the darkness. Icarus watched as the shadows moved, strangling the sorcerers one by one. He shot down any sorcerer he spotted, his arrows finding their mark each time.\n\n \n\nThe sorcerers, caught by surprise and no match for the demigod son of a god as powerful as Hades and a hunter trained by Artemis herself, fell quickly. Soon, only Nicodemos and Icarus were left standing.\n\n \n\nNicodemos produced a jar, trapping the souls of the fallen sorcerers. \"This way, they won't evade the psychopomps. They'll go straight to the underworld, where they'll be harshly judged.\" he said, his voice filled with determination.\n\n \n\nIcarus nodded, relief washing over him. His son was safe, and the sorcerers were no more. Together, they had protected those they held dear. Nicodemos however glanced strangely at Icarus.\"You know, when people see me use my powers they usually run away screaming.\" The demigod confessed.\n\n \n\nIcarus snorted.\n\n \n\n\"You know, my lover is the god of plague and he skins people alive when vexed. A few shadows are not going to frighten me.\"\n\n \n\nNicodemos still looked stupified by Icarus' lack of reaction at his fearsome powers.\n\n \n\n\"When I was nine years old an unsavoury man followed me into the woods. I noticed him and prayed to Artemis to let her know. She told him to lead him to her. Once there she transformed him into a very strange creature right before my eyes. I think she called it a platypus? Haven't seen the like of it anywhere. No idea where she put it.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus, to further emphasize that he was unphased by the display of underworld powers, turned to Nicodemos.\n\n \n\n\"Between Artemis training me in childhood and having Apollo as my lover, I'm used to strangeness. You have nothing on the divine twins.\" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice.\n\n \n\nNicodemos chuckled, a rare sound in the somber shrine. \"I suppose I don't.\" he agreed, a smile tugging at his lips, his obsidian eyes sparkling.~~~~~~~~~~Modern times:\n\n \n\nThe morning sun had barely risen over Camp Half-Blood when the campers awoke to a startling revelation. A new demigod had arrived in the dead of night, chased into the camp by none other than the Minotaur. The news was delivered by a satyr, who revealed that the newcomer was the third incarnation of Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta, Apollo's greatest love.\n\n \n\nCharles Beckendorf, the head of Hephaestus Cabin, remembered the drones he and his siblings had placed around the camp's barriers. He quickly gathered the campers between the Hephaestus and Aphrodite cabins, where a sheet hung displaying the footage captured by the drones.\n\n \n\nThe campers watched in awe as a car was struck by lightning, and a beautiful girl emerged, challenging the Minotaur with a sword. The monster easily batted the sword away, but the girl was not deterred. She leapt onto the Minotaur, ripped off its horn, and used it to stab the beast to death.\n\n \n\nElis Wakefield, a son of Ares, could hardly believe his eyes.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus reborn as a girl? He was a boy both times!\" he exclaimed.\n\n \n\nHis brother Sherman was equally surprised, remarking, \"Apollo's beautiful tragic flower can actually fight worth a damn.\"\n\n \n\nElis shook his head and reminded reminded him, \"Hyacinthus was a Spartan prince. Of course he knew how to fight.\"\n\n \n\nBeckendorf hushed them as more footage played. They watched as Apollo appeared before the girl. She seemed to recognize him, then fell to her knees, screaming. The ground shook violently, and then the footage ended.\n\n \n\nKatie Gardiner, a daughter of Demeter, wondered aloud if the new incarnation could be a child of Demeter, given the shaking of the ground. Her sister Miranda had caused similar tremors when she was really angry. The Demeter campers seemed both uneasy and elated at the prospect of the fabled Hyacinthus being their sibling. The day had just begun, but it was clear that it would be anything but ordinary at Camp Half-Blood.\n\n \n\nDrew Tanaka, a daughter of Aphrodite, pointed out that the demigod was really pretty and was dressed fashionably, so it was possible that she was a daughter of Aphrodite. This comment drew laughter from the Athena campers, making Drew and her siblings angry.\n\n \n\nOne of the Athena demigods retorted, \"She killed the Minotaur with her bare hands, she didn't flirt with it.\"\n\n \n\nLuke Castellan asked, \"Has anyone seen Will Solace?\" Will's brother Lee looked around, startled. Michael checked the Apollo cabin. Will was not there.\n\n \n\nLee said, \"Apollo likely took Will to meet his mother. I hope she doesn't freak out at having an eight-year-old son. She looked about 12 or 13 years old. Imagine having an entire child thrown at you by someone you didn't even have an affair with.\"\n\n \n\nVictoria added, \"Not in this lifetime at least. Hyacinthus, the first incarnation definitely did, and so did Icarus, the second incarnation.\"The Athena campers looked uncomfortable. This was very close to their situations. Their mother produces them by meeting minds with their mortal fathers and then just drops the babies on the mortals out of the blue. Their fathers rarely react well, leading to Athena's Cabin having the highest number of year rounders. The Ares cabin also had a fair few but that was because their mothers were solders or police officers who died in the line of duty. Annabeth Chase especially looked angry, muttering something unflattering about her father. The rest of the campers pretended they did not hear.\n\n \n\nThe camp was abuzz with speculation and anticipation for what was to come.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, Dionysus arrived, clearly unhappy. He whined, \"I have to be civil to a spawn of Poseidon or risk getting shot or burned.\"\n\n \n\nSilena caught on and asked, \"Is the third Hyacinthus a daughter of Poseidon?\"\n\n \n\nDionysus, calling Silena 'Serena', confirmed, \"Yes, the new incarnation is Percy Jackson, daughter of Poseidon.\"\n\n \n\nSilena and Drew recognized the name. Drew, in particular, remembered Percy Jackson as the star of Galaxaura's agency. Drew had done a few gigs with them but was kept away from Percy Jackson.\n\n \n\nDionysus snorted, \"If I were harbouring a taboo demigod, I would keep her away from other demigods that might give the game away too.\"\n\n \n\nDrew was disappointed, she was sure Percy Jackson was an Aphrodite girl. Luke confirms that she was on the list of suspected demigods as a potential daughter of Aphrodite.\n\n \n\nJust then, Chiron arrived, telling Beckendorf and his siblings to pack up the projector and screen. He also told the rest of them to go back to their schedules.\n\n \n\nAnnabeth approached the centaur, wanting more information about the new camper and if she will get a quest. Dionysus laughed at Annabeth, calling her 'Annie Bell'.\n\n \n\n\"There have been no quests since the one of the golden apples failed pathetically and spectacularly,\" he said.\n\n \n\nLuke flinched, his hand going to the scar on his face.\n\nI have wanted to see Eros beaten to a pulp since he hurt my baby Nico in House of Hades.\n\nAsclepius has trials and tribulations as he tries to learn more about his mortal father Hyacinthus.\n\nIcarus and Nicodemos, the dynamic duo embark on another quest.\n\nPercy wakes up to a big surprise\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nAs the sun rose on the sacred island of Delos, Apollo, the god of light, looked down at his son, Asclepius. The boy had just turned six and was the perfect blend of his parents - Apollo's golden hair and Hyacinthus' purple eyes and charming smile.\n\n\"Today is a special day, Asclepius,\" Apollo said, his voice echoing through the quiet morning as he guided Asclepius to eat his breakfast. Asclepius got a hug everytime he finished his vegetables.\n\n \n\n\"Today, we journey to Sparta.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius looked up at his father, his purple eyes wide with curiosity. Apollo rarely liked to speak of Sparta. He had taken wroth ever since Zeus had declined haing Asclepius recognized as the son of Hyacinthus, who had been the Crown Prince of Sparta. That would make Asclepius the rightful heir to the throne of Sparta, but Zeus had felt that given the circumstances of Asclepius's birth it would be too difficult and disruptive for the mortals.\n\n \n\n\"Why, father?\" he asked.\n\n \n\nApollo smiled, but his golden eyes were pained and sad. He ruffled his son's golden hair.\n\n \n\n\"To honor your mortal father, Prince Hyacinthus. Every spring, the people of Sparta hold a festival in his honor, the Hyacinthia.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius' eyes sparkled with excitement.\n\n \n\n\"Will they like me, father?\" he asked, a hint of nervousness in his voice.\n\n \n\nApollo knelt down, meeting his son's gaze. \"They will love you, Asclepius. Just as I do. Just as Hyacinthus would have loved you had he gotten the chance to meet you\"\n\n \n\nWith that, father and son embarked on their journey to Sparta. Asclepius was filled with a sense of wonder and anticipation. This was his first time leaving Delos, and he was eager to learn about his heritage and the world beyond his home. Even if Zeus had decreed that Sparta would never be Asclepius', the boy wanted to learn anything he could about it. He dearly wished to feel connected to his mortal father. Whenever Apollo was away, Asclepius would spend his time watching the statues and murals of Hyacinthus all over the Delos palace. Every year Apollo seemed to add more, all made by his own hands.\n\n \n\nAs they arrived in Sparta, the city was alive with the joyous sounds of the Hyacinthia festival. Apollo and Asclepius were welcomed with open arms. Asclepius, with his golden hair and purple eyes, was the center of attention.\n\n \n\nThroughout the day, Asclepius learned about his mortal father, his heroic deeds, and his tragic end. He felt a connection to Hyacinthus, a bond that transcended time and death. As the festival came to a close, Asclepius felt a sense of fulfillment. He had honored his mortal father and embraced his heritage.As they were leaving the festival, they saw two young women standing by the woods. One was Artemis, goddess of the hunt, and Apollo's twin sister. The other was Princess Polyboea of Sparta, an immortalized companion of Artemis and the younger sister of Prince Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\nPolyboea's eyes teared up when she saw Asclepius. \"You have Hyacinthus' eyes,\" she said, her voice choked with emotion.\n\n \n\nAsclepius smiled, his heart swelling with pride. \"Thank you, Aunt Polyboea,\" he said.\n\n \n\nPolyboea wept openly now. \"And you have his smile too,\" she said, her voice barely a whisper.As they prepared to return to Delos, a soldier approached them. He was a devout follower of Apollo and had been sent by King Argalus, the eldest half-brother of Hyacinthus, to assassinate Asclepius. But the soldier could not bring himself to harm the child of his god. The soldier was of middle age. He recalled having served under the extraordinary Prince Hyacinthus. He was even more loathe to harm a child of the late and beloved prince. Even if he coud not understand how this miraculous child had come to be.\n\n \n\n\"I cannot do it, Lord Apollo,\" the soldier confessed, falling to his knees. \"King Argalus fears Asclepius will threaten his throne. He ordered me to... to...\"\n\n \n\nApollo's face darkened, his golden eyes gleaming with a thirst for vengeance. The god had tolerated Argalus, suffered him to live and wear the crown that rightfully belonged to Asclepius and Argalus dared to do this. Apollo would punish him.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you for your honesty, soldier. You have done well.\"\n\n \n\nIn his wrath, Apollo sent a horrific disease to Argalus, which killed him slowly and painfully. After a month, Argalus died. Since he had no heir, the kingdom of Sparta passed to his brother Cynortas, who had a young son, Oebalus.\n\n \n\nCynortas was yet another bitter, jealous fool still hating a long dead man. But his son Oebalus was deeply devoted to Apollo and his uncle Hyacinthus. Apollo took note of this, vowing to keep an eye on Oebalus, the promising boy since he properly respected and honored Hyacinthus' memory. Cynortas would be endured until Oebalus was old enough and could rule on his own uncontested.\n\n \n\nThat night, as they returned to Delos, Asclepius, being none the wiser to his mortal uncle's deadly intentions, looked up at his father with that heartbreaking smile he had inherited from Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you, father,\" he said, his voice filled with gratitude. \"Today, I truly understood what it means to be the son of Apollo and Hyacinthus.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nAsclepius, the demigod son of Apollo and Prince Hyacinthus, stepped into Chiron's training camp with a sense of trepidation. He was only twelve, but his life had been anything but ordinary. Raised by his godly father, an unusual occurrence for demigods, Asclepius was used to the comforts of Delos and the constant presence of Apollo.\n\n \n\nHis arrival at the camp was met with curious and envious glances. Apollo had ensured that Asclepius had his own private quarters, a luxury not afforded to the other campers. This stirred feelings of envy among his half-brothers and the other campers.\n\n \n\nOne evening, as Asclepius was returning to his quarters, he was confronted by a group of Ares' and Zeus' sons.\n\n \n\n\"Look who it is,\" one of them sneered. \"The golden boy.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius stood his ground, meeting their gaze as his hand fell to his sword. The same sword that his mortal father had once used at Asclepius age. His grandmother Clio had given it to him before Asclepius prepared to come to camp. It was the same sword Hyacinthus had taken to camp with him\n\n \n\n\"Is there a problem?\" he asked.\n\n \n\nThe tallest among them, a son of Ares, stepped forward. \"We don't believe your story, Asclepius,\" he said. \"We think your real mother is Princess Coronis, the woman foolish enough to cheat on a god.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius felt a pang of anger. \"My father is Apollo, the god of truth,\" he said firmly. \"And my grandmother Clio, the muse of history, has recorded my lineage. Are you doubting their words? Do you really want to publicly doubt their words?\"\n\n \n\nThe boys were taken aback. They had not expected Asclepius to stand up for himself. An certainly neither of them wanted to suffer Apollo's wrath if they called him, the god of truth, a liar. They exchanged glances, then turned and walked away.\n\n \n\nAs the days passed, Asclepius proved himself to be a worthy camper. He excelled in his training and showed kindness to everyone just like his mortal father had many years ago, even those who doubted him. His actions spoke louder than any words, and slowly, the campers began to accept him. Some of his half-brothers even began getting over their jealousy over Asclepius being the absolute favorite of their father. He enjoyed talking to his brothers, especially about healing, Asclepius' strongest power so far.\n\n \n\nLater, during a tutoring session with Chiron, Asclepius asked about his mortal father, Hyacinthus. Chiron hesitated before speaking, \"Hyacinthus was a very beautiful child, extremely skilled in combat, an excellent tactician, and a gifted singer and lyre player.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius pressed for more personal details. Chiron hesitated again, then shared, \"Hyacinthus was kind to the lower-class demigods. But his friends, Smilax and Crocus, were problematic. Smilax, a daughter of Aphrodite, goaded many sons of Zeus and Ares to go after Medusa and die. Crocus had a terrible temper and often fought with sons of Ares.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius frowned, \"Did Smilax have a reason for her actions?\"Chiron shook his head, \"I do not know. I cared for many sons of Zeus since they were toddlers. Their mothers often bring them to camp as soon as they are weaned to protect their sons and themselves from Hera's wrath.\"\n\n \n\nChiron's sad expression told Asclepius that it did not usually work. Hera would not relent in her wrath and vengeance. The sons of Zeus were safe at camp. Gods could not kill demigods here as per Zeus' decree. At least not openly. So called accidents did happen. And they were not safe once they aged out and left.\n\n \n\nAsclepius thought of Crocus, the late lover of Hermes.\"About Crocus, was it really his fault? The sons of Ares are always spoiling for a fight and they really go out of their way to provoke others.\"\n\n \n\n\"I have talked to a few sons of Poseidon here. They seem quite pleasant to me.\"Chiron chose not to answer and left to attend to other campers. Asclepius was alone with his thoughts, and the stories of his father's past. He really wished he could have met his father Hyacinthus so he would not have to rely on second hand accounts on what his father was like. Asclepius stared at the setting sun in the distance, recalling Apollo's words on how much Hyacinthus loved sunrises and sunsets. If only there was a way he could met his mortal parent.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~\n\n \n\nAsclepius, the 12-year-old demigod son of Apollo, was on a mission. The camp was low on medicinal supplies due to a recent skirmish involving the sons of Zeus, Poseidon, and Ares. Chiron had no idea who had started it but it had left almost everyone in camp with some kind of injury. Asclepius and his brothers worked tirelessly to heal and fix up everyone. While no one died or was left maimed, it did drain nearly all of the medicinal supples.\n\n \n\nAfter resting to recover from the exhaustion, every son of Apollo was working overtime to replenish the stores of medicinal herbs, especially shepherd's purse, a wildflower weed used on bleeding wounds. It was early spring, and Asclepius had little hope of finding any. Shepherd's purse bloomed mid spring to mid summer.\n\n \n\nTo his surprise, he found a trail of the plant. Elated, he began harvesting it carefully, storing it in his pouch. He followed the trail, intent on his task, and ended up far away from the camp. Suddenly, he ran into a pack of monsters.\n\n \n\nHis bow was back at the camp, but thankfully, he had his sword. It used to belong to his father, Hyacinthus, and Asclepius never left it behind. But the monsters were too many.\n\n \n\nIn the distance, he saw a patch of hyacinth flowers that seemed to be beckoning him. Trusting his instincts, he ran towards them and stood in the middle of the patch. To his surprise, the monsters became confused, as if they couldn't see him anymore. They searched around, trying to find him, but couldn't see Asclepius even though he was standing right in front of them, in the middle of the hyacinth flower patch.\n\n \n\nAsclepius wondered if this was his mortal father, Hyacinthus, protecting him from Elysium. But to his dismay, the flowers seemed to be withering one by one. Thankfully, the monsters left before all the hyacinth flowers withered completely. Asclepius was left alone, surrounded by the fading hyacinths, a symbol of his father's love and protection. He knew then that he was truly the son of Apollo and Hyacinthus, and no amount of doubt from others could change that.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, a voice echoed around him. \"Asclepius!\" It was Apollo, his divine father, who had spotted him from his sun chariot and manifested a part of his consciousness on the ground.\n\n \n\n\"What are you doing so far from the camp? And why are you harvesting a flower not even in season?\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius turned to face his father, his heart pounding. \"Father,\" he said, \"I found a trail of shepherd's purse. We needed it for the camp. But then I ran into monsters...\"\n\n \n\nApollo's face softened. \"And the hyacinths protected you,\" he finished, looking at the withering flowers.\n\n \n\n\"Your mortal father...Hyacinthus...he must have been watching over you.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius nodded.\n\n \n\n\"I think so, Father. They couldn't see me when I stood among the hyacinths.\"\n\n \n\nApollo sighed, his anger dissipating.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you, Hyacinthus,\" he murmured, looking at the flowers which seemed to perk up in the presence of the sun god. \"For protecting our son.\"\n\n \n\nApollo escorted Asclepius back to the camp. Once there, the sun god reprimanded Chiron the centaur for sending his son to look for a plant not even in season. Chiron paled. He hadn't realized that Asclepius would wander off this far. He apologized to Apollo.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" Chiron said, \"I didn't realize he would wander off this far. I apologize.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's gaze was stern. \"Do not misplace my son anymore, Chiron,\" he warned, \"or there will be dire consequences.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius, meanwhile, had an idea. He decided to get some hyacinths, place them in pots, and use them during stealth games at camp. He wanted to find out the extent of the hyacinth's protection. His misadventure had taught him a valuable lesson about his heritage and the power of the hyacinth flowers.\n\n \n\nHidden under the foliage, the god Zephyrus watched. He couldn't stand that Apollo had a child with Hyacinthus. He had tried to destroy Asclepius in the womb before but failed. He hoped to succeed now but was thwarted by the dead Hyacinthus himself, protecting Asclepius from the underworld. Zephyrus quickly left, making as much distance from the camp as possible. If he were spotted, Apollo would be uncontrollable. Even Zeus would not keep him from pursuing Zephyrus for vengeance. He found a forest with a thick canopy to hide under until night fell.\n\n \n\nIn the forest, Zephyrus, the god of the west wind, found himself drawn to a patch of hyacinth flowers. As he neared, an ominous glow enveloped the flowers, their vibrant hues seeming to bleed into the surrounding air. Compelled by a force beyond his understanding, Zephyrus reached out to touch one of the flowers.\n\n \n\nThe moment his fingers brushed against the petals, a searing pain shot through his hand. The west wind howled in agony, his screams echoing through the forest, disturbing a flock of birds and several deer. He recoiled, backing away from the flowers.\n\n \n\n\"How unfair,\" Zephyrus lamented, \"that even in death, Hyacinthus despises me.\"\n\n \n\nThe flowers responded to his sorrow with an intensified glow, their perfume thickening in the air. The sweet scent quickly turned into a choking miasma, assaulting Zephyrus' nostrils and throat. Overwhelmed and terrified, he took to the skies, fleeing from the vengeful flowers.\n\n \n\nFrom his sun chariot, Apollo, the sun god, spotted the retreating figure of Zephyrus. Ever since the death of Hyacinthus, Apollo had harbored a fierce, burning hatred for Zephyrus. Seizing the opportunity, Apollo let loose a barrage of flaming arrows, each one aimed at the west wind. The god of archery never missed a shot.\n\n \n\nZephyrus, already in pain and fear, sought refuge under the dense foliage. Under the protective canopy of leaves, he painstakingly removed seventy-seven arrows from his burning flesh. Each arrow brought back the memory of the lost Spartan Prince, Hyacinthus, fleeing from him in Delphi and the role he had played in his untimely demise. The pain was a harsh reminder of his past actions, a punishment he was doomed to endure in the realm of the divine. To escape being torn to pieces and thrown into Tartarus just like his uncle Helios had been, Zephyrus had no choice but to swear himself in eternal servitude to Eros.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIcarus:\n\n \n\nIn the heart of Daedalus' grand mansion, a moment of pure joy unfolded. The inner courtyard, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun, was alive with anticipation. Icarus, the son of Daedalus, knelt on the cobblestones, his arms outstretched towards his own son, Alexios.\n\n \n\nAlexios, a cherubic child with curls as golden as his father Apollo's sun rays, was standing unsteadily on his tiny feet. His first words, \"Tata\" for Icarus and \"Pater\" for Apollo, still echoed in the hearts of those present. Now, it was time for another milestone - his first steps.\n\n \n\nIcarus, his eyes gleaming with paternal pride and love, gently coaxed Alexios.\n\n \n\n\"Come to Tata, Alexios,\" he encouraged, his voice soft yet filled with excitement. Alexios, understanding his father's words, let out a bubbly giggle, his face lighting up with a radiant smile.\n\n \n\nWith a determined look on his face, Alexios moved one chubby foot forward, then the other. Each step was shaky, yet filled with the promise of the many strides he would take in his life. The courtyard held its breath as Alexios toddled towards Icarus, his small arms reaching out for his father.\n\n \n\nIn the shade of the fig tree, Princess Ariadne and Daedalus watched the scene unfold. Ariadne, Icarus's best friend, had a tender smile on her face, her eyes sparkling with unshed tears of joy. Daedalus, the clever and renowned craftsman, looked at his grandson with indulgent affection, his heart swelling with pride. He fondly recalled many years past, when Daedalus stood in Icarus's place and Icarus' in Alexios.\n\n \n\nAs Alexios finally reached Icarus and fell into his father's waiting arms, a cheer erupted in the courtyard. Icarus scooped up Alexios, hugging him close, his heart overflowing with love for his son. The sun god Apollo, from his celestial abode, cast a warm, golden glow over the scene, blessing his lover and their son.\n\n \n\nAnd so, under the watchful eyes of his mortal loved ones and the benevolent sun, Alexios took his first steps, marking the beginning of his journey in the world. It was a moment etched in the hearts of all present, a testament to the enduring love and bond between a father and his son.\n\n \n\n\"He's growing up so fast,\" Ariadne murmured, and Daedalus, nodded in agreement, smiling fondly at his grandson.\n\n \n\nAs the moment passed and Alexios napped peacefully in Icarus' lap as sunlight danced playfully around them both, the conversation took a more serious turn. Daedalus began to speak of the Labyrinth, his voice heavy with concern. \"The Labyrinth... it's evolving beyond our design. It's drawing in more monsters now, not just keeping the Minotaur trapped.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus and Ariadne exchanged worried glances. Both of them wanted the Minotaur dead and eagerly awaited the arrival of the heroic son of Poseidon that would slay it.\n\n \n\n\"This does not bode well,\" Icarus muttered, his gaze drifting upwards towards Apollo in the sun chariot. He was always able to decipher his lover's moods by the feel of sunlight on his skin.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo seems displeased with you, father. Why?\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus sighed, his shoulders slumping and his gray eyes looking everywhere except Icarus.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo warned me not to give the Labyrinth a consciousness. But maintaining the magic was taking a toll on Queen Pasiphae, so we risked it.\"\n\n \n\n\"Was there truly no other solution?\" Icarus asked, his voice filled with worry. \"The god of prophecy warned you not to.\"\n\n \n\n\"I... I should have listened,\" Daedalus admitted, shame coloring his words.\"I really should have.\"\"The malevolent consciousness is still trapped within the Labyrinth. As long as people don't set foot inside, it is safe enough.\"\n\n \n\n\"But how is the prophesied son of Poseidon supposed to survive the Labyrinth long enough to slay the Minotaur?\" Icarus questioned, his brow furrowed in thought.\n\n \n\n\"Someone with clear sight would be able to navigate the Labyrinth with no trouble, as long as they can also deal with the monsters,\" Daedalus confessed.\n\n \n\nIcarus turned to look at Ariadne, the only person he knew with clear sight. Pasiiphae had often spoken to them about clear sight. Ariadne's gift was one of the reasons she was her mother's favorite child. Icarus had a small touch of it but it did not hold up to mid and high level magical illusions. He would not be able to navigate the Labyrinth.\n\n \n\n\"Ariadne...\" he began, his voice trailing off as he considered the implications. The future suddenly seemed fraught with uncertainty, and Icarus could only hope that they would find a way to navigate the challenges that lay ahead.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, the housekeeper arrived, announcing, \"Master Icarus, Nicodemos, the head priest of the Shrine of Hades, is here to see you.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus, always the gracious host, invited Nicodemos to join them.\n\n \n\n\"Nicodemos, please, sit with us. We have plenty of food and wine to share.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus, however, was not as pleased to see the priest. He knew that Nicodemos' visits usually meant trouble. Daedalus was not aware that Nicodemos was a Son of Hades, and thus had vast powers at his disposal which made the dangerous quests that much easier to handle.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" he said, his voice filled with concern, \"you know what happens when Nicodemos comes calling. It's always some dangerous quest.\"\n\n \n\nAfter Nicodemos had partaken of the food and wine, Daedalus asked him, \"So, Nicodemos, what plagues Knossos now?\"\n\n \n\nNicodemos sighed, \"A single but skilled sorcerer practicing blood magic. He uses the lifeblood of demigods, typically adolescents. The wayward souls of three demigods found their way to the Shrine of Hades. Their stepfathers sold them to the sorcerer in exchange for magical good luck.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne, holding out her hands for Alexios, pointed out, \"This will likely offend the goddess Tyche. All the kingdom could be affected if she unleashes her wrath about this sacriledge.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus turned to Icarus, \"You should wear the armor I made recently. Queen Pasiphae wove protective magics on it.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus nodded at his father before his expression turned thoughtful.\n\n \n\n\"Have you noticed a worrying trend of sorcerors going for demigods? This can't be normal?\"\n\n \n\nNicodemos sighed again, rubbing his temples vigorously.\n\n \n\n\"Is because of the king and queen.\" He said with an apologetic glance at the princess.\n\n \n\nAriadne did not take offense but wanted to hear his reasoning.\n\n \n\n\"How so?\" The princess asked.\n\n \n\n\"The king is quite frankly a tyrant.\" He again gave a silent apology to Ariadne to just grimaced, accepting that the priest was completely right.\n\n \n\n\"And my mother?\"\n\n \n\n\"The queen's godly tittle is Immortal Sorceress.\"\n\n \n\n\"Corrupted and dar Sorcerors hear that and think that their disgusting practices will be tolerated here. The thief assumes everyone is a thief and all that. Of course, the king is more concerned with keeping his reign secure and eliminating political rivals. He does not bat an eyelash when demigods die. Less potential rivals for him. Therefore Crete is a haven for sorcerors willing to dabble in the forbidden.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIcarus took Nicodemos to their armoury. Icarus put on the armour, Nicodemos helping him with some of the bindings. They looked around for something that fit Nicodemos. It was not as fine as the one Icarus wore, but it would service and protect the priest.\n\n \n\nSometime later they stood at the edge of the city, ready to embark on their quest. They were to hunt a sorcerer practicing blood magic with the lifeblood of demigods. Nicodemos knew of three victims that had been sold to the sorcerer by their stepfather.\n\n \n\nIcarus sighed, \"I wish the gods would not dally with married women. Their husbands are never happy. Unable to retaliate against the god who cuckolded them, they take it out on their wives and stepchildren.\"\n\n \n\nNicodemos sighed in unhappy resignation. Icarus noticed this and asked, \"Is this something that happened to you, Nicodemos?\"\n\n \n\nNicodemos nodded, \"My mother was not married. She was betrothed though. Her betrothed called it off when her pregnancy showed and my mother's family were furious. Hades threatened them so they left my mother and me in peace. However, my powers terrified them. When my mom died when I was nine years old, my grandparents took me to a sanctuary of Hades to be a priest. They have not tried to get in touch since. I am now 24 years old.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus looked at Nicodemos with sympathy, \"Your grandparents were wrong, Nicodemos. I'm sorry for what you and your mother had to go through. You both definitely deserved better.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, they set off on their quest, determined to bring justice to the victims of the sorcerer's blood magic.\n\n \n\nNicodemos, with his unique ability to trace spiritual pollution, led them to a fine villa nestled in the outskirts of the city.\n\n \n\nIcarus, a skilled hunter and a follower of Artemis, ensured their approach was stealthy, \"Stay low, Nicodemos. We can't afford to alert the sorcerer.\"\n\n \n\nAs they ambushed the sorcerer, they found a red-haired girl, about 12 years old, tied at his feet. Spotting them, she recognized Icarus as a follower of Artemis and bit into the sorcerer's calf, tearing off a chunk of his flesh. Keeping him nice and distracted for her two rescuers.\n\n \n\nThe sorcerer howled in pain, and Nicodemos seized the opportunity, binding him with his shadow powers.\n\n \n\n\"Stay still, you vile creature!\" he commanded.\n\n \n\nIcarus, seizing the moment, sneaked up behind the sorcerer, stabbing him in the kidney with one hunting knife and slicing his throat clean with the other. The sorcerer fell to the ground, spraying blood everywhere.\n\n \n\nIcarus kicked the sorcerer's corpse away and immediately set to cutting the ropes binding the little girl. As Nicodemos moved to help, the girl screamed, \"Stay away!\"\n\n \n\nIcarus reassured her, \"Don't be prejudiced, child. Children of Hades are not evil even if their powers look scary. He always protects the innocent from actual evil.\"\n\n \n\nPhoebe looked confused, \"I don't want him near me because he is a man.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus pointed out, \"But I am a man too.\"\n\n \n\nPhoebe retorted, \"You're different. As a renowned follower of Artemis, you're the single good one out of a sea of evil bastards.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus asked, \"What's your name, little one?\"\n\n \n\nShe replied, \"My name is Phoebe.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus smiled, \"Phoebe, would you like to meet Artemis? You would fit in perfectly with the other hunters.\"\n\n \n\nPhoebe's eyes sparkled with delight, \"Really? I would love that! I have been secretly practicing archery since I was six years old!\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, their quest ended, not just with the defeat of a sorcerer but with the rescue of a future hunter of Artemis.\n\n \n\nWith the sorcerer defeated and Phoebe safe, Nicodemos announced, \"I must return to Knossos to attend to my father's shrine.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus nodded, \"Go, Nicodemos. We will meet again. Evil never rests after all.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, Icarus and Phoebe journeyed to the edge of the forest. There, Icarus prayed to Artemis, sending her a mental summary of their adventure. Shortly after, Artemis appeared. Ever since the fallout with Aura she had started taking younger forms. Today she looked like a girl of fifteen years old instead of the young woman of seemingly twenty that Icarus had known his entire life. Aura had left quite the mark on Artemis.\n\n \n\nShe looked at Phoebe and asked, \"Do you wish to swear eternal maidenhood and join my hunters?\"\n\n \n\nA delighted Phoebe accepted, \"Yes, Artemis. I will swear my sacred vows to you.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus watched as Phoebe swore her vows to Artemis. He then bowed respectfully to Artemis and took his leave, \"Until we meet again, Artemis.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nModern Era\n\n \n\nPercy Jackson, the third reincarnation of Hyacinthus, with her mother Sally and her friend Grover had been hurrying to reach Camp Half-Blood. Their journey was interrupted by a Minotaur at the border. Their car was struck by lightning, causing chaos and confusion. In the ensuing turmoil, the Minotaur made Sally vanish. Percy felt the blood boil in her veins. The mere sight of the beast awoke a murderous hatred within her. For reasons she could not explain, she loathed the creature in a deeply personal manner. Seeing it destroy her beloved mother did not scare Percy into submission and despair. It spurred her into vengeful action.\n\n \n\nPercy, undeterred, pulled out her hair clip, which transformed into the sword Riptide, and leapt at the beast. The Minotaur, however, smacked the sword out of her hands. With no other option, Percy charged at the Minotaur, ripped off one of his horns, and stabbed him to death with it. She could feel part of her buried deep inside, rejoice and relishing the destruction of the beast.\n\n \n\nAs she stood victorious, a beautiful golden-haired man appeared. Percy's mind shattered as she recognized him as the sun god Apollo. Memories of her past lives as the Spartan Prince Hyacinthus and the Cretan Hunter Icarus flooded back. The sorrows, pain, and tragedies of two lifetimes hit her like a battering ram. She screamed in agony, both physical and emotional, and crumpled to the ground. As the world went black, the last thing she saw were Apollo's worried golden eyes.\n\n \n\nWhen Percy woke up, she found herself in a strange bed in an infirmary. She sat up, disoriented, not sure who she was or where she was. She felt the presence of two powerful godly auras nearby. One was unmistakably Apollo, and the other was a mix of sea and storm, unfamiliar but powerful.\n\n \n\nJust minutes before Grover knocked at the door of the Montauk beach cabin, Sally had told her that her father was the god Poseidon. Percy burst into hysterical laughter. She hadn't quite believed it then, but now it was undeniable. The sound of her laughter brought in Apollo, a little boy with blonde hair and green eyes, and a man in a hideous Hawaiian shirt whom she recognized as the ice cream seller she had met a few times at the beach in Montauk.\n\n \n\nPercy looked at them and said, \"So, it's all true. I'm the daughter of Poseidon, and I've lived two past lives. This is... a lot to take in.\"\n\n \n\nApollo replied, \"Indeed, Percy. But remember, you're not alone. We're here with you.\"\n\n \n\nLooking at the little boy with blonde hair and green eyes. Percy startled. The boy looked like a mini copy of Apollo, but he had her green eyes and her smile.\n\n \n\n\"Who is he?\" Percy asked Apollo, her voice shaky.\n\n \n\nApollo looked at her, his eyes filled with a strange mix of joy and sadness.\n\n \n\n\"While you were asleep I monitored your dreams to check what was happening to you. Do you remember the art gallery you and Grover visited while attending Yancy? The one filled with paintings of my romances with your past lives, Hyacinthus and Icarus?\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, her mind flashing back to the last painting. The Icarus tree, created from the corpse of Icarus, birthing a child.\n\n \n\n\"Is it true?\" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. \"Did you somehow create a child with the Icarus tree?\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded. \"I asked Persephone to create a connection between the Icarus tree and your soul. When you left the underworld to be reborn, the tree pulled your demigod essence to alert me that Hyacinthus was once again alive. Several years after the event, I infused the tree with my essence, trying to see a vision of you and your whereabouts. However, instead of the vision, our essences combined to create Will Solace.\"\n\n \n\nPercy looked at Will, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\n \n\n\"Are you... are you my son?\" she asked.\n\n \n\nWill smiled, his green eyes sparkling with unshed tears of joy.\n\n \n\n\"I am William Alexios Solace,\" he said.\n\n \n\nPercy whispered the name Alexios in a broken voice, looking at Apollo with desperate hope, the sun god nodded sadly.\n\n \n\n\"It wasn't just you who was reborn,\" he said. Confirming what she suspected.\n\n \n\nPercy grabbed Will and hugged him close, crying and peppering his face with kisses. \"Thank you,\" she said over and over again, her voice muffled by his shirt. \"Thank you.\"\n\n \n\nJust then, Poseidon spoke up, his face a thundercloud. \"What is going on here?\" he demanded, brandishing his trident.\n\n \n\nApollo stepped forward, his hands raised in a placating gesture. \"Poseidon, I can explain...\"\n\n \n\n\"You better,\" Poseidon growled. \"How on earth did you have a child with my very male grandson Icarus? And now you have an 8-year-old son with my 12-year-old daughter?\"\n\n \n\nPercy, still hugging Will, spoke up.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo turned Icarus into a woman for nine months,\" she said quietly.\n\n \n\nPoseidon's eyes widened in shock.\n\n \n\n\"You gave a sex change to my perfect grandson?\" he roared, turning to Apollo. \"This is the second time you've pulled stunts with my descendants!\"\n\n \n\nApollo protested, \"Will is an essence baby. I was nowhere near Percy.\"\n\n \n\nBut Poseidon was still furious. \"This is unacceptable, Apollo!\" he shouted, his voice echoing off the infirmary walls. \"Unacceptable!\"\n\n \n\nPercy decided she should rescue her sort of boyfriend from her father.\n\n\"Lord Poseidon?\" She addressed the sea god, opting for the most respectful address. It had the opposite effect. Poseidon's face darkened further.\n\nPercy thought it wiser to dial down the formality.\n\n\"Lord Father?\" His scowl lessened slightly, but it remained in his face.\n\n \n\nPercy decided to take the plunge.\n\n \n\n\"Dad?\" Now Poseidon's face lost the fierce scowl, and he turned his attention to her.\n\n \n\n\"I would not have liked to wake up with my memories restored and not have Will here. My memories of the Underworld are still very fuzzy, but when Zagreus sneaked me out of Elysium to reincarnate me, I did beg him to give me Alexios back.\"\n\nPoseidon is really jealous. His daughter remembers having two other fathers. And unlike him, who had to stay away due to the ancient laws and to prevent her from being discovered, Amyclas and Daedalus were there the whole time.\n\nThe Hyacinthus Arc is now done. Future chapters will have the continuation of the Icarus Arc and of course Percy's adventures.\n\nPasiphae takes measures. Daedalus receives an unwanted guest. Ariadne enlightens Icarus.\n\nPercy realizes how destructive her fatal flaw can be.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nIn the royal chambers of Crete, Queen Pasiphae summoned Icarus, the lover of Apollo and the best friend of her daughter, Princess Ariadne.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" she began, her voice filled with concern, \"I need your help. King Minos is desperate to find a husband for Ariadne. But the suitors he has found are not suitable.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus with a heavy heart, and his face serious, asked, \"What can I do, my Queen?\"\n\n \n\nPasiphae revealed the truth about the suitors. Her inhumanly flawless face twisted with disgust, anger and worry about her favorite child.\n\n \n\n\"These suitors that my husband has scrounged up. They are all too old, have been married before, and their wives died mysteriously. I have investigated and found that two of them beat their wives to death, and the third let his wife die because he was too cheap to hire a physician.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus' eyes hardened. One of his hands dropping to his sword. With great effort he removed his hand from the hilt and balled it into a tight fist as he exhaled a breath of rage. Not for the first time, he repressed the urge to walk up to the king and stab the tyrant in his face. Unfortunately, Minos held Zeus' favor. Minos was also a demigod of one of the Great Three. Icarus was good enough to give his friend Nicodemos a somewhat decent challenge but the priest had won every single one of their bouts and spars.\n\n \n\n\"They cannot be allowed near Ariadne. I would gladly kill them all, but they are the king's guests, and I would be violating Xenia.\"\n\n \n\nViolating Xenia was something just not done by anyone with an ounce of sense. It would bring the wrath of the gods on the perpetrator and eveything they held dear.\n\n \n\nPasiphae nodded, understanding his predicament. As a very minor immortal goddess, and the daughter of a disgraced titan at that, she was quite vulnerable herself to the whims of the Olympians.\n\n \n\n\"There are other ways, Icarus. You often act as the king's cupbearer due to your good looks. I have a powder that, when added to their wine cups, will make them repulsed by the idea of marrying Ariadne.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus took the ring containing the powder and put it on the fourth finger of his right hand. It fit perfectly, as expected of something given to him by the precise, exacting queen. The ring was gold, adorned with a large red ruby. It had a clever hinge that opened to show a small, hidden compartment full of a purple reddish powder. Icarus nodded, the queen had even accounted for the color. This would be undetectable in wine.\n\n \n\n\"But Minos will grow suspicious if this happens with another set of suitors.\"\n\n \n\nPasiphae reassured him, \"I am now forewarned. If anyone who does not meet my standards tries to ask for Ariadne's hand, they will be dealt with before they set foot in the palace and Xenia is invoked.\"\" This time, I was caught by surprise.\" The queen admitted, looking embarrassed.\n\n \n\nWith a determined nod, Icarus agreed to the plan. The fate of Ariadne was now in their hands, and they would do whatever it took to protect her. Ariadne was beloved of them both, they would not allow her to sold to some brute who would mistreat her.Then, Pasiphae confessed something she had kept in her heart for a long time.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus, when you and Ariadne were children, I had hoped that you two would marry one another. I knew that you were a good boy and would become a good man. I would have had no fear for my daughter's future in your hands. But Minos wanted Kings or Crown Princes for his daughters. He disregarded my advice as he always does.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus looked at her, surprised.\n\n \n\n\"My Queen, while I love Ariadne like a sister, I have never been in love with her. I am in love with Apollo.\"\n\n \n\nPasiphae nodded with a rueful smile, understanding his feelings but at the same time pitying his still lingering naivety about some things in life.\n\n \n\n\"Love has little to do with marriage, Icarus. I do not love, like or even respect Minos. I had to marry him because I was ordered to do so by the king of the gods. I eagerly wait for Minos to die, either of old age, or hopefully to some gruesome violence. As an immortal goddess, I can afford to wait him out. I have been alive for thousands of years and will see thousands more. My loathed husband will one day be just a distant, unpleasant memory. Once Minos is dead, I will be free to go home. My daughter's days are finite. I would prefer for her to spend them in happiness or at least safety and contentment.\"\n\n \n\nIn the grand hall of King Minos Icarus was serving as a cupbearer. His beauty, coupled with his lineage as the son of the famous inventor Daedalus, added a touch of charm to the royal gathering. Minos only called Icarus whenever he really needed to impress someone. It showed how desperate the king was to marry off at least one daughter of he was calling Icarus for ordinary noblemen.\n\n \n\nThe last time Icarus had been called to serve wine it had been nearly a year ago, when the King of Cyprus visited. That king had been the son and high priest of Aphrodite. He had almost gotten handsy with Icarus, prompting Apollo to cover his whole arm with painful blisters. It still brought a smile to Icarus when he recalled the self-satisfied rat's shrieks of pain. After that the King of Cyprus had been a model guest, while glancing fearfully at any spot of sunshine and stubbornly staying in the shadows. As if that would truly protect him should Apollo decide he wanted to exact more revenge.\n\n \n\nKing Minos was entertaining three men of status and wealth, all potential suitors for Princess Ariadne. As they discussed women in crude terms, Icarus felt a wave of disgust but held his tongue.The three men divided women in three categories wives, whores and shrews. No middle ground, no exceptions.Icarus had to remind himself that had a mission to accomplish. After this he would pray to Artemis and tell her about these men. The huntresses always wanted target practice after all and what better than men who mistreated women. The wolves that Artemis kept as pets also always needed sustenance.\n\n \n\nAs he poured wine into their cups, he discreetly added a magic powder given to him by Queen Pasiphae. This powder, once ingested, would make the suitors repulsed by the idea of marrying Ariadne. It would take a few hours to take effect, but Icarus was patient.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, the suitors started glancing at Icarus. As the wine flowed, the suitors' eyes lingered on Icarus. One, gray-haired and paunchy, leered openly.King Minos noticed, scowled, and quickly intervened.\n\n \n\n\"Enough,\" he warned the suitor. \"Don't look that way.\"\n\n \n\nMinos still recalled the incident with the King of Cyprus and did not want another repeat. Icarus suspected that Apollo also might have had some choice words to say to Minos.\n\n \n\n\"Don't look that way,\" he warned the suitor. \"Icarus is the lover of the sun god Apollo. They have been together for over four years now. I don't need a plague upon my kingdom. And you don't want an early grave.\"\n\n \n\nThe suitor flinched away from Icarus, astonished.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo usually does not stay with his lovers long,\" he remarked.\n\n \n\nMinos snorted, \"Gods usually don't. But Icarus is special for some reason. Apollo even took pains to create a miraculous child with the bloodline of both Icarus and Apollo.\"\n\n \n\nAs the evening wore on, Icarus continued his duties, all the while keeping a close eye on the suitors. He knew he had a crucial role to play in protecting Ariadne, and he was determined to see it through.\n\n \n\nThe magic powder began its work. The first suitor, his eyes squinting, asked about Ariadne's age. Minos replied, \"Nineteen.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne had Icarus were the exact age. Ariadne having a few weeks on Icarus, a fact that she delighted in holding over his head when they were younger. Icarus fondly repressed a smile and an eyeroll as he recalled Ariadne insisting that he listen to her because she was older and thus wiser. That argument had not come to play since they had both turned twelve.\n\n \n\nThe suitor wrinkled his nose. \"Too old,\" he declared about Ariadne, though he himself was nearing fifty.\n\n \n\nThe other two joined the chorus, hemming and hawing. Judging a young woman's age when their hair had more white than black in it, wrinkles forrowed their faces and their bodies had grown thick from age and overindulgence.\n\n \n\n\"Agreed. Ariadne is past her prime. My father told me that young women birth sons and older women birth only useless daughters.\" Spoke the second suitor, puting his cup down.\n\n \n\nIcarus was tempted to ask in what scholarly trease this pearl of wisdom could be found. One of his neighbours, a lovely woman of thirty had birthed a healthy son only weeks ago. Icarus had send over well wishes from his household and a few toys made by Daedalus that Alexios had not found to his liking. He held his tongue. This was to save Ariadne from a horrible marriage. The huntresses, most likely eager, bloodthirsty Phoebe would avenge her honor from the insults of these louts.\n\n \n\nThe third suitor followed suit.\n\n \n\n\"Too old. And her mother is a goddess, making her a demigod. Demigod girls are wild and willful. Not the making of a proper dutiful and meek wife at all. We all know how Otrera's husband ended up.\"\n\n \n\nOtrera was a daughter of Ares, war and conflic in her blood. Magnificent woman no doubt, but very different from Ariadne and the way his friend was magnificent herself. Did these men not realise that each woman was different? They all had a distinct personality. Why did they insist on lumping women into narrow categories? The Olympian goddesses were the immortal proof of how different women could be from one another. And how complex. They all prayed in the temples and heard the priests speak of the goddesses and their deeds. Did the imparted knowledge just evaporate from their minds when they left the temple?\n\n \n\n\"Ariadne only nineteen, too old?\" Icarus seethed inwardly. His friend was vibrant, intelligent, and deserving of love. These men, blinded by vanity, couldn't see beyond their own repulsive desires, prejudices and selfishness.\n\n \n\nAs the night wore on, the suitors grew restless. Their gazes slid past Icarus, no longer hungry. The magic had worked--their repulsion toward Ariadne was palpable. Icarus's relief mingled with anger. They'd never court her now, but their insults stung. He restrained himself from taking them to task for their insults toward someone so dear to him.\n\n \n\nWhen the suitors departed, Minos clapped Icarus on the shoulder as if to console him. The king had definitely noticed that Icarus was displeased at the insults toward Ariadne. Icarus had to repress a sneer. If only Minos knew how much more Icarus had done.\n\n \n\n\"You've done well, my cupbearer,\" he said. \"Apollo's favor shines upon you.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus met the king's eyes. \"And Ariadne?\" he asked quietly.\n\n \n\nMinos's expression softened. \"She deserves better than those fools. Out of all my daughters she is the only one that has not shamed or defied me.\" he replied.\n\n \n\nOf course, Acacallis was exposed as being pregnant with Hermes' child and the god abandoned her without a single word. People had laughed at Minos when it was clear how little regard his godly half brother had for him.\n\n \n\nXenodice joined the priestesses of Artemis without her father's permission. No matter how much Minos disapproved, he could not drag his daughter out of Artemis' temple after Xenodice had spoken her vows and had been dedicated to the service fo the goddess. Icarus had been the one to sneak her out of the palace after receiving a message from the princess. Xenodice was now happy. Everytime Icarus visited Artemis' temple he saw Xenodice, the weight of her shoulders finally lifted and always with a happy smile as she diligently tended her duties.\n\n \n\nLittle Phaedra could be quite willful, having public tantrums that embarrassed Minos. The little girl had good reason to do so. Her father often spoke to her cruelly, making the little princess sad and angry.\n\n \n\n\"Perhaps the gods have other plans.\" Minos mused with a smile.\n\n \n\nThe wine the king had imbibed had put him in a rare good mood. No rages, no calling the guards, no threats of the Minotaur. Icarus looked at Minos's blue eyes, they almost seemed to have a purple tint around the edges of his iris. He was immediately suspicious, this smacked of a god's involvement. Apollo, while complaining about his youngest godly brother, had once commented that Dionysus had purple eyes. Something that Apollo seemed to find personally offensive and even hurtful for some reason. Icarus was aware that Apollo could not tell him everything, but it was one of the things that made him the most curious.\n\n \n\nWhy was Dionysus helping? Followers of Artemis were not liked by Dionysus since they eschewed everything that the wine god espoused. Still, Icarus was relieved. It would take a while before Minos scrounged up other suitors giving Pasiphae more time to find out and act.\n\n \n\nHe decided to slip into Dionysus' shrine and leave an offering. If the wine god was doing him and Ariadne a kindness, it was prudent to show gratitude, no matter his misgivings about Dionysus.~~~~~\n\n \n\nIn the sun-kissed land of Crete, where azure waves lapped against golden shores, Daedalus sat with his three year old grandson, Alexios. The boy's amber eyes sparkled with curiosity, and Daedalus knew it was time to share the ancient secrets of their island.\n\n \n\nIcarus would say that Alexios was too young and should just play with his toys or chase butterflies around the gardens but Daedalus knew better. Alexios was a demigod, the son of Apollo, the god of knowledge, reason, logic, rationality, poetry and music. So many intellectual domains from Alexios to inherit from.\n\n \n\nDaedalus had delayed Icarus' education and his darling boy had became much more interested in hunting beasts, monsters and dread sorcerors than anything scholarly. Daedalus would not repeat the mistake with Alexios, the younger he started the more interested he would stay in intellectual pursuits and not run about in dangerous quests with a priest of Hades!\n\n \n\n\"Listen well, Alexios,\" Daedalus began, his voice a gentle murmur.\n\n \n\n\"Before the days of grand sails and swift ships, Crete was a world apart. We were isolated, nestled amidst the vastness of the sea, our connection to distant lands tenuous.\"\n\n \n\nAlexios leaned closer, his small hands gripping the edge of Daedalus's chair.\n\n \n\n\"Why, Grandfather? Why were we so alone?\"\n\n \n\n\"Ah, we are too far away from everyone else, and surrounded by grand and rough seas,\" Daedalus smiled, \"that's where our gods came into play. Poseidon, the mighty sea god, was our protector. His bounty sustained us--fishermen cast their nets, and sailors rowed their wooden ships, seeking sustenance from the waves. Demeter as well was just has honored here as the mightly god of the seas.\"\n\n \n\n\"But what about Demeter?\" Alexios interrupted, his eyes wide. \"Why did we worship her so much?\"\n\n \n\n\"Demeter,\" Daedalus said, \"is the goddess of harvest and fertility. Our fields yielded golden wheat and plump fruit, but we needed her favor to ensure abundant crops. We offered her prayers and sacrifices, for a hungry land is a desperate one.\"\n\n \n\n\"But then,\" Alexios leaned even closer, \"what changed, Grandfather?\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus's gaze turned distant, recalling the pivotal moment.\n\n \n\n\"It was Princess Europa, my boy. Zeus, the king of the gods, transformed into a magnificent bull and carried her across the sea to our shores. Europa bore three sons--Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon--gifts from the divine.\"\n\n \n\nWith a smile, Daedalus kissed Alexios' golden curls.\n\n \n\n\"Just like you are a divine gift from Apollo to your Tata. The best and greatest blessing that Apollo has given Icarus.\"\n\n \n\n\"But Zeus left Europa,\" Alexios said, his voice tinged with sadness.\n\n \n\n\"Yes,\" Daedalus nodded. \"Zeus vanished out of the blue, leaving Europa alone. But she was no ordinary mortal. She knew that without Zeus she could not return to her own land, and as a foreigner with three little sons she would have a rough life. There is Hera's wrath to consider as well. Gods typically stay their hands with kings and queens.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus paused to look in the direction of Knossos, where the old palace had stood, before Daedalus himself had built a better one for Minos.\n\n \n\n\" Clever and resourceful, Europa won the heart of King Asterion. They married to the astonishment of the Cretan nobility, and he adopted her sons as his own. Minos and his brothers went from the sons of an unmarried foreign woman to the princes of the land. Asterion did not have children of his own blood, not even with a wife whose fertility was beyond doubt. He named Minos his heir, to be king after his passing.\"\n\n \n\n\"And Minos?\" Alexios asked, eyes wide.\n\n \n\n\"Minos,\" Daedalus continued, \"became our king. He mourned Asterion's passing but feared his brothers. Rhadamanthus and Sarpedon were strong, ambitious. So Minos banished them from Crete, ensuring his rule.\"\n\n \n\n\"But what about Zeus?\" Alexios pressed.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus's legacy lived on,\" Daedalus said. \"For I, Daedalus, your grandfather, invented sails that transformed our ships. No more endless and slow moving rowing to move the ships. With these new vessels, we sailed swiftly far and wide, trading with distant lands. Crete grew wealthy, challenging mainland kingdoms.\"\n\n \n\n\"But not everyone liked the changes,\" Alexios said, sensing the tension, a hint of his father's knowledge shining in his amber eyes.\n\n \n\n\"No,\" Daedalus agreed, delighted with his grandson's quick and clever mind. He was right to start Alexios' education early. The child would definitely getting some new toys for being such a delight to teach!\n\n \n\n\"Some longed for the old ways--the simplicity, the quiet. They feared the influx of demigods, the constant movement. But Minos, he devoted himself to Zeus, building temples to him and the other gods, and honoring our divine lineage.\"\n\n\"And what happened next?\" Alexios whispered.\n\n \n\nDaedalus leaned closer, his voice a secret shared between generations.\n\n \n\n\"Crete thrives, but shadows gather. Monsters stirr, drawn by our demigods. And so, my dear Alexios, our island dances on the edge of fate--a place of wealth, ambition, and ancient gods.\"\n\n \n\nAnd as the sun dipped below the horizon, Daedalus's tale wove its magic, binding the past to the present, and young Alexios dreamed of sails billowing against cerulean skies, carrying them toward destiny. He sees his beloved Tata, with his eyes closed, staying very still in the waters. Then a girl, with green eyes, but looking just like Tata, emerge from the sea, wearing strange clothing and run toward a boy in the sunlit shore that looks like Alexios but bigger, older. He has green eyes too. The sun shines upon them both, embracing them in warmth and light.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nDaedalus, the craftsman and inventor revered across all the lands of Hellas, now found himself reluctantly hosting his estranged half-brother, Alkinoos, another son of Athena. Alkinoos has decided to visit Crete and of course sought the brother already established there.\n\n \n\nThe rift between them had deep roots--Daedalus's banishment from Athens for the tragic death of his nephew, Talos. Athena, his mother, had turned her back on him, and now fate had brought Alkinoos to his doorstep. Daedalus did not like his half-brother's presence. The very sight of Alkinoos caused him a strange anxiety. Unfortunately, Daedalus could not turn him away as his instincts screamed him to.\n\n \n\nCrete, where Daedalus resided, lay firmly under the rule of Zeus. Xenia--the sacred law of hospitality--compelled him to receive Alkinoos graciously.Failure to do so would bring the divine wrath of the king of the gods upon Daedalus, his family and his household.\n\n \n\nSo, with a heavy heart, Daedalus welcomed his unexpected guest. The two had a meal of wine, flatbreads, good cheese, olives and grapes in the in the luxurious receiving room before Daedalus showed his half-brother around his fine home. Alkinoos could see the testament to how well Daedalus had done for himself and his family since being cast out of Athens. No one could deny that banishment had been very generous to the inventor. In Crete, Daedalus' imagination and ingenuity had reached untold hights. Minos could be difficult, but there was no overly demanding godly mother, neglectful mortal father, hateful stepmother or resentful half-siblings to cause Daedalus excessive stress.\n\n \n\nThe grand mansion, adorned with opulence, stood as a testament to Daedalus's artistry. As Alkinoos stepped inside, his eyes widened, devouring the fine tapestries, luxurious furnishings, and intricate mosaics. Statues of gods and heroes lined the corridors, their marble forms frozen in eternal grace.\n\n \n\n\"Your son, Icarus,\" Alkinoos said, gesturing at the animal skins that lined the carved wooden couches, benches, chairs, and stools in the receiving room, Daedalus's work room, the beds in the guest rooms, and even the marble benches on the veranda.\n\n \n\n\"He's the one who collected all these glorious animal pelts?\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus nodded, pride swelling within him.\n\n \n\n\"Indeed. Icarus hunts the beasts himself, ensuring our comfort and warmth. Keeps our bellies full with meat too.\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos's gaze shifted to the tapestries. \"And these? Gifts from royalty?\"\n\n \n\n\"Queen Pasiphae and her daughter, Princess Ariadne,\" Daedalus replied.\n\n \n\n\"Ariadne, my student, wove these intricate scenes. Her mathematical prowess elevated the patterns.\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos's disdain was evident. \"A girl? Educated by you?\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus's eyes flashed, displeased at the slight of his prized and attentive student. Who cared if she was a girl? She was gifted like few were. Icarus had been right to demand that the princess join th lessons.\n\n \n\n\"Ariadne's mind is as sharp as any man's. She weaves tales of gods and mortals, capturing their essence. She is also of great help whenever I build a new temple. She takes care of our allotted budget, ensuring that we get the full worth of every bit of silver and gold. Icarus ensures that the merchands do not cheat us and the workers are diligent. I have been able to construct extra shrines with the gold left over from her tight accounting.\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos wisely chose to stay quiet and make no more comments about the princess.\n\n \n\nThey moved to the mosaic-adorned atrium.\n\n \n\n\"And these?\" Alkinoos asked, pointing at the intricate floor designs.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" Daedalus said, his voice softer and a bit cooler.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus's lover of four years now. The sun god gifted these mosaics and statues to our household--a tribute to our shared lineage.\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos raised an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo stays with Icarus for years? Unusual for him. I have lost track of how many broken hearts he has spread around Athens. Not in the last four to five years though.\"\n\n \n\n\"Indeed,\" Daedalus replied recalling all too well when he heard the rumours of his fifteen year old son being wooed by the sun god. Or when he caught the two of them in the garden as Apollo taught Icarus the lyre. Or the far too many times he had spied the sun god leave his son's bedroom at dawn. Not for the first time he wished that Icarus had taken more after him instead of inheriting Naucrate's flawless and aesthetic features.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo's love usually wanes swiftly, and he is gone in the blink of an eye. But Icarus--my sweet, beloved son--holds him fast like no one else.\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos leaned closer.\n\n \n\n\"Except for Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta, right? Apollo mourned him so deely and fiercely for decades. Sparta still holds that festival every year at Apollo's insistence a century after.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus's heart clenched. \"Yes, Hyacinthus--the tragically dead prince. Apollo's grief lingers.\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos studied Daedalus. \"And your grandson? Icarus's child?\"\n\n \n\n\"Three years old,\" Daedalus said. \"A demigod, born of Apollo's touch. Beautiful, healthy and clever child.\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos's eyes narrowed. \"Are you afraid? That Icarus will meet the same fate as the prince?\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus's voice dropped and he glared at his half-brother. Apollo's enduring love boded enough ill for Icarus without people tempting the Fates further!\n\n \n\n\"Fear gnaws at me yes. I want to destroy everyone that hints at the fates of Apollo's lovers. But Xenia binds us. Alkinoos, tread carefully. Be a proper guest and don't wish ill luck upon my son.\"\n\n \n\nAs if summoned by their words, Icarus entered, cradling Alexios. Alkinoos could not help but stare in openmouthed astonishment--Icarus was beauty incarnate. The only comparison would be the statues of Prince Hyacinthus at Apollo's sanctuary in Sparta. Icarus's disdainful look at the admiring stare silenced any further comments.\n\n \n\nThey settled at the table. Alexios, playful and giggly, declared his disdain for olives. Icarus chuckled.\n\n \n\n\"Bitter, yes. But they make you strong. You have to eat them. I don't like them either but I still ate them every day.\"\n\n \n\nAlexios pouted but ate an olive, eyes wide with defiance. His father laughed and to appease his little son, ate an olive himself. Encouraged Alexios ate another one before switching to sweet grapes and flatbread softened with milk.\n\n \n\nAlkinoos watched the little boy, his gray eyes calculating. His gaze shifted to the crimson walls of the dinning hall--the expensive dye that also graced the walls of King Minos palace, a symbol of Daedalus's pride and pain. The undeniable proof of his vast wealth.\n\n \n\n\"Daedalus,\" Alkinoos said, voice low. \"Apollo's love may burn, but your grandson--\"\n\n \n\n\"--is more than a flame,\" Daedalus interrupted. \"He's a legacy--the sun-kissed child of my son's blood and Apollo's ichor. Alexios will be master of this house after Icarus.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, in the opulent halls of Daedalus's mansion, a mysterious grey eyed and ambitious stranger now resided.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nDays passed, and Daedalus and his son, Icarus, escorted Alkinoos to King Minos's grand feast. The palace shimmered with opulence, its marble floors echoing the footsteps of gods and mortals alike. Minos celebrated the birthday of his son, Deucalion, a prince destined for greatness as the future king of Crete.\n\n \n\nAlkinoos wandered, drawn to a hushed gathering of elderly noblemen. Their eyes, like ancient constellations, bore witness to forgotten truths. They remembered the old regime, the royal bloodline that had ruled Crete since Prometheus stole fire from Olympus to give to mortals, allowing for civilization to rise. They regarded the festivities and the king's family with disdain--their loyalty to tradition warring with the winds of change. They wanted the old times, where landowners were much greatly regarded than merchants with many sailed ships. They glared at Daedalus, the inventor of sails with as much disdain as they did upon Minos, the bastard son of the foreign woman who seduced their last true king.\n\n \n\nIcarus, ever loyal, settled beside Princess Ariadne. Their friendship transcended courtly boundaries, and he reveled in her laughter. But Deucalion, the prince with eyes like storm clouds, chose to join them. His presence shifted the air, and Icarus sensed a hidden current beneath the surface.\n\n \n\nIdle talk flowed like wine. Deucalion leaned toward Icarus, curiosity and something else etching lines on his brow.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" he said, voice low, \"are you still connected to him?\"\n\n \n\nIcarus hesitated, then met Deucalion's gaze. \"We are together,\" he confessed, heart pounding. Ariadne echoed the truth, her eyes dancing with worry and unease as she looked between her brother by blood and the brother of her heart.\n\n \n\nDeucalion's disappointment was palpable. He excused himself, leaving Icarus bewildered. Why would Apollo's relationship matter to him? The answer lay in Ariadne's knowing look--a secret shared between friends.\n\n \n\nLater, in the moon-kissed courtyard as they took a break from the noise made by drunken revelers, Ariadne informed the gloomy Icarus who had been glaring jealously at Deucalion through the feast. Thinking that the prince was enamoured with Apollo.\n\n \n\n\"You're dense, my friend,\" she chided. \"Deucalion's heart doesn't orbit Apollo. It circles you.\"Icarus stumbled, uncomprehending. \"Me? But--\"\n\n \n\n\"You,\" Ariadne said, \"has held Deucalion's gaze for years. He hoped Apollo would tire of you, but love is stubborn.\" She touched Icarus's cheek. \"He wants you, my brother but can't even approach you while you belong to Apollo.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne sipped her wine as she glanced at her stupefied best friend.\n\n \n\n\"My brother is not the only one. Quite a lot of men and women have been enchanted with you since you turned fifteen. You did not even notice. Apollo did and acted accordingly.\"\n\n \n\n\"Accordingly?\" Asked Icarus.\n\n \n\nAriadne nodded as the wine in her cup swirled and thrashed almost violently despite her holding the cup very still.\n\n \n\n\"Never wise to crave what belongs to a god. Apollo is quite jealous. The ones that listened and stopped even looking at you were spared but the few stubborn ones did not fare so well.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nModern times:\n\n \n\nPercy Jackson, daughter of Poseidon, bore the weight of her past lives--their memories etched like constellations across her soul. She had been Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta, whose beauty had stirred Apollo's heart. And then Icarus, the youth blackmailed by the Fates themselves to fly too close to the sun. They had given him no choice. Apollo dared to defy them. Anyone who defied the Fates must fall. Unless someone willingly chose to take the fall for them.\n\n \n\nApollo, the sun god, had loved her twice already. In each incarnation, their passion blazed--a celestial fire that transcended time. But love was a cruel tapestry, woven with threads of longing and tragedy. She did not know what the Fates had in store for them this time. Percy could feel the red string connecting her heart to Apollo's, looped around her neck, tightening.\n\n \n\nWhen Percy remembered, the memories flooded her--a Spartan prince's laughter, the taste of salt on Icarus's lips. She carried their essence within her, a legacy of gods and mortals entwined. And Apollo, relentless in his pursuit, had created a child--a son named Willam--while searching for her. The Fates were such trolls to make her a girl this time. Apollo must have checked every boy born under the sun, but had not thought to check the girls. What a perfect smokescreen, Percy had to give it to the dread triplets.\n\n \n\nPoseidon, her father, did not react well. His sea-green eyes blazed with fury.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" he spat, \"chooses to obsess over my bloodlines. His love is a curse.\"\n\n \n\nPercy held her son, Will Solace, close. Alexios had been his name before--a child of sun and water, just like he was now. Losing him had shattered Icarus in a way the fall from the sky hadn't. She understood now as the memories flooded in every minute--the agony of loving something death could touch.\n\n \n\n\"Father,\" Percy said, keeping her voice steady even though she wanted to weep and scream. But someone had to stay calm. Poseidon was reacting enough for the two of them, \"no one chooses to fall in love. It binds us, defying reason and fate. There is nothing more horrible than loving something death can touch.\"\n\n \n\nShe shuddered at her own words, remembering Hyacinthus's blood staining the earth, Icarus's feathers aflame. She recalled Apollo's sobs and howls of agony each time. Daedalus' screams of despair, his pleading to any god who would listen. The only one who had a vested interest in keeping Icarus alive was Apollo. Him, the fates bound with threads, forcing him to watch from his chariot, unable to do anything. Still better than them throwing him in Tartarus.\n\n \n\nApollo, watched his uncle rage silently, letting Percy defend him. His golden eyes held regret--the weight of eternity. He had loved her twice before and now again, and each time, tragedy followed. But gods were not immune to heartache. Yet, he desperately hoped that this time would be different, that he would succeed in keeping her alive this time. Long enough to feed her one of the golden apples of immortality or have her drink from Ganymede's chalice.\n\n \n\nReach sixteen against all odds, little Della had spoken then. He could not risk going against the Fates again, but he would act the moment she hit sixteen. No asking for permissions from Zeus and Hera. They had the chance to give him what he wanted the most but they had as always disappointed him.\n\n \n\nPercy whispered to Will, \"If love were a choice, no god would willingly fall for a mortal.\" She kissed his forehead, feeling the pulse of both sun and sea--the legacy of gods and their mortal creations.And so, in the quiet of their mortal existence, Percy vowed to protect her son. She would break the cycle, rewrite the stars. For love, even when touched by death, was the only magic worth fighting for.\n\n \n\nAnd then, Poseidon's rant was interrupted by the arrival of an ugly man she didn't know and a very familiar centaur. The ugly middle aged man in a leopard print shirt stumbled in, appearing to be in desperate need of a drink. Percy grimaced in distaste, reminded of Smelly Gabe, her despised mortal stepfather.\n\n \n\n\"Ah, the drama of love,\" the man slurred. \"Makes me want to dance on grapevines.\"Percy had no idea who he was, so she chose to ignore him.\n\n \n\nIt was Chiron who caught Percy's attention. She recognized him from her life as Hyacinthus--the centaur who had trained her at his camp. Those six months had been grueling, filled with archery lessons and herbal lore. Chiron was no easy mentor. He was also lax with the discipline of Zeus's vile brats.\n\n \n\n\"Percy,\" Chiron said, his eyes kinder now, \"you've have reached Camp. I am glad that I did not waste my time.\"\n\n \n\nPercy, Will, Apollo and Poseidon glared at the Chiron. Percy raised her eyebrows.\n\n \n\n\"So you wouldn't have cared if I had died on my way here? Do you have the same policy for all other demigods that are chased by monsters here?\"\n\n \n\nChiron chose not to answer as Apollo and Poseidon continued to glare at him\n\n \n\nShe squared her shoulders. \"Chiron,\" she said, \"do you have the sons of Zeus under control, or am I going to pull a Smilax? I will give you 24 hours before I take matters into my own hands. I might not have her skills at persuasion but I can control water. A substance that can be found everywhere and no one can live without it.\"\n\n \n\nChiron looked pained and he hesitated briefly before he spoke. \"There have been no sons of Zeus since the oath,\" he replied.\n\n \n\nPercy frowned. \"What oath?\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon shifted uncomfortably, avoiding her gaze, looking almost ashamed so Apollo stepped forward.\n\n \n\n\"After World War II,\" he explained, \"the three sons of Rhea--Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades--swore an oath on the Styx. No more demigod children.\"\n\n \n\n\"But I exist,\" Percy pointed out, eyeing Poseidon with disbelief and a bit of anger. \"How is that possible?\"\n\n \n\nApollo's gaze held sorrow.\n\n \n\n\"Oaths on the Styx can be broken,\" he said. \"But those who do so condemn their demigod children to terrible fates. Poseidon just told me that the day after you were born, descended to the underworld and drank from the Styxto protect you from the consequences. The eldest Oceanid was unable to send hordes of monsters against you, like she did it for poor Thalia Grace.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's curiosity flared. \"Who is Thalia Grace?\"\n\n \n\nThe unknown ugly man answered-- Thalia was the daughter of Zeus and a mortal actress named Beryl Grace. Zeus broke the oath, unable to resist her charms. Thalia's life was a torment--chased by monsters, she sacrificed herself to save her friends. Zeus transformed her into a pine tree, reinforcing the camp's barriers.\n\n \n\nPercy noted that the pine was Poseidon's sacred tree, not Zeus's. Poseidon believed Zeus did it to spare him from harming Thalia. After all, their camp stood by the sea.\n\n \n\nPercy vaguely recalled the actress Beryl Grace. She tended to take note of blonde people. Galaxaura had a file of newspaper and magazine clipings on the actress. It documented the birth of her children. A daughter and Jason Grace, the missing 2 year old. Percy recalled that Beryl had gotten drunk and misplaced her son. Her own daughter had called the cops on her. Beryl had insisted that she was innocent but her daughter accused her of selling out Jason to save her own skin. The daughter had vanished after and Beryl Grace dried while driving drunk.\n\n \n\nPercy looked at the strange man, he was not a demigod. By his aura, he was a god, but not one she had ever met in all her lives.\n\n \n\n\"Sorry, but who are you?\" She asked him.The man looked offended.\n\n \n\n\"I am Dionysus, god of wine, the twelfth Olympian! I hate how the world is, a demigod girl can't even recognize me!\"\n\n \n\n\"Isn't that Lady Hestia?\" Percy asked.\n\n \n\n\"Not anymore I took her place among the Twelve!\" Dionysus shot back.\n\n \n\n\"You usurped Hestia? Hestia?\" Percy gasped in astonishment.\n\n \n\n\"Did that Late Bronze Age collapse happen because Hearth and Home were replaced by Wine and Madness?\" Percy could not help but ask\n\n \n\nDionysus hissed, his eyes glowing an ominous purple.\n\n \n\n\"Everyone blames me for that!\" He snarled.\n\n \n\n\"But it was you! Icarus's death caused the Ancient Dark Age,\" Dionysus sneered. \"Apollo's domains went haywire because he went mad with grief at losing you for a second time. Why were you so reckless during that flight!\"\n\n \n\nPercy turned to Apollo, astonished. His stubborn gaze held no remorse.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" Apollo began, turning to his half-brother, \"Had been cursed at birth to die young. We have no idea who did it. I tried to circumvent the threads but the Fates worked against me. Don't blame Percy for it. Icarus was not at fault. The only one at fault was the god who cast the curse!\"\n\n \n\nApollo's eyes glowed a dangerous, bright gold. Percy immediately shielded Will's eyes. As a daughter of one of the most powerful three she had a certain resistance to godly glow, but she was not sure how much Will did and was not willing to take chances. Poseidon tightened his hold on his trident, Percy felt the sea began to rage with her father. Dionysus looked astonished by this revelation.\n\n \n\n\"When I find out who was responsible I will...!\" Hissed Apollo, sounding too much serpentine.\n\n \n\nPercy unfortunately could picture it how after Icarus's tragic demise, Apollo unraveled. His domains--music, prophecy, healing, logic, reason--went haywire, shaking the very foundations of existence. And thus began the unraveling--the Late Bronze Age Collapse that shattered empires and civilizations.\n\n \n\n\"But the Trojan War,\" Will interjected, his voice clear. Driven to defend his parents, the sweet child.\n\n \n\n\"It played a role too. Dad didn't start that one. He fought against the Greeks to defend Troy, but he had no part in how it began.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's gaze shifted to Apollo. Her godly beloved remained unrepentant. Empathy was a mortal trait, and gods were distant and detached, their hearts as unyielding as marble statues. Apollo had tried, he had tried so hard--for Hyacinthus, for Icarus--but he never quite got it right. He could empathize with the pain of those he loved, but hardly anyone else. Hyacinthus and Icarus had never held it against him. Apollo was not human, they could not expect him to react like one. Percy searched her feelings and found that she didn't either.\n\n \n\nShe recalled Clio, her first mother whispering a secret to her, back when she had been a son of History, a Prince of Sparta.\n\n \n\n\"Loyalty. Personal loyalty. I fear that is your fatal flaw my darling child. Beware, it is very dangerous. Especially in a leader. Check yourself. Don't allow it to drive you off a cliff.\"\n\nThat one writing workshop I attended years ago advised that we kill our darlings. I am having lots of trouble doing so.\n\nAlso, has anyone caught the hints on who has noticed who?\n\nAlkinoos tries to be Littlefinger.\n\nHermes gives Apollo some really bad news. Chloris has a very bad day.\n\nPercy's first day at camp.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nIn the sun-drenched halls of Knossos, Alkinoos, son of Athena, mingled with the old Cretan nobility. His lineage was a tapestry woven with threads of divinity and mortal blood. Alkinoos, brother to the famed inventor Daedalus and uncle to the ill-fated Icarus, moved gracefully through the crowd, his silver eyes catching glimpses of whispered secrets and hidden alliances.\n\n \n\nOne evening, as the wine flowed freely and the torches flickered, Alkinoos found himself in conversation with an elderly landowning nobleman named Eurytion. The old man's gnarled hands traced patterns on his chiton as he spoke, revealing tales of a bygone era--the remnants of the old regime that clung stubbornly to their memories.\n\n \n\n\"Daedalus,\" Eurytion spat the name like a curse, \"that wretched inventor! His sails have brought ruin upon Crete. We were once isolated, our island kingdom untouched by the mainland and distant realms. But now, thanks to him, we are connected--bound by threads of wind and sea. Knossos, Holy Knossos is overrun by foreigners that know nothing of our ways! Of our ancient history!\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos leaned in, intrigued. \"Connected? Surely that is a boon. Trade, knowledge, adventure--all flow through these newfound channels.\"\n\n \n\nEurytion's eyes narrowed.\n\n \n\n\"Boon or bane, it matters not. The old ways crumble. Daedalus's sails have shattered our isolation. We are no longer masters of our own fate.\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos chuckled.\n\n \n\n\"You underestimate my brother's genius. According to Athenian records, Daedalus completed the initial sail design when he was but twelve years old. He had tinkered with rudimentary sails before, fashioning them for himself. But it was the first sailboat--the one he guided around Attica under the watchful gaze of King Aegeus--that cemented his reputation.\"\n\n \n\nEurytion's brow furrowed.\n\n \n\n\"Genius, you say? Perhaps he is more than mortal. Is Daedalus just a demigod? Could Hephaestus be his true father? That Athenian king Erichthonius was son to both Athena and Hephaestus.\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos hesitated. He had told Eurytion the truth--the secrets merely whispered in the sacred groves of Athena. Daedalus was not merely a product of Hephaestus's bloodline. He was a brainchild of the goddess herself, Athena's gift to mortals with worthy minds. But such knowledge was perilous beyond the divine and part-divine circles. Eurytion had some suspicions to begin with, all Alkinoos had to do was confirm them. The elderly nobleman had no love for demigods, but Alkinoos and his siblings possessed not powers, just their minds. Eurytion was convinced that unlike other demigods, begat in normal ways Alkinoos and Daedalus did not draw in monsters.\n\n \n\n\"No,\" Alkinoos replied carefully. \"Daedalus is descended from Hephaestus, like all Athenians of royal lineage. His mortal father was the late Athenian prince Metion.\"\n\n \n\nEurytion leaned closer, eyes searching. \"And Athena? Is she not his true mother?\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos shook his head. He had already explained it but the stubborn old mortal still had trouble grasping the concept. But for some reason Eurytion and the others had no trouble grasping that little Alexios was the son of Apollo and Icarus, two men, no woman involved. Alkinoos suspected that creating the little demigod had not just involved mixing Icarus' blood with Apollo's ichor but he was not trusted in the household to ask such questions.\n\n \n\n\"Athena's role is more intricate. Daedalus embodies her wisdom, her ingenuity. He is a mind-child, born of inspiration and mortal hands. But the world outside our sacred circle cannot fathom such creations. If anyone claimed to be Athena's son, they would be branded a liar or worse--blasphemous. We all know what happens to blasphemers.\"\n\n \n\nEurytion's gaze lingered on Alkinoos. A smug and rather knowing smile in his furrowed, ancient face.\n\n \n\n\"And what of you, son of Athena? What secrets do you carry?\"\n\n \n\nAlkinoos smiled, deflecting the question. He had a lot of practice with that lately, needing to avoid the god of truth. A difficult task given that Apollo visited Icarus almost daily. As inconvenient as that was, Alkinoos could not blame the god. The boy was stunningly beautiful, truly the son of a nymph. If it werent for the fact that Icarus and Daedalus had identical scowls and the same withering glare, Alkinoos would believe that the late Naucrate had been disloyal.\n\n \n\n\"My secrets are woven into the fabric of the winds, old friend. Let Daedalus bear the weight of invention. As for Athena, her reputation remains untarnished.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, in the flickering torchlight, Alkinoos danced on the edge of truth, guarding the delicate balance between gods and mortals. Daedalus's sails may have bridged kingdoms, but it was the unspoken knowledge--the divine spark--that truly connected their worlds.\n\n \n\nAnd in that moment, Alkinoos wondered if perhaps the greatest inventions were not of wood and canvas, but of stories whispered across generations, binding gods and men alike. He preened a bit, imagining his tale being told many generations after his passing.\n\n \n\nBut Alkinoos had another purpose--a delicate web to weave. Daedalus introduced him as a cousin, not a brother. Their shared gray eyes concealed their bond, but Alkinoos needed more. Icarus, Apollo's lover, danced with fate. His early demise would surprise no one. Alkinoos had seen people glance at Icarus with pity as if seeing death. Even Daedalus' head maidservant looked at the young man af if planning his funeral linens.\n\n \n\nYet Alkinoos faced an obstacle--the three-year-old Alexios, son of Icarus and Apollo. Apollo's children thrived. Alexios, a special demigod, stood in Alkinoos's path. He must keep his hands clean. Apollo would take terrible wroth and harshly punish the one responsible. Alkinoos could not be in any way involved. But there were plenty of paranoid fools who wanted demigods gone, afraid of the monsters that they drew in. As if monsters would not happily attack and devour regular mortals if demigods could not be had.\n\n \n\nEurytion despised powerful demigods in particular due to Minos and his brothers. Alkinoos chose his words carefully, bragging about Alexios's healing touch, the sunlight conjured to mend Icarus's wounds after he returned from the woods with a large and fearsome beast. Fear would guide Eurytion's hand. Alexios was exceptional for a three year old demigod. Age would only make him stronger. Herakles after all strangled serpents in his cradle. Now the famous demigod strangled drakons.\n\n \n\nAnd so, in the torchlight's flicker, Alkinoos spun his tale--a delicate balance of truth and omission, gods and mortals. Daedalus's sails bridged kingdoms, but Alkinoos wove destinies, pulling threads of fate to suit his purpose.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIn the celestial halls of Olympus, Hermes, the fleet-footed messenger, approached Apollo. The sun god stood radiant, his golden lyre forgotten, as Hermes leaned in, whispering secrets carried by the winds.\n\n \n\n\"Brother,\" Hermes began, \"I overheard a tale whispered in the winds--a thread of fate that binds your heart.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's eyes narrowed in alarm and a sense of foreboding curling unpleasantly in his gut.\n\n \n\n\"Speak, Hermes. What gossip dances on the breeze?\"\n\n \n\n\"It concerns Icarus,\" Hermes said, voice hushed. \"Your lover of four years, yet more than mortal. He is Hyacinthus reborn--the Spartan prince whose fate was once entwined with yours.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's breath caught at the reminder. Hyacinthus--the youth whose blood stained the earth, whose death birthed the hyacinth flower. Apollo had mourned him until he found Icarus. His beloved, reborn, the same yet different. But the loss of the first incarnation would never, never stop hurting. When he cradled Hyacinthus' dead and bloody body in his arms Apollo new what pain, suffering and grief truly were.\n\n \n\n\"But there's more,\" Hermes continued. \"Icarus bears a curse--a shadow cast at his birth by a god. He is destined to die young. I don't know who cast that curse. I have been looking into it but absolutely no luck so far.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's heart thundered. \"No! Not again. I cannot lose him.\"\n\n \n\nDesperation etched Apollo's features. He envisioned Icarus's laughter, the warmth of their shared nights, their sweet kisses, the way Icarus looked at Apollo, eyes glowing with love. To lose him twice--the thought was unbearable.\n\n \n\n\"I'll go to the garden of Hesperides,\" Apollo declared, picking up his bow.\n\n \n\n\"I'll pluck a golden apple--the fruit of immortality--to feed Icarus. It will defy fate.\"\n\n \n\nHermes shook his head, his blue eyes shining with pity rather than the usual mischief.\n\n \n\n\"Heracles, our demigod half-brother, has been there, brother. His Eleventh Labor led him to those sacred trees. Eurystheus demanded golden apples from him. Heracles somehow tricked Atlas into fetching ten apples--the entire harvest for this century. It will take another before the next batch are ripe.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's hope waned. \"Then where are those apples now? The ones Herakles obtained?\"\n\n \n\n\"Hera confiscated them,\" Hermes revealed.\n\n \n\n\"King Eurystheus never tasted their sweetness. But fear not, Apollo. There's another path.\"\n\n \n\n\"The Chalice of the Gods,\" Apollo whispered, utterly disgusted. It was that chalice that had transformed Eros' wife into a goddess. The loathsome winged monster was just handed the chalice, so he could keep his beloved forever. But Apollo was denied the same. He had gone through the proper channels to secure Hyacinthus godhood but had been denied. Zeus claimed that Apollo would stop loving his beloved prince and Hera had been afraid that a loving marriage would make her own even more of a joke.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus's vessel of ambrosia--the elixir of immortality.\" Apollo continued, hope making his eyes glow.\n\n \n\nHermes grinned with delight.\n\n \n\n\"Indeed. But beware. I once tried to pilfer it for fun. Zeus added protections against me. Ganymede guards it fiercely, for Hebe often seeks its touch.\"\n\n \n\nApollo clenched his fists.\n\n \n\n\"I'll face Ganymede. I'll drink from the chalice and share it with Icarus. We'll defy the curse.\"\n\n \n\nHermes touched Apollo's shoulder.\n\n \n\n\"Remember, brother, love transcends even the gods. But tread carefully--the threads of fate are delicate, and the winds carry both whispers and warnings.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, Apollo set forth, heart aflame. He would brave the heavens, confront Ganymede, and claim the Chalice of the Gods. For love--whether mortal or divine--demanded defiance, even against destiny itself.\n\n \n\nApollo, the radiant sun god, stood atop Mount Olympus, his golden chariot blazing across the sky. His heart weighed heavy with the news from Hermes--the prophecy that foretold Icarus's untimely demise. Icarus, Apollo's beloved mortal lover, was fated to die young, cursed by some ancient god at the moment of his birth.\n\n \n\nDetermined to defy destiny, Apollo sought a way to grant Icarus eternal life. His only hope lay in the legendary Chalice of the Gods, said to hold the elixir of immortality. But this sacred vessel was guarded by none other than Ganymede, the cupbearer of Olympus.\n\n \n\nApollo descended from the heavens, his fiery eyes fixed on Ganymede. The young cupbearer trembled as the sun god approached. Apollo's presence was both awe-inspiring and terrifying--a force that could shape destinies and shatter worlds. The former Prince of Troy was well aware that Apollo was not fond of him. Ganymede had been given what Hyacinthus had been denied. While Apollo did not hate Ganymede as much as he hated Psyche, the cupbearer avoided being in the sun god's presence as much as he could.\n\n \n\n\"Give me the Chalice,\" Apollo demanded, his voice echoing through the marble halls of Olympus. \"I must save Icarus.\"\n\n \n\nGanymede bowed, his hands trembling. \"My lord, I would gladly yield the Chalice to you. But fate has intervened. It is no longer in my possession.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's anger flared. \"What do you mean? Where is it?\"\n\n \n\nGanymede hesitated, then spoke softly, as if afraid of being overheard.\n\n \n\n\"The Fates themselves summoned Zeus to their hidden lair. They asked the king of the gods to entrust the Chalice to their care--for a time. Zeus, though reluctant, yielded to their request.\"\n\n \n\nApollo clenched his fists. The Fates--the weavers of destiny--held the Chalice now. Their threads spanned past, present, and future, and their decisions were irrevocable. He knew their power well.\n\n \n\n\"Why?\" Apollo's voice cracked. \"Why would the Fates take the Chalice?\"\n\n \n\nGanymede lowered his gaze desperate to quell Apollo's rage.\n\n \n\n\"They guard it until they decide its purpose. Perhaps they see a greater design, a cosmic balance that even immortality disrupts. I do not know my lord.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's mind raced. He had no sway over the Fates, no bargaining power. But Icarus's face haunted him--the mortal who danced too close to the sun, who dared to soar on waxen wings. Apollo's love for Icarus transcended eternity. This was the second time he loved Icarus' soul. As the God of Prophecy, Apollo knew that he would love Hyacinthus and his second incarnation Icarus for all eternity.\n\n \n\n\"Tell me,\" Apollo said, desperation in his eyes. \"When will they return the Chalice?\"\n\n \n\nGanymede shook his head, looking as if he desperately wished to flee.\n\n \n\n\"Only the Fates know. Until then, it remains in their hands.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, Apollo stood on Olympus, torn between love and duty. The Chalice--the key to Icarus's salvation--was beyond his reach. He vowed to watch over Icarus, to shield him from harm until fate's threads unraveled once more. He would not allow Icarus to die. The Fates would have to take a loss this time.\n\n \n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, Apollo whispered a prayer to the Fates. \"Grant me my desire, weavers of destiny. Stay your scissors. For love knows no bounds, and I will not let him die.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, the Chalice of Immortality rested in the hands of the Fates, its golden glow hidden from all eyes. Until the day they deemed it otherwise, it would remain their hands--a beacon of hope in a world where gods and mortals danced on the edge of eternity.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nIn the shadowed recesses of the cosmic tapestry, the three sisters--the Fates--sat huddled around their loom. Their fingers danced across the threads of existence, weaving destinies with the precision of eternity. Clotho spun the threads of birth, Lachesis measured the span of life, and Atropos wielded the shears of death.\n\n \n\nBut today, their loom trembled, the threads swaying. Apollo, the god of prophecy, had dared to defy their will. His love for Icarus--the mortal who danced too close to the sun--had ignited a rebellion against the very fabric of fate.\n\n \n\n\"Look,\" Atropos hissed, her eyes ablaze.\"Apollo descends to the mortal realm, laying blessings upon blessings upon Icarus. Health, longevity, improved healing rate, immunity to disease and posion. He seeks to alter the course of destiny.\"\n\n \n\nLachesis frowned. \"Icarus was once Prince Hyacinthus of Sparta--a soul reborn. Apollo cannot bear to lose him again.\"\n\n \n\nClotho's spindle whirred. \"And the Chalice of Immortality--the elixir that could save Icarus--it lies hidden in the our keeping.\"\n\n \n\n\"But we have a plan,\" Atropos said with clenched teeth, her shears glinting.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus must die, spend three thousand years in the underworld, and then be reborn. Only then can he become the greatest hero.\"\n\n \n\nLachesis nodded. \"But his soul cannot be immortal and deathless on his second run. It must be tempered to become what we need.\"\n\n \n\nThe sisters exchanged glances. Apollo's defiance had consequences. Punishment was due.\n\n \n\n\"Throw Apollo into Tartarus,\" Atropos suggested. \"His domains are many, but he is not beyond our reach.\"\n\n \n\nLachesis hesitated as she twisted and turned the threads.\n\n \n\n\"Removing Apollo would doom humanity. His light guides mortals through darkness. With no sun there will be no warmth, light and crops. With no healing, death will not be swayed long enough for generations to replenish themselves. Without reason, logic and rationality, civilization can't hold. We need a different punishment. Make him watch Icarus die. Make Icarus chose death to save Apollo.\"\n\n \n\n\"But there's a complication,\" Clotho said. \"Apollo and Icarus have a son--little Alexios. Icarus would not choose easily between Apollo and their child.\"\n\n \n\nAtropos smirked. \"Then let Icarus decide. Give him a choice: death or Apollo's fall.\"\n\n \n\nLachesis nodded. \"When faced with losing his lover or sacrificing himself, Icarus would choose Apollo without hesitation.\"\n\n \n\n\"But Alexios,\" Clotho murmured, touching the boy's golden thread. It shimmered with specks of obsidian and sea green. Clotho eyed another thread, a longer one, obsidian with specks of gold.\n\n \n\n\"His fate is entwined.\"\n\n \n\nAtropos leaned in. \"Remove Alexios from the equation first. Sever his thread before Icarus has to make the choice.\"\n\n \n\nClotho hesitated, her spindle poised upon Alexios' beautiful thread and the other one. \"It's such a shame. He's destined for greatness.\"\n\n \n\nLachesis sighed.\n\n \n\n\"We can spin that thread again in three thousand years. It will give motivation to the third incarnation to make the right choices.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, the Fates conspired. They watched the possible future as Apollo pleaded with Icarus, as the mortal's heart wavered between love and sacrifice. They whispered to the winds, shaping the choices that would echo through eternity.\n\n \n\nApollo, unaware of their machinations, held Icarus close. The sun god's heart trembled, and the heavens themselves quivered. But fate was unyielding.\n\n \n\nIn the end, the Fates knew that Icarus would made the choice they wanted. He would fall, and Apollo would remain, screaming in agony, collapsing civilization in his rage and grief. The Chalice would wait, and Alexios's thread would be severed.\n\n \n\nThe loom hummed, and the Fates wove their verdict into the cosmic fabric. Destiny shifted, and the sun god wept. The entire world wept with him.\n\n \n\nFor love, defiance, and sacrifice--they were the threads that bound gods and mortals alike. And in the hidden chambers of the universe, the Fates laughed, their laughter echoing through time.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~In the ancient groves of Mount Olympus, where the gods roamed freely, Apollo sought out his sister Artemis in her sacred forest where only the goddess and her maiden companions were allowed to enter. The air crackled with tension as he stepped into her moonlit sanctuary. Artemis, the fierce huntress, stood there, her silver bow drawn, eyes ablaze.\n\n \n\n\"What brings you here, brother?\" she demanded, her voice sharp as an arrowhead.\n\n \n\nApollo hesitated, knowing the weight of his news. \"Artemis,\" he began, \"Hermes has uncovered a dark secret. Icarus has been cursed at birth to die young.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis's eyes widened with alarm and outrage. \"Cursed? By whom?\"\n\n \n\n\"A god,\" Apollo replied, his heart heavy. \"Icarus is fated to die young.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis's anger flared and she backhanded her brother across his divinely beautiful face.\n\n \n\n\"Your cursed luck in love,\" she spat. \"I knew that it would doom him.\"\n\n \n\n\"I know,\" Apollo whispered, letting the slap go unpunished but his eyes still flashed a lethal angry gold.\n\n \n\n\"But I have a plan. Divine blessings--countless--I have been woven into Icarus. He'll recover from any injury, his reflexes sharpened. And I'll watch over him, intervene if needed.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis clenched her fists.\n\n \n\n\"I have raised him since he was four. He's like a son to me. I hoped against hope that you would get to keep him forever. That I would get to keep him forever.\"\n\n \n\n\"When Icarus was four,\" Artemis said, \"was lured by enchanted flowers--the path that led him to monsters. It was Chloris, the goddess of blooms. She discovered he's the reincarnation of Prince Hyacinthus and tried to kill him out of jealousy.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis's eyes darkened as her fists clenched. \"I made her swear on the Styx never to harm Icarus again.\"\n\n \n\n\"But now,\" Apollo continued for Artemis, \"Chloris is a suspect. If she cursed Icarus, we can force her to rescind it. She is just some nymph turned goddess so that loathsome West Wind could marry her. A marriage that is no more. We have a lot of leeway to act. It would be quite different if it was an Olympian.\"\n\n \n\nThe divine twins exchanged a look. Their bows, silver and gold, gleamed in the moonlight. Together, they would hunt the goddess of flowers.\n\n \n\n\"Artemis,\" Apollo said, \"we'll save Icarus. We'll rewrite his fate.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, they set forth, their footsteps echoing through the sacred woods. Artemis's wrath fueled her arrows, while Apollo's determination blazed like the sun. They would unravel the curse, protect Icarus, and defy the threads spun by the Fates themselves.\n\n \n\nFor love, for family, they would confront Chloris--the goddess whose envy once threatened to snuff out Icarus's light.\n\n \n\nAnd as they ventured deeper into the forest, the moon whispered secrets, and the stars held their breath. The divine twins, bound by the exact same ichor and now a shared purpose, would weave their own destiny--one that defied even the Fates.\n\n \n\nIn the ancient days when gods and mortals walked the earth, there existed a goddess named Chloris. She was the embodiment of flowers--the delicate blooms that adorned meadows and gardens, their fragrant petals whispering secrets to the wind. But Chloris was no ordinary goddess. She had once been the wife of Zephyrus, the tempestuous west wind, until tragedy tore them apart.\n\n \n\nPrince Hyacinthus, a mortal youth of unparalleled beauty, had captured the hearts of both Zephyrus and Apollo. The sun god loved Hyacinthus fiercely, and was loved back by the prince just as fiercely. Their bond was forged in laughter and shared dreams. But fate is a cruel weaver, and one day, during a friendly game of discus, Zephyrus, consumed by jealousy, hurled the discus with deadly intent. It struck Hyacinthus, and the prince fell, his life extinguished like a fragile flame.\n\n \n\nYet those with ichor in their veins are not bound by mortal endings. Hyacinthus was reborn as Icarus, a boy just as beautiful as the dead prince, and once again captured the sun god's heart. His laughter echoed through the skies, but his fate remained unchanged--a curse woven into his very existence. Apollo discovered this truth, and his heart clenched with grief. He sought answers, and they led him to Chloris.\n\n \n\nChloris, once Zephyrus's lawful wife, had become a recluse. She wandered the meadows, tending to her flowers, her heart heavy with guilt. When she learned of Icarus's rebirth, rage and envy gripped her. She acted very rashly then. She remembered her past attempt to end his life when he was but a child of four. Artemis, the huntress and protector of youth, had thwarted her then, but the memory haunted Chloris.\n\n \n\nApollo confronted her among the blossoms. His golden hair blazed like the sun, and his eyes bore the weight of centuries.\n\n \n\n\"Chloris,\" he said, his voice as scorching as the midday sun during a droughty summer, \"did you curse Icarus?\"\n\n \n\nChloris trembled as she beheld the vengeful, wrathful Olympian.\n\n \n\n\"No,\" she whispered. \"I did not cast that curse upon him. If I had, I would not have tried to kill him when he was but a child.\"\n\n \n\nApollo, the god of truth, saw sincerity in her eyes. \"Then who?\" he demanded.\n\n \n\nChloris's gaze shifted toward the Underworld--the realm she once called home. How she wished she had never left. Zephyrus had promised her eternity and the world. He had given her eternity to suffer in and the forgotten and abandoned corners of the world to subside in.\n\n \n\n\"I know not,\" she replied. \"But Icarus's fate is not of my making.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's anger flared.\n\n \n\n\"Even if you did not curse him,\" he said, \"you still tried to end his life. For that, you shall pay.\"\n\n \n\nTogether with Artemis, the female divine archer, Apollo bound Chloris with golden fetters forged by Hephaestus himself. They dragged her to the edge of a mountain ledge, where the winds howled and eagles circled. Chloris's flower-crowned head bowed, petals wilting in despair.\n\n \n\n\"Release me,\" Chloris pleaded. \"I am innocent. I did not cast the curse!\"\n\n \n\nApollo's smile was cruel as it was beautiful. \"Innocence matters little,\" he said. \"You dared to harm my Icarus. And you could not keep Zephyrus in line and he craved my Hyacinthus!\"\n\n \n\nHe drew his bow, and seventy-seven fire arrows materialized. Each arrow bore the weight of Hyacinthus's memory, of love lost and betrayal. Apollo's aim was unerring. He shot Chloris, and her immortal form convulsed with pain. Then, with a swift kick, he sent her hurtling off the mountain.\n\n \n\nChloris plummeted, her scream echoing through the chasm. But immortality spared her from death. Instead, she would endure--bruised, broken, and scorched by Apollo's wrath. As she fell, she vowed to uncover the true curse that plagued Icarus, to seek redemption for her past sins. And maybe, the sun god would finally be appeased and leave her be.\n\n \n\nAnd so, Chloris descended into darkness, her flower petals trailing like tears. The gods watched, unmoved, for theirs was a world of divine justice, where even the innocent suffered. As the wind carried her away, Chloris knew that her recovery would be slow, but she would rise again, like the blossoms after winter's frost.\n\n \n\nAnd perhaps, someday, she would find the key to Icarus's fate--a truth hidden among the stars or buried deep within the earth. Until then, she clung to hope, for even in punishment, there lingered a spark of resilience--a bloom that refused to wither.\n\n \n\n~~~~~\n\n \n\nModern Era:\n\n \n\nPercy Jackson stood amidst the wreckage--the twisted metal of the Impala, the remnants of her life with her mother. Her heart clenched as she thought of her mom, but she could not allow herself to fall apart. Will was there, he needed her. She needed to be strong. Still, there was a small, petty part of her that was glad to see that accursed car in pieces. If only that beer guzzling piece of shit could see his precious car now.\n\n \n\nThe camp's edge was a liminal space, where the mundane world met the magical. She had returned to Camp Half-Blood, that she had once visited when she was Hyacinthus, the Crown Prince of Sparta, son of the Muse Clio and King Amyclas. Memories tugged at her like currents beneath the surface. Each moment brought more memories in her mind.\n\n \n\nHer belongings lay scattered--a battered blue dolphin plushie that Galaxaura had given to her when Percy was five years old. Percy had named it Seydon. She liked to hug it when she felt lonely, sad and overwhelmed by life.A few T-shirts and shorts, and a history book abou the Late Bronze Age Collapse. Which is Mr. D was to be believed was Percy's fault. Percy's mind swirled with fragments of her past lives, each thread woven into the tapestry of her existence.\n\n \n\nPrince Hyacinthus, Apollo's greatest love. The sun god had once held him, laughed with him, and mourned his death. Apollo had stayed with him for five years, when everyone told Hyacinthus he would be gone in weeks if not days. Percy remembered the warmth of Apollo's touch, the fragility of mortal life. But Hyacinthus had been reborn, far away from Sparta, in Crete as Icarus, the son of Daedauls the inventor and the naiad Naucrate. His laughter now echoed in the boy named Will Solace, who stood beside her.\n\n \n\nWill's eyes held questions--curiosity that danced between innocence and ancient knowing. \"Mom,\" he said, \"who was I before?\"\n\n \n\nShe hesitated. How could she explain?\n\n \n\n\"You were once Alexios. Icarides.\" she said softly. \"My son.\"\n\n \n\nAlexios--the child of Icarus and Apollo. A boy who had lived and died, his laughter silenced too soon. Percy's heart clenched. She had been a parent then, as Icarus, and the pain of loss still lingered, etched into her soul forever.\n\n \n\nWill's gaze held hers. \"Why don't I remember?\" he asked.\n\n \n\n\"Because,\" Percy said, \"the Fates wove their threads. They blackmailed me, forced me to fall from the sky. And when I was reborn for the third time, the tree--the one Apollo turned Icarus into--siphoned my demigod essence. It alerted Apollo to my existence.\"\n\n \n\n\"And he mixed his essence with yours,\" Will said, realization dawning. \"To find you.\"\n\n \n\n\"Yes,\" Percy confirmed. \"But instead of visions, he created you--a child of sun and sea.\"\n\n \n\nWill's brow furrowed. \"I want to know about Alexios,\" he said. \"My past life.\"\n\n \n\nPercy hesitated. \"He was adorable,\" she said with a smile as her eyes filled with tears that she refused to let fall. Strong, she needed to be strong. No falling appart. She would not be of use to anyone, let alone her own son if she let herself be weak.\n\n \n\n\"Cute as a baby, adorably mischievous as a toddler. But he--\"\n\n \n\nShe couldn't say it--the way Alexios had been taken from Icarus, the fragility of life. Even after three thousand years and a different existence, the wound remained raw.\n\n \n\nWill's eyes held a depth beyond his years. \"I understand,\" he said. \"But I want to know about before that.\"\n\n \n\nSo Percy told him--the laughter, the sun-kissed days, and the pain. She left out the final moments, the grief that had haunted her through lifetimes. Will listened, absorbing the echoes of a past he couldn't remember.\n\n \n\nAs they sorted her belongings into Poseidon's cabin, Percy wondered how to be a mother at twelve years old--to an eight-year-old boy who was her son reborn. She would protect him, guide him, and perhaps shield him from the memories that haunted her.\n\n \n\nFor in Will's laughter, she glimpsed both Apollo and Alexios--the sun and the fallen star. And maybe, just maybe, she could heal the wounds of ancient grief, one day at a time.\n\n \n\nPercy Jackson stood at the edge of Camp Half-Blood, her grief a tempest within. Her mother, Sally, had vanished during the Minotaur attack, leaving Percy with a void that echoed through her soul. The part of her that was Percy wanted to storm the Underworld, demand her mother's return. But memories of past lives weighed upon her. Her past selves had been older, wiser, they knew that actions had dire consequences.\n\n \n\nPrince Hyacinthus, Apollo's greatest love, had known the burden of loyalty. Raised to be the next king, he understood that choosing one person over many could doom an entire kingdom. His fatal flaw--a devotion that transcended reason--had cost him his life. Had cost Sparta its future king.\n\n \n\nAs Icarus, Percy had been friends with Nicodemos, a son and priest of Hades. When Icarus lost his three-year-old son, Alexios, he yearned to defy death. But Nicodemos cautioned him--the underworld held no salvation. Agents of Hades would hunt Alexios, and eternal punishment awaited him in the fields of suffering once captured. If Icarus was selfish he would doom his own son. Icarus had seen reason and listened to his friend despite the overwhelming, choking, raw grief.\n\n \n\nNow, as Percy stood in the woods, she gathered stones to construct an altar to Hades. Before the Shrine of Hades at Knossos had been constructed, Icarus had run across such structures in the woods quite a few times. Artemis had told him what they were. The goddess of the hunt was not pleased that forests, her domain were used to honor Hades but she allowed it. Hunters understood death.\n\n \n\nShe implored Hades to be kind to her mother, to allow Sally into Elysium. The boar hunting spear taken from the armory became her sacrificial blade. Blood stained her hands as she prayed for hours, her pleas to her godly uncle echoing through the trees.\n\n \n\nBut another boar attacked--a creature of rage and hunger. Percy fought, her grief fueling her fury. She killed the second boar, dragging its carcass back to camp. Covered in blood, she became a spectacle--the girl who killed the Minotaur with her bare hands and how was emerging from the woods, covered in blood and dragging a slaughtered beast toward the kitchens. Campers clad in those hideous orange t shirts stoped to stare, point and whisper. A tall, muscular girl with ragged brown hair looked angry when she saw the boar and glared hatefully at Percy. Of course, boars were Ares' sacred animal.\n\n \n\nChiron questioned her about hunting a boar, and Percy's teeth bared in a parody of a smile.\n\n \n\n\"I needed to kill something,\" she said to the centaur.\n\n \n\nDionysus arrived, eyeing the boar and her blood-soaked clothes. He sensed the truth--the blood of two animals, two sacrifices. There was no fooling a god who smelled blood upon the altars.\n\n \n\n\"Where is the other one?\" Dionysus asked.\n\n \n\nPercy's gaze met his.\n\n \n\n\"Not edible anymore,\" she replied, her voice raw.\n\n \n\nDionyus looked at the woods, and his lips disappeared in into a tight line.\n\n \n\n\"Get washed up and come to the big house. Someone wants to see you.\"\n\n \n\nIn the Poseidon cabin, she washed away the blood, her hands trembling. Little Will Solace followed her, concerned. Percy wondered how to be reasonable--to accept that some wounds could never heal, that defying death had consequences.\n\n \n\nAs she washed her clothing, thank you Poseidon for the water powers, she glimpsed Apollo's essence in Will's eyes--the sun and the fallen star. Perhaps reason lay not in defiance, but in acceptance. Percy vowed to protect Will, to guide him, and to honor her mother's memory. She could not get her mother back, but she could honor Sally by being a good mother to Will.\n\n \n\n\"Will, lets go. Mr. D said that someone in the Big House wants to meet me.\"\n\n \n\nThe old wooden door creaked open, revealing the cozy sitting room of the Big House at Camp Half-Blood. Percy Jackson stepped inside, her heart racing. She had been summoned here by Dionysus, who cryptically mentioned that someone wanted to meet her. Curiosity gnawed at her, and she hurried across the room, her hand tightly clasped in Will Solace's.\n\n \n\nAnd there, sitting on a plush armchair, was Ariadne. Princess Ariadne of Crete, Icarus' best friend, exactly as she was in the Icarus memories.\n\n \n\nPercy froze. Her mind raced, trying to make sense of what she was seeing. Ariadne--the same Ariadne who had been her best friend in a past life, when Percy was Icarus of Crete. The same Ariadne who had stood by Icarus and Theseus in the twisting corridors of the Labyrinth guiding them through what the malevolent entity threw at them. Ariadne who had laughed with Icarus, cried with Icarus, and shared secrets under the moonlight when they sought refuge from Minos' feasts.\n\n \n\nAriadne's eyes widened as she took in Percy's stunned expression.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" she whispered, her voice filled with wonder. \"You've returned.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's throat tightened. She remembered the last time she had seen Ariadne--the day they escaped the Labyrinth. Icarus had urged them to hurry, to flee from the pursuing Minos and his soldiers. To get in the ship and sail away. Daedalus had just finished constructing the wings--the magnificent wings that would carry them to freedom. And then, with a final glance at Ariadne as she sailed to safety, Icarus had taken flight, leaving her behind.\n\n \n\nMinos had roared in rage focusing on the winged men and not the ship, but Icarus and Daedalus had soared higher, disappearing into the sky. Percy had watched them go, torn between relief and heartache. She had lost her best friend, her confidante, and now, standing here in the Big House, she couldn't comprehend how Ariadne was here.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" Ariadne said, rising from her chair. Her eyes sparkled with tears. \"I never thought I'd see you again.\"\n\n \n\nPercy found her voice. \"Ariadne,\" she choked out. \"How? Why?\"\n\n \n\nAriadne stepped closer, her fingers brushing Percy's cheek. \"I remember,\" she said softly. \"I remember our laughter, our dreams. I remember the way you defended my honor. The memories of how much you valued me helped me, even when Theseus abandoned me on Naxos.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's anger flared. Theseus--the same brother she had now--had left Ariadne stranded on that island. And Icarus, loyal and fierce, had led Minos away, risking himself for her sake. She wished Theseus was here so she could throttle him by the neck.\n\n \n\n\"He hasn't changed,\" Ariadne continued, addressing her husband, her gaze intense. \"Icarus was always eager to protect me, even if it meant drugging my suitors with magical powders.\"\n\n \n\nFrom the corner, content to just observe the reunion of old friends with Will Solace, the most tolerable of the annoying little brats, Dionysus snorted, making his wife smile fondly.\n\n \n\nAriadne's heart swirled with emotions--gratitude, sorrow, and a fierce determination. She had lost Icarus once, but now, in this unexpected reunion, she vowed not to let him slip away again. They should have been gods together.\n\n \n\nAs Percy and Ariadne embraced, their past lives intertwined, Ariadne knew that this reunion was no accident. It was a gift--a chance to rewrite their story, to defy fate once more. And this time, she wouldn't let Icarus fly away without her.\n\nWork was insane this week, and I barely got time to write, especially since I am taking steps to deal with my insomnia.\n\nIcarus loses his son. The fates give him an ultimatum\n\nPercy meets the campers.\n\nTrigger: Child loss\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nKneeling before the ancient stone altar at the Shrine of Hades in Knossos, Icarus whispered prayers for his son, Alexios. The flickering torches cast eerie shadows on the cold walls, and the scent of incense hung heavy in the air. Beside him knelt Nicodemus, the head priest-- the son of Hades and a trusted friend.\n\nWhen the prayers had been spoken, Nicodemus turned to Icarus. His obsidian eyes, as dark as the abyss, held both compassion and curiosity. \"How fares your vengeance, my friend?\" he asked softly.\n\n \n\nIcarus clenched his fists. \"Apollo has not relented,\" he replied. \"The two main culprits--the elderly Cretan nobleman Eurytion and Alkinoos, Daedalus' maternal half-brother--are still suffering under his wrath. They were the ones who conspired to take my son's life.\"\n\n \n\nNicodemus nodded solemnly. \"Apollo's rage knows no bounds,\" he said. \"But fear not, for further justice awaits them once in the Underworld. Once they draw their last breath, Hades himself will ensure their torment in the Fields of Punishment.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus remembered how he had petitioned for this shrine when he was only eleven years old, how he had labored to honor Hades in the mortal realm by helping his son carry out his duties in dangerous quests. He had seen the god's wrath firsthand--the way he nursed grudges and exacted retribution. But Hades also recognized those who honored him sincerely, like Icarus.\n\n \n\n\"Alexios,\" Icarus whispered, his voice breaking. \"My precious son. Even as a three-year-old, he fought like a demigod against his murderers.\"\n\n \n\nNicodemus placed a comforting hand on Icarus' shoulder. \"He resides in Elysium,\" he assured.\n\n \n\n\"A fierce soul, worthy of paradise. But death is final, my friend. Trying to retrieve him from the Underworld would only damn you both eternally.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus wiped away tears. \"I know,\" he said. \"But it's not enough. I want him back.\"\n\n \n\nNicodemus sighed. \"Death is our shared fate,\" he said. \"We must find solace in memories and honor the gods who watch over us.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, in the dim light of the shrine, Icarus wept for his lost son, while Nicodemus stood by, a silent witness to grief and the unyielding passage of time. In the realm of gods and mortals, even love could not defy death's inexorable grasp.\n\n \n\n~~~\n\n \n\nThe sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the rocky cliffs of Mount Olympus. Apollo, the radiant god, felt it--the sudden severing of the bond that had linked him to his son, Alexios. The connection snapped like a taut bowstring, leaving an ache in Apollo's immortal heart.\n\n \n\nWithout hesitation, Apollo descended from the celestial heights. His golden chariot blazed across the sky, and he arrived at the scene of the crime--a secluded grove where the murderers cowered, their hands stained with innocent blood.\n\n \n\nThe killers were mere pawns, hired blades who had carried out their gruesome task. They fell to their knees, trembling, as Apollo's wrath enveloped them. Their confessions spilled forth like poisoned wine: it was the elderly nobleman Eurytion who had ordered the death of Alexios. Eurytion, driven by envy and malice, had unleashed these hired hands upon the child.\n\n \n\nApollo's anger knew no bounds. He raised his hands, and the air crackled with divine fire. The murderers screamed as their flesh blistered and charred. Their very souls writhed in agony, cursed for eternity.\n\n \n\nBut Apollo was not done. He sought out Eurytion, the puppet master behind the tragedy. The old nobleman stood defiant, unrepentant. \"Powerful demigods cannot be suffered to live,\" Eurytion declared, his voice dripping with venom.\n\n \n\nApollo's eyes blazed. \"And what of innocent children?\" he retorted. \"What of Alexios, whose laughter once echoed through the halls of our home?\"\n\n \n\nEurytion sneered. \"He was a threat--a flame that could consume us all.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's rage surged. \"You forget,\" he said, \"that I am the sun itself. I am the fire that burns eternal.\"\n\n \n\nHe turned to Icarus, the other grieving father. \"Your uncle Alkinoos,\" Apollo said, \"was the serpent who whispered poison into Eurytion's ear. He, too, shall face my wrath.\"\n\n \n\nTogether, they seized both murderers--the hired hands and the mastermind. Apollo's grip was unyielding. He dragged them to one of his hidden sanctuaries, where the his most cruel domains yawned like hungry maws.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus,\" Apollo said, his voice cold as the void, \"you may choose their fate.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus, tears streaming down his face, met Apollo's gaze. \"Let them suffer,\" he whispered. \"Slowly, as they took my son from me.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, Apollo descended into the depths. He would torture them, with fire and blade, and with the inexorable passage of time. Their screams would echo through the Underworld, a warning to all who dared harm the innocent.\n\n \n\nAs for Alexios, Apollo knew he resided in Elysium--a fierce little demigod who had fought valiantly against his murderers. But even gods could not undo death. Apollo wept silently, mourning the loss of his son, while the flames of vengeance consumed those who had dared to defy the bonds of love and kinship. Alkinoos was not just a kinslayer, he also was a violator of the sacred law of Xenia.\n\n \n\n~~~~\n\n \n\nIn the shadow of the Cretan cliffs, Icarus stood before the magnificent tomb he had built for his son, Alexios. The marble gleamed in the fading light, a testament to love and grief. Beside him, Daedalus--the master craftsman and Icarus's father--watched with sorrowful eyes. The inventor not only grieved his beloved and only grandson, but he also grappled with guilt. For it was his own brother who conspired to murder the child.\n\n \n\nPrincess Ariadne, Icarus's closest friend, approached. Her dark hair framed a face etched with pain. She had cared for Alexios during Icarus's hunts and quests, and her love for the boy ran deep.\n\n \n\n\"He was a bright star,\" Ariadne whispered, her voice catching. \"His laughter echoed through the palace gardens.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus nodded, tears blurring his vision. \"Apollo's son,\" he said. \"Our son.\"\n\n \n\nSince Alexios's death, the world had shifted. A drought parched the land, crops withered, and a plague swept through the villages. People grew illogical, their minds clouded by an acute lack of reason. Even the lyre players stumbled over their melodies, unable to evoke the usual magic.\n\n \n\nAriadne touched Icarus's arm. \"Apollo,\" she said, \" One of the most powerful gods is deeply grieving his beloved son.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus clenched his fists. \"Mortal grief harms only the one who bears it,\" he said. \"But a god's grief--\"\n\n \n\n\"--ripples through their domains,\" Ariadne finished. \"The sun weeps, and so does life.\"\n\n \n\nThey both knew the truth: Apollo's grief cast a long shadow. The sun god's power was rippling, leaving the world vulnerable. And in Crete, where King Minos ruled with an iron fist, fear and unrest spread like wildfire.\n\n \n\n\"The Minotaur,\" Ariadne said, her voice low. \"A monster born of unnatural union--a curse upon our island.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus nodded grimly. \"And King Minos,\" he added, \"a tyrant who feeds the beast with innocent lives.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne glanced toward the labyrinth--the twisted maze where the Minotaur roamed.\"We need a hero,\" she said. \"Someone to slay the monster, break the chains of fear.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's eyes blazed. \"The prophecy,\" he said. \"The son of Poseidon--the one destined to end this madness.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne shivered. \"But where is he? Crete trembles, and the gods remain silent.\"\n\n \n\n\"Perhaps,\" Icarus said, \"he waits in the shadows, gathering strength.\"\n\n \n\nAs they stood by Alexios's tomb, grief and determination mingled. They vowed to honor their lost loved one, to defy the darkness that threatened their world. And somewhere, beneath the waves, Poseidon's son stirred--a beacon of hope in troubled times.~~~~\n\n \n\nThe forests of Knossos stood silent, their ancient trees bearing witness to a fateful meeting. Icarus, lover of Apollo, trembled as the three Fates materialized before him--their eyes like shards of destiny.\n\n \n\n\"Atropos,\" Icarus whispered, \"Clotho, Lachesis. Why have you come?\"\n\n \n\nThe eldest Fate, Atropos, stepped forward, golden shears held menacedly in her withered hands. Her shears glinted in the fading light. \"Apollo,\" she said, her voice like the rustling of parchment, \"has defied us.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's heart clenched. \"Apollo? How?\"\n\n \n\n\"He hides a secret,\" Clotho intoned. \"A secret that binds your fate.\"\n\n \n\nLachesis's gaze bore into Icarus.\n\n \n\n\"You were cursed at birth,\" she said. \"To die young.You must die young. Our design demands it!\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's breath caught. The truth echoed through him--the fragile thread of his life , a blue green mottled with gold, woven by the Fates themselves.\n\n \n\n\"But Apollo,\" Atropos continued, \"loves you too much to let you die.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's mind spun. Apollo, the sun god, master of the domain of prophecy, defying fate for him? It was madness.\n\n \n\n\"He defies us,\" Clotho said, \"and we are angry.\"\n\n \n\n\"We want retribution,\" Lachesis added. \"Apollo must pay.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's plea rose. \"No,\" he said. \"Please, spare him.\"\n\n \n\nAtropos's cruel smile revealed her sharp teeth. \"We have a proposal,\" she said. \"A bargain.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's heart raced. \"What do you want?\"\n\n \n\n\"We'll spare Apollo,\" Clotho said, \"if you take the fall in his place.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's heart quivered not understanding what they wanted.\n\n \n\n\"Fly too close to the sun,\" Lachesis said. \"Let your feathers catch fire. Fall into the sea.\"\n\n \n\n\"And die,\" Atropos finished, \"as Apollo watches. We will make sure that he can't interfere. Can't save you from your fate, Icarus of the fearless flight.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's voice cracked. \"Cruel,\" he said. \"To make him witness my end.\"\n\n \n\nThe Fates laughed--a sound like unraveling fate. It hurt Icarus' ears, almost making them bleed.\n\n \n\n\"Do you want Apollo punished in Tartarus?\" Clotho asked.\n\n \n\n\"No,\" Icarus whispered. \"I'll accept your deal.\"\n\n \n\n\"Why?\" Atropos sneered.\n\n \n\n\"Because,\" Icarus said, \"not only I love him, but also the world can't survive without Apollo. The sun, healing, prophecy, reason--all rest upon him.\"\n\n \n\nThe Fates exchanged pleased glances.\n\n \n\n\"Very well little hero,\" Lachesis said. \"The deal is struck.\"\n\n \n\nThe Fates laughed, their laughter echoing across the ages. But Icarus knew--he had saved Apollo, and perhaps, in that sacrifice, saved the world. The most important thing was that Apollo would be spared. He would suffer but he would survive and eventually be all right. There was no other choice for Icarus to take.\n\n \n\nIn the opulent red halls of Knossos, where torchlight flickered against marble columns, Icarus stood, a shadow in mourning. His black chiton clung to his grief-stricken form, and silver jewelry adorned with black stones replaced the usual gold and brightly colored gems that marked his high status as Daedalus's only son and heir.\n\n \n\nPrincess Ariadne, his closest friend, moved beside him also clad in black but her jewelry gold, her eyes sympathetic. She, too, bore the weight of loss--their shared pain woven into the fabric of their friendship. Her brother, Deucalion, approached, offering condolences. Icarus accepted them tersely, his gaze distant.\n\n \n\nBut it was Minos, the cruel king of Crete, who disrupted the somber air. His voice, honeyed yet sharp, cut through the murmurs of the feast.\n\n \n\n\"Listen, noble guests,\" he announced, raising his goblet. \"News from Athens has reached our shores.\"\n\n \n\nAll eyes turned to Minos. The wine-dark sea whispered against the palace walls, eager for secrets.\n\n \n\n\"King Aegeus,\" Minos continued, hatred lacing his voice, \"has sired a son, by the name of Prince Theseus--a seventeen-year-old boy, not a babe in swaddling clothes. His mother is Princess Aethra of Troezen.\"\n\n \n\nHis lips twisted with bitterness. \"Aegeus kept this hidden, even when Prince Androgeus met his end in Athens. Denying me my proper due.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's suspicion flared. Why conceal a son? Aegeus, despite numerous marriages and dalliances, had remained childless. Yet now, this mysterious heir emerged from the shadows.\n\n \n\n\"Troezen,\" Icarus murmured to Ariadne, leaning close. \"A seaside kingdom, devoted to Poseidon. The god of the waves and storms. Aethra is a famed beauty. Beautiful enough for a god perhaps?\"\n\n \n\nAriadne's eyes widened. She understood the implications. A son of Poseidon--destined for greatness, perhaps even peril.\n\n \n\n\"This Prince Theseus,\" she whispered back, \"he bears the sea's mark.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus nodded. \"And a son of Poseidon is fated to slay the Minotaur.\"\n\n \n\nAs Minos raised his goblet in a toast, Icarus's mind raced. The labyrinth, the beast, the annual sacrifice--the threads of fate wove tighter. Prince Theseus, a secret son, stood at the crossroads of destiny. Would he unravel the Minotaur's monstrous secret, or would he, too, be swallowed by the maze's dark heart?\n\n \n\nIn the flickering torchlight, Icarus vowed to keep watch and plan. For the gods played their games, and mortal lives hung in the balance. And perhaps, just perhaps, the son of Poseidon held the key to their salvation. Ariadne meet his eyes and she nodded. They would make a plan to help Prince Theseus if their suspicions were correct. If Theseus was a son of Poseidon it would finally free Crete of the Minotaur.\n\n \n\nAnd so, as the feast continued, Icarus's grief mingled with anticipation. The black stones on his silver jewelry seemed to pulse, echoing the sea's ancient song--a requiem for lost innocence and a hymn to the unknown future.\n\n \n\nIcarus also had other plans, orders to follow from the Fates themselves. That he could not tell anyone. Not Ariadne, his best friend from infancy, not to his beloved father and certainly not to the love of his life, the sun god Apollo. But first he needed to obtain those wings. Icarus recalled an old design of Daedalus. For wings to fly on.\n\n \n\nIn the brightly lit recesses of Daedalus's workshop, Icarus sifted through the forgotten designs--the remnants of his father's genius. Among the dusty scrolls and half-forgotten blueprints lay a secret--a creation that could defy the very laws of nature: wings to allow men to fly.\n\n \n\nDaedalus had kept this design locked away, hidden from the world. Perhaps he feared the hubris of flight, the audacity of reaching for the heavens. Or perhaps he knew the danger it posed--the delicate balance between freedom and catastrophe.\n\n \n\nBut the Fates had spoken, their voices echoing through Icarus's dreams. Apollo, the sun god, had drawn their wrath. His love for Icarus had ignited their fury. They demanded retribution--a sacrifice to appease their cosmic scales. And so, they whispered their cruel decree: Icarus must fly close to the sun, let his wings catch fire, and fall into the sea. Only then would Apollo be spared.\n\n \n\nIcarus's heart weighed heavy as he unfurled the ancient parchment. The design was solid, intricate--a marvel of gears, feathers, and ambition. He traced the delicate lines, imagining the rush of wind against his skin, the taste of freedom. But freedom came at a cost--a price etched in flames and saltwater.\n\n \n\nHe found Daedalus in the corner, bent over a workbench, eyes hollow with grief. Alexios, their beloved grandson, had been murdered and taken from them five months earlier. The pain still seared their hearts, a wound that refused to heal.\n\n \n\n\"Father,\" Icarus said, his voice barely audible. \"I need your help.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus glanced up, eyes weary. \"What is it, my son?\"\n\n \n\nIcarus unfolded the design, revealing the wings--their delicate joints, the feathers like promises. \"Build these,\" he said. \"Two pairs.\"\n\n \n\nDaedalus's hands moved mechanically, assembling gears, shaping feathers. Each stroke was a silent plea--for forgiveness, for understanding. As the wings took form, Icarus watched, torn between love and duty.\n\n \n\nHe hated himself for this--forcing his father to build the very thing that would carry him to oblivion. Yet grief had twisted their souls, and desperate acts became their currency.\n\n \n\nWhen the wings were complete, Daedalus held them out--a fragile gift, a curse.\n\n \n\n\"Fly, my son,\" he said.\n\n \n\nIcarus fastened the wings to his shoulders, their feathers brushing his skin. He kissed Daedalus's forehead, tasting salt and sorrow.\n\n \n\n\"I love you,\" he whispered.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~\n\n \n\nModern Times:\n\n \n\nPercy Jackson stirred in her narrow bunk, the familiar strains of music weaving through her dreams. It was a melody she knew well, etched into her soul across lifetimes. Apollo's gift to his beloved, a gentle wake-up call that transcended time.\n\n \n\nAs her eyes fluttered open, Percy's gaze fell upon the wooden rafters of the Poseidon Cabin. The room smelled of saltwater and adventure, a comforting blend that reminded her of her dual heritage. She was no ordinary demigod; she was the reincarnation of two ancient legends--the ill-fated Prince Hyacinthus and Icarus.\n\n \n\nApollo had loved them both, and now, in this new life, he continued to serenade her awakening. Percy swung her legs over the edge of the bed, her bare feet touching the cool floor. The hideous orange Camp Half-Blood shirt lay crumpled nearby, a stark contrast to her own stylish navy blue shorts with the elaborate gold side buttons. She pulled it on with a wry smile, knowing it was a tradition she couldn't escape. At least not for now. She did hope Galaxaura did not see her in that T-shirt. The modelling agent would have a heart attack to see one of her girls wearing something so hideous.\n\n \n\nOutside, the dawn painted the sky in hues of pink and gold. Percy raced to the beach, her heart pounding. Apollo's music followed her, a gentle breeze carrying the notes. She reached the shoreline just as the sun peeked over the horizon, casting its golden net across the waves.\n\n \n\nAnd there, waiting for her, was her eight-year-old son, Will Solace. His hair glinted like sunlight, and had green eyes just like hers. Created from mixed essences--part Apollo, part mortal--he was a miracle born of love and fate.\n\n \n\n\"Morning, Mom,\" Will said, his voice as clear as the morning air. \"Did dad wake you up too?\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, her throat tight. \"He always does. It's our routine.\"\n\n \n\n\"All children of Apollo wake at dawn,\" Will explained matter-of-factly. \"It's in our blood.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's mind drifted back to her previous life as Icarus of Crete. Will's prior incarnation, Alexios, had been just as eager for the sunrise. He'd wake up hungry, craving cuddles from his \"Tata\" and a hearty breakfast. Percy chuckled, remembering how Alexios would devour anything in sight when hungry after a good night's sleep. He had been much pickier when it was time for lunch, only wanting his favorites and needing to be coaxed to eat the foods he didn't like.\n\n \n\n\"Are you hungry, Will?\" Percy asked, pulling him close. His warmth seeped into her skin, a connection that spanned centuries. She breathed his scent of sunshine with the hint of saltwater. It was still the same as before. The only thing that was different was the eyes. Their eyes had both changed color from their past lives.\n\n \n\nWill hesitated. \"I am, but... I don't want to eat something unhealthy.\"\n\n \n\nPercy reached into her pocket, producing a small bag of blue gummy bears.\n\n \n\n\"How about these? They're not exactly ambrosia, but they're a sweet treat.\"\n\n \n\nWill eyed the gummies, torn between temptation and caution.\n\n \n\n\"Okay, just one.\"\n\n \n\nPercy handed him a bear, and he popped it into his mouth. His eyes widened in surprise. \"It's good!\"\n\n \n\nTogether, they sat on the sand, munching on gummy bears, watching the sun rise. Percy felt the weight of her ancient memories--the love, the loss, and the promise of new beginnings. Apollo's melody still lingered, a thread connecting past and present.\n\n \n\nAs the first rays of sunlight touched the waves, Percy leaned down and kissed Will's forehead.\n\n \n\n\"We're a family, Will. Across time and space.\"He smiled, his dimples mirroring hers.\n\n \n\n\"Yeah, Mom. Forever.\"\n\n \n\nAnd so, with the taste of gummy bears on their tongues and the sun rising before them, Percy Jackson and her son embraced the day--a legacy of love, rebirth, and the eternal dance of gods and mortals.\n\n \n\nTheir moment was interrupted by the sound of a dry branch snapping. They turned around to see Will's half-brother, Michael Yew, the camp's best archer, standing there. His expression held a mix of relief and curiosity.\n\n \n\n\"At least you're not reacting like a typical father of an Athena camper,\" Michael said, eyeing their embrace.\n\n \n\nWill wilted a little, looking guilty. \"Yeah, I lucked out.\"\n\n \n\nPercy met Michael's gaze. \"Our circumstances are different. In my past lives, I actually agreed to have children with Apollo. As Hyacinthus I was the Crown Prince of Sparta, I needed an heir at least. And as Icarus I raised Alexios, Will's prior incarnation, for three years.\"\n\n \n\nMichael shifted uncomfortably.\n\n \n\n\"I guess I shouldn't judge the mortal fathers of Athena campers too harshly.\"Percy chuckled.\"Exactly. Imagine having a kid dropped on you with no warning after just an intellectual conversation.\"\n\n \n\nBut then Percy's expression turned serious.\n\n \n\n\"Speaking of unexpected children, let me tell you about Daedalus, my former father. Athena dropped baby Daedalus on his father, Prince Metion of Athens, just one day after discussing politics. Metion's tense marriage to noblewoman Alcippe became even more strained. She despised Daedalus, yet had to pretend he was her own to protect Athena's reputation. Daedalus endured a childhood of hardship, all because of divine whims.\"\n\n \n\nMichael listened, he did admit that it sounded quite rough.\n\n \n\nPercy smiled ruefully.\n\n \n\n\"That is quite the understatement. The goddess of wisdom went out of her way to give her son the backstory of a comic book villain. And then she had the gall to be all offended when Daedalus finally snapped and killed one of his nephews.\"\n\n \n\nMichael sighed. \"I'm glad I'm a son of Apollo. As much as it sucks to be a demigod, I know that it could be so much worse.\"\n\n \n\nTogether, they made their way to the training areas. Swords clashed, demigods honing their skills. Percy picked up a dull-edged practice blade, but it felt wrong in her grip. She needed something more.\n\n \n\nHer hairclip caught her attention--a simple accessory she'd worn for years. As she removed it, it transformed into Riptide--the sword given to her by her modeling agent, Galaxaura without Percy knowing. Riptide hummed with ancient power, and Percy knew it was meant for more than runway shows.\n\n \n\nChiron, the centaur trainer, approached.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, use one of the practice swords. Riptide is too dangerous for training.\"\n\n \n\nPercy turned Riptide back into a hairclip, tucking it away. She tested several blades until one felt right--a sword gifted to Camp Half-Blood by the Royal Forges of Atlantis. Charles Beckendorf, son of Hephaestus, raised an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n\"That's an interesting choice. Most don't like them because they are made by cyclops.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled. Memories flooded back--her friend Crocus from her life as Hyacinthus. Crocus, a son of Poseidon, had fought best with weapons forged under the sea. This sword felt like an echo of their bond. Crocus was no longer just a friend. He was now officially her brother. So were the other sons of Poseidon who had helped Crocus waterboard that son of Ares for Hyacinthus' sake.\n\n \n\nWith determination, Percy began her ancient Spartan routine. Her new body moved fluidly, muscles remembering battles long past. She needed to get used to this form, to fight effectively. She moved to practice on the dummies, demolishing a few with precision.Then Luke Castellan, a son of Hermes, called her over. Percy shrugged and approached. They began a duel. Luke was good, but he wasn't Spartan good. Percy disarmed him effortlessly, making him fall on his butt.\n\n \n\nHis eyes flashed with anger as was typical for a young man defeated by a girl, but he smiled. \"Again?\"\n\n \n\nPercy agreed. This time, Luke fought more aggressively. It made him sloppy, and once again, Percy disarmed him. Luke stared, astonished. \"You're incredible with a sword.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's response was simple: \"I was the Crown Prince of Sparta. That title isn't earned by being pretty.\"\n\n \n\nSeveral other campers eagerly demanded a turn fighting with her. Children of Ares and Athena challenged her, but Percy fought them one by one and emerged victorious. Her aggression surprised even herself--she was willing to harm the children of Athena more than the others. She could not help it, everytime she looked into those gray eyes, she recalled Alkinoos. Chiron, judgemental as always gave her looks of disappointment. The camp watched, whispers spreading like ripples on the water.\n\n \n\nThe sun-drenched paths of the camp led her back to her cabin, where the salty breeze whispered tales of Poseidon's lineage. But Percy did not get to go inside. As she approached, a tall, muscular girl stepped out from the shadows. Her ragged brown hair framed a face etched with defiance. This was Clarisse LaRue, daughter of Ares--the god of war.\n\n \n\nClarisse's presence was unmistakable. The scent of blood clung to her, a signature of Ares' children. Just as Percy bore the sea's fragrance, Clarisse carried the metallic tang of battlefields. Their worlds collided--the sea and the battlefield--two forces forever at odds. People liked to talk about Poseidon's rivalry with Athena, but children of Poseidon often came into conflict with children of Ares. The children of the sea were temperamental and the children of war aggrevating. Conflict was destined to happen.\n\n \n\n\"Why'd you kill those boars?\" Clarisse's voice crackled with anger. \"They're sacred to my father.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's sea-green eyes met Clarisse's fiery gaze. \"I was hunting,\" she replied calmly. \"The boars attacked me first.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse lunged, her fingers aiming for Percy's throat. But Percy, agile and battle-tested, sidestepped. Clarisse stumbled, crashing to the ground. Percy's instincts kicked in--she helped her adversary up, dusting off the dirt.\n\n \n\n\"You're quick,\" Clarisse grumbled, rubbing her bruised pride. \"But don't think this ends here.\"\n\n \n\nPercy continued toward the washrooms, her footsteps echoing defiance. Clarisse followed, fueled by rage. She wanted revenge, a chance to put Percy in her place. The washroom door swung open, and Percy stepped inside.\n\n \n\nClarisse's eyes narrowed. She'd heard tales of Percy's water manipulation abilities. Mr. D had complained very loudly about the tsunami that he had to hold back. The daughter of Poseidon could control the very element that flowed through the pipes. Clarisse had a different plan--a swirlie, a humiliating dunk in the toilet. The daughter of Poseidon would be defeated by her own element.\n\n \n\nBut Percy was ready. As Clarisse lunged again, water surged from the sinks and toilets. High-pressure jets shot toward Clarisse and her cronies. They stumbled, soaked, and sputtering. Clarisse's rage turned to shock as she was shoved out of the washroom, drenched and defeated.\n\n \n\n\"Next time,\" Percy said, her voice dripping like the water around them, \"think twice before challenging a child of Poseidon near water.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse seethed, her wet hair clinging to her face. \"This isn't over,\" she vowed, shaking her fist.\n\n \n\nPercy smirked. \"Want another toilet water bath?\"\n\n \n\nAngry and humiliated, Clarisse stormed away, leaving Percy standing amidst the dripping tiles. The reincarnation of Hyacinthus and Icarus had faced her own trials--boars, bullies, and the echoes of ancient love. But she stood strong, ready for whatever Camp Half-Blood threw her way.\n\n \n\nAnd as the water droplets settled, Percy wondered if Apollo was watching, amused by the twists of fate that brought them all together once more. She looked up at the sky, the sun winked at her. Percy smiled, glad that Apollo was letting her fight her own battles.\n\nI tried writing a death scene for Alexios but I just couldn't. Maybe I need to attend more writting workshops.\n\nThe Cretan duo meet Theseus and have an adventure in the Labyrith.\n\nPercy gets an archery lesson and meets mom #2\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nThe sun hung low on the horizon, casting a golden hue across the Cretan Sea. Icarus and Ariadne stood on the rocky cliffs, their eyes fixed on the distant ship approaching. It was time for the annual tribute from Athens to King Minos--a grim tradition that sent seven Athenian youths into the heart of the Labyrinth to face the dreaded Minotaur. It was always the same ship, painted black and bearing black as pitch sails. Of course, Athens mourned its sacrificed children. Icarus had always felt deep sympathy for the Athenian parents and families who lost their children to Minos' cruelty. Now, however he truly understood their pain, anguish and horror. The cheerful giggles of his beautiful son still echoed in his ears. Icarus had to blink back tears. If there was one blessing hidden in the Fates' cruel directive, it was that he would see Alexios soon.\n\n \n\nBut this year the Athenian tribute was different. King Aegeus had a son, Prince Theseus, and Minos, cruel and vengeful, demanded his inclusion among the victims. Minos had lost his son Androgeus in Athens, and blamed King Aegeus for it. Now Minos wanted to subject the Athenian King to the same pain. Aegeus had hesitated, torn between his love for his son and his duty as king toward his subjects. Yet, Prince Theseus, resolute and defiant, boarded the ship with the other doomed youths. A very noble act, but Daedalus had pointed out that it left Athens without a proper and clear heir to the throne.\n\n \n\nIcarus and Ariadne exchanged glances. They were no ordinary spectators. They suspected that Theseus was more than just a prince. A prophecy had whispered through the winds--a prophecy that spoke of a child of Poseidon who would slay the Minotaur. And Theseus fit the description perfectly. He was born to a beautiful princess of a city highly devoted to Poseidon, also, King Aegeus had no other children despite several marriages and many dalliances. They had received a description of the prince, unruly black hair, sea green eyes. Nearly all of Poseidon's known sons fit that description. Something about it niggled the recesses of Icarus' memory but he could not quite grasp it. Icarus would know if he had met a son of Poseidon before.\n\n \n\n\"He's the one. He has to be,\" Ariadne murmured, her eyes never leaving the ship's approach. \"The son of Poseidon.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus nodded, his heart racing.\n\n \n\n\"Our salvation arrives with him. Finally we can end the creature's reign of terror. The tyrant's reign of terror.\"\n\n \n\nThe waves around the ship seemed to writhe, moving unnaturally. Icarus pointed, renewed hope blooming in his chest, and Ariadne gasped with a delighted smile. Finally, they had confirmation. Theseus was the son of Poseidon.\n\n \n\n\"Look, the sea itself rejoices. We are right, he is the son of Poseidon.\"\n\n \n\nAs the ship docked, Theseus stepped onto the shore, his eyes scanning the cliffs. Icarus and Ariadne descended to meet him. The prince's gaze lingered on Ariadne, her clear sight revealing truths hidden from others.\n\n \n\n\"Who are you?\" Theseus asked.\n\n \n\n\"I am Ariadne, Princess of Crete\" she replied. \"And this is Icarus, the son of Daedalus, the inventor who once hailed from your city, Athens. We've been waiting for you.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus frowned. \"Waiting? Why?\"\n\n \n\nIcarus stepped forward.\n\n \n\n\"Because you're the one destined to end the Minotaur's reign. The son of Poseidon.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus blinked, absorbing their words. Given by his lack of surprise, he was already aware that the Minotaur was prophesied to be slain by a child of Poseidon.\n\n \n\n\"How do you know this?\"\n\n \n\nAriadne smiled.\n\n \n\n\"Prophecies have a way of finding those they concern. But listen, Theseus--the Labyrinth awaits you. Its magic veils the truth, deceiving all who enter. You'll need my help. I have the gift of clear sight. Magic is unable to cloud my eyes.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus clenched his fists. \"I won't let you face it alone. Ariadne's clear sight will guide us, but I'll be your shield.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus hesitated, then nodded at Icarus. \"I accept your aid. But what of you, Ariadne? You are a maiden. Can you stand to be part of this?\"\n\n \n\nShe touched his muscular arm.\n\n \n\n\"I may not be a warrior, but I know the Labyrinth's secrets. Together, we'll unravel its twists and turns.\"\n\n \n\nAs they approached the entrance, the mist thickened, obscuring their vision. Icarus felt its tendrils brush against his mind, but Ariadne's hand steadied him.\n\n \n\n\"Remember,\" she whispered, \"the Minotaur lies at the heart. We must find reach it so you can slay the beast.\"\n\n \n\nThe air in the grand hall of King Minos's palace hung heavy with anticipation. The Harvest Feast was a cruel tradition--a grotesque display of the doomed Athenian youths who would soon venture into the Labyrinth to face the Minotaur. Among them stood Prince Theseus, resolute and unyielding. The feasting guests eyed the Athenian Prince with curiosity. Theseus stood tall, holding his head high like the royalty that he was. His quiet courage and dignity contrasted with the indolent repose of Minos' surviving sons.\n\n \n\nThe other Athenians, pale and terrified, watched as the Cretan nobility feasted to celebrate their misfortune. Minos, cruel and vengeful, reveled in their suffering. His eyes gleamed as he surveyed the captives, parading them like lambs to the slaughter.\n\n \n\nAnd then, Prince Theseus arrived at the dais where the Athenians usually stood on, to be gawked at by the Cretans. With a twisted smile Minos declared that they had a royal among the captives. The tyrant invited Theseus to sit at the table, he was free to chose whichever spot he wanted. Theseus chose a spot not far from Minos himself, flanked by two figures--the most beautiful young people in Crete. Icarus, with glossy black curls and amber eyes that held secrets, and Ariadne, the beautiful and gracious princess. They were inseparable, bound by friendship going back to their cradles.\n\n \n\nMinos, wine goblet in hand, leaned toward Theseus. \"Ah, Prince of Athens. You have good taste, sitting beside Icarus and my Ariadne.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus inclined his head. \"Their company is an honor.\"\n\n \n\nMinos smirked. \"Icarus, my dear boy, Apollo has been with you for five years now. A loyal lover, isn't he?\"\n\n \n\nIcarus raised his wine goblet, a silent acknowledgment. Minos really loved to brag at how devoted the sun god was toward one of his Cretan subjects. Theseus, gracious, offered his congratulations. But beneath the pleasantries, tension simmered. Icarus gestured to one of the mainservants serving the food. The woman immediately placed a platter in front of Theseus. Icarus then retrieved meat, flatbreads, cheese, olives and fruit from the nearby communal plates to feed the prince. Theseus would need all his strength. So would Icarus, so he forced himself to eat.\n\n \n\nThe court's bard played a mournful tune with many errors, and Minos scowled.\n\n \n\n\"Inept,\" he muttered. \"All musicians lately.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus went still, musicians failed because just like him, Apollo was grieving their beloved son. The drought and the plague had not ebbed yet, even though its effects had yet to reach Knossos. But it was still poor taste for Minos to feast while his subjects starved and fell ill.\n\n \n\nPrince Deucalion leaned over. \"Except Icarus. He still plays his lyre beautifully.\"\n\n \n\nApollo had ensured that Icarus would have music to comfort himself when the terrible pangs of grief struck him.\n\n \n\nMinos's eyes narrowed. \"Icarus, play for us.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus rolled his eyes at the king's command but borrowed the lyre from the disgruntled bard. His fingers danced across the strings, weaving a melody Apollo himself had taught him--a haunting, otherworldly tune that held both sorrow and hope. The bard, freed from his curse, resumed playing. He shot Icarus a grateful glance, thinking that the touch of the lover of the god of music had resolved the curse.\n\n \n\nBut Minos wasn't satisfied. \"Dance, Icarus. Show us your skill.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus hesitated, then stepped away from the table. His dance--the Geranos--was a tribute to the Labyrinth itself. He spun, twisted, and leaped, mimicking the labyrinthine paths. His movements defied gravity, as if he navigated unseen corridors.\n\n \n\nAriadne watched, her eyes alight. She knew the Labyrinth's secrets--the twists, the turns, the hidden passages. Icarus's dance mirrored its complexity.\n\n \n\nMinos clapped, delighted. \"A true marvel! Apollo's gift, no doubt.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus leaned closer to Ariadne. \"What is this dance?\"\n\n \n\n\"The Geranos,\" she whispered. \"A dance of twists and turns. Icarus knows it well.\"\n\n \n\nMinos leaned back, satisfied. \"Theseus, you've chosen fine companions. Apollo's lover and my most beautiful and obedient daughter.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus met Icarus's gaze. \"I am honored to be in their presence, King Minos.\"\n\n \n\nAs the feast continued, Icarus and Ariadne exchanged glances. They'd risked everything to aid Theseus. The two friends nodded at each, a silent promise. Together, they'd pierce the Labyrinth's veil, unravel its enchantments, and face the beast.\n\n \n\nThe moon hung low, casting eerie shadows across the Labyrinth's entrance. Theseus and the other Athenian youths shuffled forward, their faces etched with fear. The cruel soldiers, Minos's enforcers, herded them like sheep. Theseus scowled, his jaw clenched as his subjects were harshly led in before him. The guards laughed, delighting in watching the dutiful prince be unable to defend his fellow Athenians.\n\n \n\nBut amidst the chaos, two figures moved silently--unseen, unnoticed. Icarus, Apollo's lover, and Princess Ariadne, his best friend. They had a purpose--to help Theseus fulfill the prophecy, to put an end to the Minotaur's hunger.\n\n \n\nIcarus crept close to Theseus, eyes locked on the prince. Theseus's gaze flickered to him, recognition dawning. Without a word, Icarus tossed a sword--the celestial bronze blade glinting in the moonlight. Theseus caught it, his resolve hardening. He immediately stabbed the closest guard and moved to kill another.\n\n \n\nAs the soldiers turned their backs to face the prince, Icarus drew his bow. Arrows whispered through the air, finding their marks. Together, sword and bow, they silenced the guards. Blood pooled around them, staining the stones.\n\n \n\nAnd then, Ariadne emerged from her hiding place. She stepped over the corpses, her eyes meeting Theseus's. Infatuation bloomed in his gaze, mirrored by her own dawning love. Icarus watched, a bittersweet smile tugging at his lips. He would never get to attend Ariadne's wedding.\n\n \n\nHe knew his fate--doomed to die soon, the Fates themselves had demanded that he fall. But he'd ensure Theseus's survival and triumph. His best friend would be safe, cared for. That was enough.\n\n \n\nTogether, the three pushed open the Labyrinth's door. Ariadne walked in the middle, flanked by the two men. Theseus's sword gleamed, and Icarus's bow hummed with tension. The Labyrinth, magical and treacherous, sought to deceive them--to lead them astray.\n\n \n\nBut Ariadne's clear sight pierced illusions. She guided them, her steps unwavering. Monsters lunged--horrors born of twisted magic--but Theseus fought, Icarus shot, and Ariadne led. They moved deeper, toward the heart of the maze.\n\n \n\nAnd there, in the shadowed chamber, the Minotaur awaited--a monstrous hybrid, half man, half beast. Its eyes glowed with hunger, its breath hot and fetid. Theseus raised his sword, Icarus nocked an arrow, and Ariadne whispered ancient truths.\n\n \n\nThey attacked--the prince's blade, the archer's aim, and the guide's wisdom. The Minotaur roared, its rage echoing through the winding passages. But they were a trio--a bond forged in sacrifice, friendship and love.\n\n \n\nAs the final blow struck, Icarus's vision blurred from tears of relief, from the secrets he had to keep from the people he loved the most. He glimpsed Theseus's victorious face, Ariadne's unwavering resolve. And so, the Labyrinth trembled, its malevolence fading. Theseus, Icarus and Ariadne, stood by the slain Minotaur.\n\n \n\nThe sun hung low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the marble walls of the Labyrinth. Theseus, his sword stained with Minotaur blood, emerged from the twisting maze, Princess Ariadne and Icarus at his side. The prophecy fulfilled, the Athenian prince had slain the monstrous beast that had haunted Crete for many years.\n\n \n\nTheir absence did not go unnoticed. People noticed when a princess disappeared. They noticed even more when Apollo's lover was nowhere to be seen. The guards lay lifeless by the entrance, their eyes wide with shock, pools of dried blood around it. King Minos, ruler of Crete, paced impatiently in his palace, his anger simmering like the midday sun.\n\n \n\nIcarus, the son of the inventor and lover of Apollo, knew they had to act swiftly. He urged Theseus and Ariadne toward the waiting ship, the sails billowing in anticipation. But he and his father had a different escape plan--one that defied earthly bounds. Several months before, Icarus had urged Daedalus to create the wings that would carry them away from Crete. That Icarus knew would carry him to his death as dictated by the Fates.\n\n \n\n\"Go!\" Icarus shouted, his voice echoing off as they run through the streets, half carrying Ariadne between them. The few surviving Athenians following at a run.\n\n \n\n\"To the ships! You need to board and set sail as soon as you can!\"\n\n \n\nTheseus hesitated, his eyes searching for his friend. \"Icarus, what--\"\n\n \n\n\"No time!\" Icarus interrupted.\n\n \n\n\"Trust me. My father and I have a way out. I have planned it for months.\"\n\n \n\nAriadne clung to Theseus's arm, her eyes wide with worry for Icarus. The surviving Athenians murmuring beside them.\n\n \n\n\"Be safe,\" she whispered to her best friend.\n\n \n\nIcarus sprinted through the streets of Knossos, his heart pounding. He reached his father's mansion, the workshop hidden within. Daedalus, the brilliant craftsman, awaited him.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus!\" Daedalus called, emerging from the shadows. \"Quickly!\"\n\n \n\nThe mechanical wings lay on a workbench, delicate feathers interwoven with metallic gears, sinew and wax. Daedalus secured them to Icarus's back, adjusting the straps.\n\n \n\n\"Remember, my son,\" he said, his eyes filled with both pride and fear, \"fly neither too low nor too high. The sun's heat will melt the wax, and the sea's dampness will weigh you down.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus nodded, his pulse racing. He glanced out the window, spotting Minos's soldiers converging on the harbor. Theseus and Ariadne were almost aboard the ship.\n\n \n\n\"Go,\" Daedalus urged. \"Draw Minos's attention away. Give them time.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus leaped from the window, wings unfurling. The wind caught him, lifting him higher. He soared over the city, the sun's warmth caressing his face. Icarus felt Apollo's emotions in the sunlight, his lover was very puzzled, and very curious. But somewhat amused by the wings and Icarus' stunts with them. Below, Minos's shouts echoed, but Icarus paid them no heed.\n\n \n\nHe looped and spiraled, performing daring maneuvers. Minos's guards pointed upward, their spears raised. Icarus laughed, taunting them. His wings carried him toward the sun, and for a moment, he felt invincible. Icarus shook his head, he could not get caught in the glory of flight, the utter freedom. He had a mission. Daedalus took to the skies himself. Icarus followed is father at a sedate pace, Apollo's sunlight never leaving his skin.\n\n \n\nTheseus' ship was moving unnaturally fast drawn by both a strong current and a strong and unnatural wind. The prince was either using his powers or his godly father was aiding him directly. Daedalus and Icarus followed on the wing. The wind was too strong for them to descend on the ship and Icarus knew that it was the Fates design.They were dragged by the wind past several islands. From his lessons Icarus recognized Calliste and Thirasia. Then Sikinos, Manganaris.\n\n \n\nThe Fates whispered in his ears, \"Naxos will be next. Be ready Icarus. The future Icarian sea and the future island named Icaria awaits.\"\n\n \n\nHe looked up at the sky. Apollo was in his chariot, his sunlight felt worried upon Icarus' skin. With a heavy heart, Icarus suppressed the tears he longed to shed. This was all for Apollo's sake.\n\n \n\n~~~~~Modern Era:\n\n \n\nPercy Jackson stood at the edge of the archery range in Camp Half-Blood, her heart pounding. Today marked her first archery lesson, and the instructor was none other than Apollo himself. The sun god had managed to wriggle free from Zeus's demands on Olympus, and now he stood before a class composed mostly of his own children. Apollo, had chosen a younger form, one that matched Percy's age, maybe a year older. Will Solace, their son, hovered nearby, watching with interest. Percy wondered what her son was thinking, given that his parents looked only a few scant years older than him.\n\n \n\nApollo handed Percy a sleek bow and a quiver of arrows. His expression betrayed worry, and Percy couldn't blame him. In this life, she'd never touched a bow, but her past lives definitely had. As Prince Hyacinthus, she'd been a decent archer, hunting regularly and bringing back game for the palace kitchens. Hyacinthus usually preferred prey that fell to spears but he brought arrow shot game often enough. As Icarus, Artemis herself had taught her to wield a bow from the tender age of four. She had been the best mortal archer and hunter in Crete.\n\n \n\n\"Give it a shot,\" Apollo said, his golden eyes assessing her.\n\n \n\nPercy assumed perfect form, her muscles remembering the weight of the bow. She loosed the arrow, expecting it to hit the target dead center. But to her astonishment, it flew wide, sailing behind her. Apollo caught it effortlessly.\n\n \n\nAgain, she tried, and again, the arrow missed its mark. Apollo's apologetic smile didn't ease her annoyance.\n\n \n\n\"What's going on?\" she demanded.\n\n \n\nApollo leaned on his own bow, his gaze distant.\n\n \n\n\"After the Trojan War,\" he began, \"Zeus forced me to do things I didn't want. He was annoyed at the whole civilization collapse thing.\"\n\n \n\n\"First, I defended Orestes, the filthy matricide, in court against the Furies.\"\n\n \n\nApollo spat in disgust, looking as if he desperately needed a thorough bath to feel clean. Percy could not blame him, all ther lives she had been as devoted to her mothers and mother figures as Apollo was to Leto. To be forced to defend a matricide of all things. Zeus really could not have chosen a better punishment for the original mama's boy.\n\n \n\nPercy's mind raced as the parts of her that had been raised in the vipers nest known as royal courts caught the implications.\n\n \n\n\"To weaken the Furies' power, and thus Hades',\" she guessed.\n\n \n\n\"If the court held supreme authority over wrongdoers, they couldn't pursue kinslayers. They would lose prestige and power. No wonder Mrs. Dodds was so easy to defeat.\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded at her with a bright smile, his eyes glowing with pride.\n\n \n\n\"Exactly. But sometimes I wish Zeus had thought of this when you were Hyacinthus. Your half-brothers Argalus, Cynortas, and Harpalus would've been easier to handle if they feared you'd kill them.\"\n\n \n\nPercy clarified for the somewhat horrified listening audience: she wouldn't have harmed her relatives unless in immediate self-defense or defense of another. But she pressed Apollo.\n\n \n\n\"What else did Zeus make you do?\"\n\n \n\nHis expression darkened.\n\n \n\n\"He ordered me to curse Poseidon's demigods. They'd be unable to use the bow. I rescinded the curse right after Poseidon claimed you, but it'll take time to fully dissipate.\"\n\n \n\nPercy sighed. She was glad that she had retained her old skills with a sword and a spear but naturally there was going to be a catch somewhere. Still, it stung something fierce that she had lost skills that Artemis herself had personally and painstakingly instilled in her. At least she could still hunt with spears and javelins.\n\n \n\n\"Guess I'll learn the hard way.\" She told Apollo, mustering a smile for him.\n\n \n\nShe aimed the bow again, practicing under Apollo's watchful eye. Arrows flew astray and he caught them before they could hit anyone, but she improved steadily, managing to hit the target's edge. She hoped she wouldn't encounter the Hunters until she could hit a bull's-eye--especially Phoebe, who'd never let her live this down.\n\n \n\nAs if summoned by her thoughts, a glowing silver deer emerged from the forest. Percy's breath caught. She recognized Artemis's sacred animal. The goddess herself awaited, and Percy run to meet her.\n\n \n\nPercy Jackson's heart raced as she followed the glowing silver deer deeper into the forest at Camp Half-Blood. The sacred animal was unmistakably Artemis's sign, and Percy's memories stirred. She was no ordinary demigod; she carried the echoes of two past lives--the tragic Prince Hyacinthus and the daring Icarus, both entangled in Apollo's love.\n\n \n\nApollo trailed behind her, concern etching his features. When Percy had been Icarus, Artemis had saved her life at the tender age of four. The goddess had taken her as a student, teaching her archery and hunting. Artemis had been a surrogate mother to the motherless Icarus, and he'd been devoted to her beyond measure.\n\n \n\nNow, Percy stood in bright clearing, her breath catching. Artemis awaited her, but to Percy's surprise, the goddess had assumed the form of a twelve-year-old girl. Close by stood Polyboea, Hyacinthus's sister, and Phoebe, the Cretan girl whom Icarus had rescued and delivered to Artemis. But further back, scowling fiercely, was a tall, dark-skinned young woman wearing a silver circlet--a Persian princess, perhaps. Percy did not recall her from her time as Icarus, but it had been more than three thousand years. Of course more girls had joined Artemis' ranks since.\n\n \n\nPercy chose to ignore the scowling girl and focused on Artemis. She dropped to one knee, her heart pounding. Artemis helped her up, cupping Percy's face. A rare smile graced the goddess's lips.\n\n \n\n\"Congratulations on rising back from the dead once more,\" Artemis said.\n\n \n\n\"And this time, your only defect--being male--is fixed.\"\n\n \n\nPercy couldn't help but laugh, Artemis would never change. Here, in the presence of the huntress, she felt a bit more whole. Apollo watched, looking very proud, as his reincarnated love stood before the goddess who had shaped her destiny in her second lifetime.\n\n \n\nPolyboea approached, drawing her into a quick hug. Percy closed her eyes, stinging with tears. This was her little sister, now much, much older than her.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, do you recall your life as Hyacinthus?\" Polyboea asked, meeting Percy's eyes.\n\n \n\nPercy smiled and decided to tease her a bit.\n\n \n\n\"Ah, my dear baby sister. I remember it well. You followed me around like a little duckling, those puppy dog eyes begging for extra honey cakes.\"\n\n \n\nPolyboea, never one to take bait to teasing retorted.\n\n \n\n\"And you taught me archery, hoping I'd join Artemis's Hunters and escape a horrible political marriage.\"For some reason Polyboea aimed that at the scowling girl with the silver circlet. Percy frowned, but her attention was drawn by Phoebe who briefly patted her shoulder.\n\n \n\n\"We saw your archery practice, Percy.\" The redhaired girl told her with a sing song voice.\n\n \n\n\"Blame the archery curse on Poseidon's demigods. I'll regain my old skills.\"\n\n \n\nPercy gave a look at Apollo, who smiled at her and looked pointedly at the sky.\n\n \n\nThe girl with the silver circlet scowled more.\n\n \n\nPercy, now curious asked.\n\n \n\n\"Who's she?\"Artemis replied, \"Zoe Nightshade, Lieutenant of the Hunters. She joined me shortly after your death as Icarus.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis looked upset, as if relieving something deeply painful. Percy chose not to press further. The girl, Zoe, moved closer.\n\n \n\n\"True, Percy is a girl this time.\"\n\n \n\nApollo glanced at Zoe with mild dislike.\n\n \n\n\"The Fates likely did it to make my job harder, I checked every single boy to find the third incarnation but none of the girls.\"\n\n \n\nPercy snorted, amused despite herself.\n\n \n\n\"Got to give to the demon triplet grandmothers. They really know how to get under someone's skin. Respect to the trolls.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's lips tightened.\n\n \n\n\"I don't find it even remotely funny! First they force you to fall and now they prevent me from finding you until that satyr got desperate enough to pray!\"\n\n \n\nArtemis turned to her brother, her expression flinty and furious.\n\n \n\n\"What do you mean they forced Icarus to fall? I thought it was the curse acting up!\"\n\n \n\nAll Percy could think was oh, oh.\n\nHave a day of but the weather unfortunately sucks so just staying home and writing.\n\nBTW, my pronouns are she/her. Saw a comment addressing me as them/they.\n\nIcarus only for this chapter. This will be the end of the Icarus arc. No Percy for this chapter. I wanted to focus on finishing Icarus' story.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nIn the golden light of dawn, Apollo watched from his sun chariot as Icarus donned the mechanical wings crafted by Daedalus. Curiosity gnawed at the god's heart--why would his beloved choose such a perilous method to escape King Minos's wrath? Surely, Icarus could have asked Apollo to intervene, to quell the king's rage with a mere word. Many times Apollo had asked his beloved that question, both as Hyacinthus and Icarus. The answer from both incarnations of his beloved was that Apollo was their lover, they had no wish to exploit his kindness. Helping each others as partners was one thing, but constantly asking for divine favours from Apollo was another. Apollo did not quite get it, but he was glad that his beloved loved him fiercely and sincerely.\n\nBut no. Icarus, ever headstrong, had other plans. It seemed like Icarus, after a lifetime of having to hold his tongue with the tyrant Minos wished to heap as much humiliation upon the King of Crete as possible before escaping Crete. With a mischievous grin, he tested the wings, flapping them like a fledgling bird. Daedalus, the brilliant inventor and Icarus's father, followed close behind, his eyes wide with both pride and trepidation. Minos was definitely headed to disgrace. He had lost his monster, and he had lost having monopoly ove the mind of Daedalus. Minos might be beseeching the gods now, but Apollo knew that Zeus would turn away after Minos had been fooled and hoodwinked by a son of Poseidon. The gods would follow a different tale, the young and bold hero was more compelling than the old and humiliated king.\n\n \n\nApollo leaned forward, amused as Icarus did daring maneuvers to the astonishment of everyone watching. Apollo had to admit, the wing were a marvel of artificing. Daedalus had outdone himself.\n\n \n\n\"Why these wings, Icarus?\" he whispered to the wind, feeling a shift in the cosmic tapestry. These wings would be important. They will not just carry Icarus away from Crete. These wings were destined to echo across centuries and inspire. Were mortals destined to brave the skies? Would his beloved start this?\n\n \n\n\"Why not seek my aid?\"\n\n \n\nIcarus soared, taunting Minos and his soldiers drawing them away from the Athenian ship and Princess Ariadne. Apollo marveled at the boy's audacity. The sun god had seen many mortals defy kings and tyrants, but none quite like Icarus. His beloved was taunting Minos, a sky spawn from the sky itself while the tyrant was earthbound and could not follow in the air. How it must rankle Minos.\n\n \n\nThe thrill of freedom danced in Icarus's eyes as he ascended, carried away from Crete on winds conjured by a deity. Apollo frowned. At first he thought it was his uncle Poseidon, aiding his son Theseus and his grandson Icarus, but it did not feel like his uncle. It did not feel like one of the four winds either. Apollo would notice if it was one of them, especially the West Wind.\n\n \n\nBelow, Theseus's ship sailed toward Naxos. Apollo's heart swelled with pride. Icarus and Princess Ariadne, Theseus's saviors, they, the hunter and the princess had helped the Athenian prince brave the Labyrinth and slay the Minotaur. Apollo's lover was part of that heroic tale, even if it meant risking his own life.\n\n \n\nYet, as Icarus flew past Naxos, something changed. His gaze, usually filled with mischief, turned strange. Apollo squinted, concern knotting his brow. Why did Icarus look up at him with such sorrow? Was his beloved thinking of their precious son. Their dear Alexios, taken from them far too son? Of course it was that. What else could it be.\n\n \n\nAn unnamed island loomed ahead--a place yet to be named, where destiny would carve its mark. Icarus flew past it, tears streaming down his face. Apollo's worry deepened. A dark foreboding striking his heart as he realised just who had conjured the winds carrying Icarus, Daedalus and the ship. It was the Moirai. It was the Moirai who were aiding Icarus' escape. The dreaded triplets never did anything without first asking something in return. They would not deem Theseus or Ariadne important enough to bargain with. Theseus' prophecy was finished, done. Ariadne's fate was bound to Theseus' decisions. That left Icarus. Daedalus had not been involved in the quest to kill the Minotaur. What had the Moirai whispered to Icarus? What cruel bargain had they struck? For it could not be anything other than cruel, if it was the Moirai offering.\n\n \n\nAnd then it became clear. The Fates materialized near Apollo, their presence chilling. Golden threads encircled him, binding him to the sun chariot.\n\n \n\n\"Watch, Apollo,\" they hissed.\n\n \n\n\"Watch as Icarus ascends. In a different way you intended by defying our will.\"\n\n \n\n\"Why?\" Apollo demanded.\n\n \n\n\"What game do you play?\"\n\n \n\nThe Moirai laughed, their voices like the rustling of ancient scrolls. \"Icarus chose,\" they said. \"His death or your fall into Tartarus.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's heart shattered. His domain of prophecy activated and he glimpsed Icarus's choice--the boy's love for him so fierce that he'd defy fate itself. The sun god strained against the threads, but they held him fast.\n\n \n\n\"No!\" he screamed. \"Release me! I must save him!\"\n\n \n\nIcarus flew higher, flames licking at his wings. Apollo's vision blurred as tears welled.\n\n \n\nThe Fates cruelty was undaunted as they taunted Apollo, forcing him to watch as Icarus flew higher and higher, tears streaming down his face. The Fates knew Apollo intended to defy them and make Icarus immortal, even though he was destined to die young. They reproached Apollo for loving Icarus so much that he would challenge fate.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus! My love! No!\" he cried. \"I'll save you!\"\n\n \n\nBut the Fates were unyielding. \"He chose,\" they repeated. \"And so must you.\"\n\n \n\nIcarus's wings caught fire, and he plummeted toward the sea. Apollo's screams echoed across the heavens, and the sun dimmed. His lover fell, and the world wept. Apollo felt it when Icarus' thread was cut by cruel Atropos. The moment he hit the water. Just as it was with Hyacinthus, Apollo's immortal heart shattered. Grief flooded him, his mind went blank, unable to comprehend anything other than that his beloved was gone.\n\n \n\nIn that moment, Apollo understood love's cost--the agony of defying fate, the price of devotion. As Icarus vanished into the waves, the sun went black, mourning the loss of a love that had dared to soar too high.\n\n \n\nDaedalus noticed his son flying too high and started screaming at Icarus to get down.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus, come down! You're flying too close to the sun!\" he shouted, his voice filled with panic.\n\n \n\nDesperation filled his heart as he tried to fly up to him, but the winds kept him from reaching his son.\n\n \n\n\"Please, gods, help me!\" Daedalus screamed and pleaded with any god who would listen.\n\n \n\nIn his frantic search for help, Daedalus noticed Apollo chained and realized something was terribly wrong.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo, why are you chained?\" he cried out, but there was no response. His heart sank as he saw Icarus' wings catch fire.\n\n \n\n\"No, Icarus!\" he screamed as his son began to fall, too fast for anyone to do anything, not even the god who loved Icarus fiercely and devotedly. Daedalus screamed and cried as the winds threw him onto Theseus' ship.\n\n \n\nOnboard, Ariadne was also screaming, tearing at her hair and scratching her face in anguish.\n\n \n\n\"Why is this happening?\" she wailed.\n\n \n\nTheseus while horrified to see his quest partner die, was determined to retrieve Icarus' body, jumped from the ship and swam to where Icarus fell. The son of Poseidon had no trouble reaching the body, rescuing it from the merciless depths of the sea before the wild creatures that dwelled there could desecrate it. He surfaced, holding Icarus' lifeless form, tears streaming down his face. Theseus jumped into his deck.\n\n \n\n\"I have him,\" Theseus said, his voice choked with emotion.\n\n \n\nThe Fates finally released Apollo, who descended from his chariot into the sea, causing it to boil. He jumped onto the ship and ripped Icarus' body from Theseus' arms.\n\n \n\n\"Give him to me!\" Apollo demanded, his eyes blazing with grief. Theseus tried to reason with Apollo, suggesting they bury Icarus on a nearby island.\n\n \n\n\"We need to bury him, Apollo. Look, there's an island nearby,\" Theseus said, pointing.\n\n \n\nBut Apollo, clutching his lover close, had lost his mind.\n\n \n\n\"No! I won't let him go! He is mine! He has always been mine! And will always be!\" he screamed in grief, golden tears flowing from his blazing golden eyes. Apollo took Icarus' corpse into his sun chariot and left a horrified Theseus, a desperately weeping Ariadne, and a shattered Daedalus behind on the ship. The god's heart was shattered, his mind consumed by the loss of his beloved.\n\n \n\nIn the sun chariot, while clutching Icarus' corpse, Apollo declared to the heavens.\n\n \n\n\"The sea in which Icarus died shall now be known as the Icarian Sea, and the island shall be called Icaria. If the inhabitants agree for their home to bear Icarus' name, I will bless them with good health and longevity, but only as long as Icaria bears the name of my beloved.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, the god returned to his chariot and headed to Delos, leaving behind a scene of grief and despair.\n\n \n\nDaedalus turned to Theseus, his voice trembling and tears continued to fall from his gray eyes. The inventor seemed to have aged a twenty years in the span of an hour.\n\n \n\n\"Please, let me disembark in Icaria. I will stay there to mourn my son and build a monument in his honor.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus nodded solemnly and he gestured his sailors to steer the ship toward the island.\"I promise to take good care of Ariadne and marry her,\" he said, his voice filled with determination.\n\n \n\nDaedalus gave a weak smile, tears still streaming down his face.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you, Prince Theseus. Take care of her. She is dear to me. And she was dearer to my son.\"\n\n \n\nAs the ship sailed towards Icaria, the grief-stricken Daedalus prepared to honor his son's memory, while Theseus and Ariadne faced their own uncertain future. Eventually the ship landed and Daedalus disembarked after saying goodbye to Ariadne. He regretted that he could not stay with her to ensure her future. But looking at the princess, it just made him recall all the times his son was a child and got up to mischief with his best friend, or when the two of them listened to Daedalus as he taught them mathematics. No, Daedalus could not stay close to such a stark reminder. Besides, Prince Theseus and Ariadne were heading to Athens. Daedalus was exiled from Athens for thirty years. It had only been twenty two.\n\n \n\nIn twenty two years, Daedalus had made a home in Crete, had been hit by a love arrow, married Naucrate and created the best boy to ever exist. But the Fates were cruel. They would not allow Daedalus to keep his son. They had first taken his grandson and now his son. Minos was to blame. It was Minos tyranny and carelessness as a ruler that had caused the resentment of Eurytion and his ilk, creating a danger to Alexios. It was the need to escape Minos' wrath that had forced Icarus to commison those horrible wings. One day, Daedalus would get his revenge, but now he must honor his son, carve his memory in stone to echo through the annals of time. Icarus deserved to be remembered, for the whole world to know his name.\n\n \n\n\"My beloved son. You will always be my greatest creation. I am proud to have been your father.\"\n\n \n\n\"Icarus. My greatest creation is you.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~Theseus' ship sailed through the dark waters, its sails billowing in the wind as it made its way to Naxos. The air was heavy with sorrow, for Ariadne had just witnessed the tragic death of her best friend, Icarus. She had locked herself in the cabin, seeking solace in prayer to Hades, hoping that her words might reach the underworld and bring some comfort to Icarus's soul.\n\n \n\nTheseus stood on the deck, his heart aching for Ariadne. He knew she needed space and time to grieve, and he respected her need for solitude. As he gazed out at the horizon, lost in thought, a sudden light appeared before him. It was Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, her presence both awe-inspiring and comforting. Surprised but elated, Theseus bowed to the goddess, the divine patroness of his mortal father's great city.\n\n \n\n\"Theseus,\" Athena spoke, her voice firm yet gentle, \"you cannot bring Ariadne to Athens.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus looked up at the goddess, his brow furrowed in confusion.\n\n \n\n\"But she risked everything to help me. I promised to marry her.I promised to her, to Icarus and to Daedalus. The gods always bide mortals to keep their promises.\"\n\n \n\nAthena's eyes softened with understanding. She smiled at the prince.\n\n \n\n\"I know, Theseus. But Ariadne is the daughter of Minos, whom the Athenians despise. She is also the sister of the Minotaur. If she goes to Athens, it is only a matter of time before someone seeks to harm her. Someone will take her life within the month.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus clenched his fists, torn between his promise and the harsh reality. He did not want to believe that his father's people could be so cruel, so petty and mean spirited as to be threats to Ariadne's safety. But Athena was not just the divine patron of Athens, she was goddess of wisdom and strategy.\n\n \n\n\"What am I to do, then? I cannot just abandon her on Naxos.\"\n\n \n\nAthena placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder.\n\n \n\n\"There are other paths, Theseus. Naxos is a place where she can find peace and safety. You must trust that this is the best course for her.\"\n\n \n\nTheseus shook his head, his voice filled with anguish.\n\n \n\n\"Leaving her on an uninhabited island will also ensure her death. How can I do that to her? And if she dies without anyone to do the rites for her, how will she get to Hades?\"\n\n \n\nAthena's expression remained calm as she continued.\n\n \n\n\"Naxos is sacred to Dionysus, the god of wine and revelry. He often visits the island, and he is in love with Ariadne. She will be better off with a powerful god who can protect and cherish her. If you take her to Athens she will be dead within a month.\"\n\n \n\nAs the ship continued its journey, Theseus pondered Athena's words. He knew that the goddess spoke the truth, but the thought of leaving Ariadne behind filled him with sorrow. Yet, he also understood that true love meant putting her safety above his own desires.\n\n \n\nAs Theseus sailed away to Naxos, incided to commit an act of betrayal for the sake of mercy, Athena watched from the shadows, a sly smile playing on her lips. She reached out and petted her owl, its feathers soft under her fingers.\n\n \n\n\"It is so easy to fool the sons of Poseidon, the overly emotional, impulsive creatures. They have too much of their father in them.\"\n\n \n\nShe murmured to the her owl, the creature most dear to her. The first of its kind, a bird created solely for her by her mighty father.\n\n \n\n\"With Ariadne's financial genius an political expertize, instilled in her by Daedalus himself, Theseus would have had a golden reign and gain renown. But I will not have a son of Poseidon surpass my own kingly son, Erichthonius.\"\n\n \n\nAthena eyed the still black sails, her smile growing wider. A young, untrained king would have quite the uphill battle settling into his crown. It would be even harded if Theseus was grieving both the friend who helped him in the Labyrinth, the woman whom he had to abandon and a father he pushed to suicide. Those sails would stay black, she would ensure it.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, she would need to keep quiet about her excellent strategies and schemes. Apollo, the lovesick fool was on a rampage because his lover had died due to her curse upon the boy's cradle. It would get messy if that rage was directed at her. Her father of course would stand by her as he always did, but it would be inconvenient having to constantly dodge attacks from an irrational Apollo.\n\n \n\n~~~~\n\n \n\nAriadne woke up to the harsh reality of her abandonment. The sun was rising, casting a golden hue over the deserted island. Theseus' ship, Theseus himself and the Athenians she had helped rescue were howere to be seen. She looked around and saw only a few bags of food left for her. The realization hit her like a tidal wave, and she wept and wailed, her cries echoing across the empty shore. Despair consumed her, and she was very tempted to take her own life.\n\n \n\nAs she sat there, lost in her sorrow, a figure appeared before her. A young and beautiful man, his glossy black curls crowned with grape wines, a leopard skin thrown over his purple red chiton. He looked at her with purple eyes full of kindness and compassion. On one hand he held a thyrsus and the other a kantharos.\n\n \n\nIt was Dionysus, the god of wine and revelry. He approached her with a gentle smile and offered her the kantharos full of wine.\n\n \n\n\"Drink, my dear,\" he said softly, his voice tender as she had witnessed Icarus do with frightened baby animals.\n\n \n\nThe crying princess accepted the wine and took a sip. The warmth of the drink spread through her, and she began to tell Dionysus what had happened to her. She spoke of Icarus, her best friend, dearer to her than her own brothers, and how she had watched him fall from the sky and die. Her voice trembled as she recounted the moment her intended, Theseus, had abandoned her, even though she had risked everything to help him. She had braved the horrifying Labyrinth to help him with his quest, had assisted in rescuing the Athenians. But they still abandoned her, left her behind.\n\n \n\nDionysus listened intently, his eyes filled with compassion. When she finished, he gently took her hand and said.\n\n \n\n\"Theseus was a fool to leave you, Ariadne. You deserve so much more than his betrayal.\"\n\n \n\nHe then invited her to his palace in Naxos, offering her friendship and a place to heal. Ariadne dried her tears, a small smile forming on her lips. She took Dionysus's hand, feeling a glimmer of hope for the first time since her abandonment. Together, they walked towards a new beginning, vowing to try and leave the pain of the past behind. Ariadne would always mourn Icarus, but Dionyus was able to make her feel happiness and joy again. He brought color to a world gone dark.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~\n\n \n\nApollo arrived at Delos, his heart heavy with grief and guilt. The cruel laughter of the Fates echoed in his mind, a constant reminder of their merciless decree. They had forced his lover, Icarus, to commit suicide to prevent Apollo from being thrown into Tartarus. The god of light and music wanted nothing more than to curl up and cry, but he knew he had to attend to Icarus first.\n\n \n\nWith trembling hands, Apollo washed Icarus' body and performed the sacred rites, ensuring that his beloved would find peace in Elysium. Once the rites were complete, he transformed Icarus' body into a tree, a living monument to their love. But it was not enough to ease his torment.\n\n \n\nDesperate, Apollo called upon Persephone, granting her permission to come to Delos. The queen of the underworld arrived, her curiosity piqued by Apollo's summons. She looked at the tree and shook her head.\n\n \n\n\"I cannot go against my husband's will and give Icarus back to you,\" she said.\n\n \n\n\"I know that,\" Apollo replied, his voice filled with sorrow.\n\n \n\n\"I want something else from you. I want you to create a connection between the tree and Icarus' soul in the underworld. So when Icarus is reborn, I will be immediately alerted.\"\n\n \n\nPersephone's eyes widened.\n\n \n\n\"You ask a lot, Apollo.\"\n\n \n\n\"You owe me a lot,\" Apollo reminded her.\n\n \n\nHe recounted how, when Adonis died, Hades had been ready to punish the boy harshly for cuckolding him. Zagreus had agreed to reincarnate Adonis immediately as Taleus, the son of Erinoma and Zeus, but Taleus would have still died and fallen back into Hades' grasp. It was Apollo who had transformed the baby boy into an Aurae, a wind nymph, so that he would not end up in Hades' power. Doing so Apollo risked drawing the ire of Aphrodite, who would not be pleased that he helped her rival Persephone keep hold of their shared lover. Apollo also risked the ire of Zeus, who did not like his demigods interfered with and that of Hera, for giving longevity to a son of Zeus. Persephone owed him a lot.\n\n \n\nPersephone sighed, her resolve softening. Her brother had aided her greatly. Much more than she realised back then, in the midst of grief and fear. A favor was owed and a favour would be granted. Persephone knew what it was like to lose a beloved one. Apollo had lost his beloved twice. She knew who Icarus had been.\n\n \n\n\"Very well, I will create the connection. But be careful, Apollo. I raised the reincarnation of Adonis, but the boy Taleus came to see me as a mother, forcing me to give up my feelings for him.\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded. He was aware of this. Artemis had warned him about his tendency of mortal children. With Persephone's warning it made it two. He would not disregard the advice of his twin and his half sister.\n\n \n\n\"I will let my mother Leto raise the third incarnation and only show myself when the new incarnation is fifteen years old. I met both Hyacinthus and Icarus when they were fifteen and they fell in love with me, returning my own feelings.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, Persephone worked her magic, creating the connection between the tree and Icarus' soul. Apollo watched, a glimmer of hope piercing through his grief. He would wait for Icarus' return, ready to protect and love him once more. But hope was not enough. His beloved was gone, cut of from him, in a place where none of Apollo's domains could reach. Not only Icarus was gone, but their beloved son was gone as well. Alexios was dead and Apollo could read between the lines. The Fates had ensured his son's death in order to weaken Icarus with grief and pain, so the horrible choice they inflicted upon him would be easier.\n\nYes, predictable to make Athena the villain. But in Euripides lost play 'Theseus' she was the one to urge Theseus to abandon Ariadne.\n\nI wanted to keep both Theseus and Dionysus innocent on Ariadne's abandonment. Theseus is a son of Poseidon, they tend to have loyalty as their fatal flaw. At this point he is a young and fairly idealistic (for his time) boy. He would not voluntarily abandon someone that helped him so much and who had just lost her best friend. So Athena gets to be the villain.\n\nIn some versions it is Dionysus who forces Theseus to abandon Ariadne, but I could not do that to my girl Ariadne. She deserves better than a husband who started their relationship as a lie. So Dionysus gets to be Ariadne's hero and given that he has no idea that Athena was involved, he is justified in his hatred of Theseus, but not Theseus' siblings. That is just Mr. D being petty.\n\nArtemis reacts to the Fates mandated fall.\n\nPercy learns the politics of keeping her alive.\n\nCabin 5 wants to know about Sparta\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nIn the forest of Camp Half-Blood, Percy Jackson, the third reincarnation of Prince Hyacinthus, stood before Artemis, her memories of past lives swirling in her mind. She had once been Icarus of Crete, raised partially by Artemis, who had loved her like a son. Now, as Percy, she faced the goddess again, but this time with the weight of her past lives pressing down on her. If there was one benefit to having strong relationships with gods, was that she was guaranteed to meet them in each life and they would still be the same, more or less. Seeing Artemis brought back all the cherished memories of her childhood as Icarus. While Minos and his monster had cast a large and dark pall, Artemis had made Icarus feel safe and she had always been there for him. Icarus had been devoted to Artemis not as just his patron goddess, but also as a mother figure. Artemis along with Ariadne, had been the two most important women in Icarus' life. The respect he had held for them persisted in Percy.\n\n \n\nWhen Percy arrived at Camp Half-Blood, she remembered everything. The memories of her life as Hyacinthus, the beloved of Apollo, and her tragic fall as Icarus, were vivid and painful. Meeting Artemis again brought a flood of emotions, but it was Apollo's slip that changed everything.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus was forced by the Fates to fall from the sky,\" Apollo had said, his voice heavy with regret.\n\n \n\nArtemis' eyes blazed with fury. Percy was reminded of the few times she had seen the goddess angry. The first time was when a strange and unsavory man had tried to furtively follow Icarus into the woods. Icarus, how had learned tracking and stealth in Artemis' knee from the age of four, immediately spotted him and prayed to the goddess. Artemis had spoken in his mind and told Icarus to lead the man to her. Once there, Artemis had slowly and painfully transformed the man into a platypus. The other time was when Aura had done the unthinkable and questioned Artemis' virtue. Polyboea had quickly ushered Icarus away.\n\n \n\n\"I thought it was the curse of that unknown foul god that caused his fall,\" she spat, her voice trembling with anger.\n\n \n\nPercy took a deep breath, ready to explain.\n\n \n\n\"It wasn't just the curse, Artemis. The Fates appeared to me shortly after the murder of Alexios, mine and Apollo's son. They were furious that Apollo tried to defy them to save Icarus from the curse. They gave me an ultimatum: either I died while Apollo watched, or they would throw Apollo into Tartarus for all eternity.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis' face paled, her anger giving way to shock.\n\n \n\n\"You.. Icarus had no true choice,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible.\n\n \n\nPercy nodded. The hardest thing had not been choosing to die, since there was no other choice to make. But keeping it hidden from his loved ones. Apollo, Daedalus and Ariadne had of course noticed but they had thought it was because of Alexios.\n\n \n\n\"He chose to die, to let his wings burn and fall into the sea, to save Apollo and the world.\"\n\n \n\nPolyboea, Hyacinthus' younger sister, and Phoebe, a Cretan girl rescued by Icarus, listened intently. Polyboea had a death grip on her bow, her eyes wet with tears and her lips quivering. Phoebe just looked furious, clutching her bow as if wanting to go hunt the Fates for sport. Zoe Nightshade, Artemis' lieutenant who had joined the Hunt shortly after Icarus' death, stood silently, her eyes filled with suprise. The former disdain was quite reduced. She looked at Percy as if she did not know what to make of her.\n\n \n\nArtemis was speechless, her fury now directed at the Fates.\n\n \n\n\"It's not safe to defy the Fates. They will win in the end and cause such suffering to ensure that the lesson sinks,\" Percy cautioned gently, her voice filled with understanding.\n\n \n\nReluctantly, Artemis agreed.\n\n \n\n\"We need to keep you alive until you turn sixteen,\" she said, her voice firm.\n\n \n\n\"Then we can feed you a golden apple or make you drink from the chalice of immortality.\"\n\nApollo nodded at his sister, his golden eyes blazing with ferocious determination. Percy, puzzled, looked between them.\n\n \n\n\"What are you talking about? What is so special about me turning sixteen?\" she asked, her voice tinged with confusion.\n\n \n\nArtemis placed a hand on Percy's shoulder.\n\n \n\n\"We, Apollo, myself and Poseidon will do whatever it takes to protect you, Percy. You are more important than you realize.\"\n\n \n\nApollo stepped forward, his expression serious and vaguely afraid. Percy's heart stuttered, she had seen Apollo afraid only twice. When the disc had struck and when the wings had burned.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, there's something you need to know. After World War II, a prophecy was made. It spoke of a half-blood child of the Big Three who, at the age of sixteen, would make a choice to either preserve or destroy Olympus. That's why Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades swore an oath on the Styx not to have any more demigod children.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's eyes widened in horror.\n\n \n\n\"Destroy Olympus? But Olympus is the pillar and foundation that holds up civilization. I would never seek the destruction of the gods. Apollo, you are the love of my lives, and Artemis, you are like a mother to me. I also dearly love Clio, my first mother. Ariadne, my sister in everything other than blood. And I am fond enough of Poseidon not to want his destruction.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis and Apollo exchanged a glance, their expressions filled with determination and resolve.\n\n \n\n\"We will protect you, Percy,\" Artemis said firmly.\"No matter what it takes.\"\n\n \n\nPolyboea noticed Percy's omission and asked Apollo, \"Have you not told Percy about Asclepius yet?\"\n\n \n\nApollo sighed.\n\n \n\n\"Percy has had so many shocks in such a short time.\"\n\n \n\nPercy felt deeply confused. She knew who Asclepius was, Chiron had covered him in the classics classes. Percy also held his mythomagic card.\n\n \n\n\"Why do I need to know about Princess Coronis' son?\"\n\n \n\nApollo grimaced as Polyboea and Artemis glared at him.\n\n \n\n\"Coronis was just the surrogate. Asclepius was created from the combining my essence with that of and the original hyacinth flower. Asclepius is not the son of Coronis but of Hyacinthus. Asclepius is our son, Percy.\"\n\n \n\nPercy felt her knees buckle and fell down in shock. Apollo immediately caught her.\n\n \n\n\"How?\" she stuttered. \"And why didn't Asclepius inherit the Kingdom of Sparta?\"\n\n \n\nPolyboea explained, \"Apollo petitioned Zeus, but Zeus objected because mortals would have had trouble understanding. Asclepius was born over ten years after your death and Coronis' idiocy of cheating on a god spread far and wide, making everyone believe that Asclepius was hers.\"\n\n \n\nApollo hissed in fury. The slight to his beloved son still rankled.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus denied Sparta to the rightful heir, Asclepius, and then a hundred years later gave Sparta to Helen, his whore of a daughter!\"\n\n \n\nPercy, still reeling from the revelation, looked up at Apollo and Artemis.\n\n \n\n\"What do we do now?\" She said, wondering about Asclepius and when she would get to meet him, her firstborn son.\n\n \n\nArtemis and Apollo exchanged a determined glance.\n\n \n\n\"We protect you, Percy,\" Artemis said firmly.\n\n \n\n\"No matter what it takes.\" Apollo confirmed.\n\n \n\nArtemis recounted how the council would be divided on the matter of Percy and the prophecy.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo, myself, Poseidon, Dionysus, Hermes, and Aphrodite will vote to keep you alive.\"The goddess ticked off each god with her fingers.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo, I, and Poseidon for obvious reasons.\" Artemis smiled slightly.\n\n \n\n\"Dionysus because Ariadne was Icarus' best friend and she has a deep attachment to you. He would do anything for his wife.\"\n\n \n\n\"Except not cheat on her with wood nymphs and have demigods.\"Groused Percy. Still unhappy at those revelations even if Ariadne did not seem that concerned. In fact, Ariadne had asked her to be kind to Dionysus' two sons. Apparently due to their father being so awful to the campers, the two boys were fairly isolated.\n\n \n\nArtemis rolled her eyes at Percy's words, her expression screaming: Men, what can you do.\n\n \n\n\"Hermes is Apollo's favorite brother and vice versa,\" Artemis continued, before her face twisted in distaste.\n\n \n\n\"Aphrodite has always thought that Apollo and Hyacinthus were peak romance. She loved the first two runs of their reincarnation love story and is eagerly waiting to watch the third re-run.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis looked like she was badly in need of mouthwash. Percy recalled the many rants about Aphrodite that she had heard in her second life.\n\n \n\n\"Unfortunately, Zeus, Athena, and Ares will vote to kill you. Zeus has grown too paranoid, Athena because she is strategic and cautious, and Ares because he loves war and chaos.\"\n\n \n\n\"Demeter will stay neutral. She is not fond of Poseidon but does not want Apollo to scorch crops in a rage and damage her domain. Hera appreciated Hyacinthus' respect for the sanctity of marriage but will likely stay neutral to not fully go against her husband. Hephaestus will either be neutral or side with keeping you alive because he does not want another civilization collapse. His domains and followers fared very poorly until the world recovered from Apollo's wrath.\"\n\n \n\n\"That will give us a majority.\" The goddess of the Hunt spoke, hope infusing her voice.\n\n \n\nApollo vowed, \"If something happens to you, the Ancient Greek Dark Age and the Late Bronze Era Collapse that I caused due to the death of Icarus will be child's play compared to what I will do this time. I was not actually trying back then. It was just collateral damage. My father and Athena need a reminder of that!\"\n\n \n\nPercy hugged him to calm him down, feeling the weight of her past lives and the love and support of those around her. Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, determined to protect Percy and preserve the future of Olympus.\n\n \n\n\"The prophecy might not be about me anyway.\" She told Apollo, who looked sceptical.\n\n \n\nShe smiled at him.\"Can I meet Asclepius?\" She asked.\n\n \n\nApollo winced.\n\n \n\n\"We might need to wait a bit. My father is still furious. Artemis and I might get way with a lot due to our positions, but our son is a minor god. Clio also wants to meet you but is holding back so Zeus does not take umbrage and does something rash.\"\n\n \n\n~~~~\n\n \n\nPercy walked into the armory of Camp Half-Blood. She carried her trusty sword, Riptide, and the Hephaestus-forged bow and quiver that Artemis, her patron goddess in her second life as Icarus, had returned to her. Though she was well-armed, Percy knew that a few hidden daggers never went to waste.\n\n \n\nAs she entered the armory, she spotted Clarisse La Rue, the daughter of Ares. Clarisse glared at her, still holding a grudge from Percy's first day at camp when she had killed two boars in the forest. Boars were sacred to Ares, and Clarisse had been offended. She had tried to give Percy a swirlie in the girl's toilets, but Percy had used her water powers to give Clarisse a toilet water shower instead.\n\n \n\nDetermined to make peace, Percy approached Clarisse.\n\n \n\n\"Do you want to brag?\" Clarisse asked, her tone sharp.\n\n \n\n\"No,\" Percy replied calmly. \"I want to ask you about a truce.\"Clarisse was taken aback and suspicion filled her eyes.\n\n \n\n\"A truce? Why?\"\n\n \n\nPercy took a deep breath to explain.\n\n \n\n\"I killed the boars because I was deeply unsettled and confused from having the memories of my two lives crash on me. Hunting always helped me sort out difficult feelings in my past lives. I went for boars because, while they are edible animals, they are also majestic, ferocious, and strong--a challenge to hunt.\"\n\n \n\n\"All of Sparta, Ares' patron city, hunted boars regularly. Cattle was too precious to be slaughtered on the regular so almost everyone ate boar meat daily. Ares was never offended.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse's curiosity was piqued.\n\n \n\n\"Tell me more about Ancient Sparta.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, smiling as she reminisced about her beloved city.\n\n \n\n\"We started training the boys rigorously from the moment they could walk. The city didn't have walls, so we needed the people to be the walls.\"\n\n \n\n\"What about the girls?\" Clarisse asked.She grimaced, while even as a male of privilege Percy had always been aware of the plight of women, it really hit different when Percy herself was a born female.\n\n \n\n\"While Sparta was better than the rest of Ancient Greece about the rampant misogyny, we still weren't perfect. Spartan girls were taught some combat, mostly so they would be strong and healthy and thus give birth to strong, healthy sons. Hyacinthus' eldest sisters knew some basic dagger work but their mother did not let them learn more. Hyacinthus personally trained his little sister Polyboea, who became good enough to become a Hunter of Artemis and she still lives. Hyacinthus' female best friend, Smilax, the daughter of Aphrodite, was quite skilled with a spear, even if she preferred to use her Charmspeak to make her attackers kill themselves. If she liked the chiton she was wearing she ordered them to slit their own throat as not to get blood on it. If she did not, she slaughtered whoever dared to attack her and then commisioned a new bolt of cloth from her maidservants. Occasionally I was able to sneak her into a hunt and she did manage to bring down a boar by herself once.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse's eyes widened, a smile creeping up on her face.\n\n \n\n\"The Aphrodite cabin would like to hear about Smilax, especially my best friend Silena. What happened to her?\"\n\n \n\nPercy's expression grew sad.\n\n \n\n\"Smilax ran afoul of a god who killed her and transformed her into a shrub. She died before Hyacinthus. Smilax was betrothed to Hyacinthus' male best friend, Crocus, son of Poseidon.\"Clarisse recognized the name.\n\n \n\n\"Crocus? I heard from Chris Rodrigues from Hermes Cabin that Crocus was a lover of Hermes. Hyacinthus, Smilax, and Crocus--all best friends ended up becoming plants. The Spartan Flower Gang.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled faintly, recalling the happy times with her once closest friends .before tragedy struck and took Smilax from them.\n\n \n\n\"Yes, the Spartan Flower Gang.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse looked at Percy with newfound respect.\n\n \n\n\"Maybe we can work on that truce after all.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse then asked, \"What are you looking for?\"\n\n \n\nPercy replied, \"I want a couple of daggers to keep hidden as a last resort weapon.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse led her to a chest of drawers and picked up a shiny parazonium blade with a polished wooden handle gingerly with two fingers. Percy took it from Clarisse, the handle fitting perfectly in her hand. Clarisse grimaced at the blade.\n\n \n\n\"Why don't you like the dagger? Seems excellent quality to me.\"\n\n \n\nPercy asked, while testing the weight of the weapon and testing the sharp blade on a nearby piece of wood.\n\n \n\nClarisse snorted in both amusement and annoyance,\n\n \n\n\"It's called Katoptris, and it used to belong to Helen of Troy. Or rather, Helen of Sparta.\"\n\n \n\nPercy chuckled.\n\n \n\n\"Troy is more than welcome to keep Helen. I don't want her in my city thank you very much!\"\n\n \n\nClarisse broke into a full throated laughter full of gleeful mirth.\n\n \n\n\"If only Menelaus had the good sense to do that! But then the most awesome war in history would not have happened.\"\n\n \n\n\"The blade is difficult and picky, only wanting to be wielded by the most beautiful of mortals.\" Clarisse clarified about the dagger.\n\n \n\nPercy rolled her eyes. Clarisse, who was considered unattractive by some, would kill to have a fraction of Percy's good looks.\n\n \n\nPercy told her, \"You're not ugly. And being beautiful is not all it's cracked up to be. People stare, behave in creepy ways, and even murder out of misplaced jealousy.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse recalled the misdirected murderous discus.\n\n \n\n\"I supposed when someone goes and murders you for being too pretty it really sucks something fierce.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded and added, \"It's better in modern times. Restraining orders exist now, and it's socially unacceptable to comment on a child's looks. Back in Sparta people would be creepy even when I was a little kid. In Crete at least I was under Artemis' protection. I think she might have killed a bunch of jerks when I was little but few bothered me, thank the goddess of the hunt. What is important is to be strong.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse nodded thoughtfully, and the two girls shared a moment of understanding.\n\n \n\nPercy noticed a black dagger which she recognized as Stygian Iron. As Icarus, she was good friends and quest partners with a son of Hades, Nicodemos. Nicodemos had a sword made of Stygian Iron. Icarus was unable to even touch it since it could only be wielded by descendants of underworld deities. Percy brushed her hand over the dagger and, to her surprise and Clarisse's, she was able to touch it.\n\n \n\nClarisse gave her a weird look.\n\n \n\n\"That's not possible. You're Poseidon's daughter.\"\n\n \n\nPercy replied, \"It's possible that my mother Sally is descended from an underworld deity. Also, it could be because as a reincarnated soul, I remember being a denizen of the Underworld.\"Clarisse told her, \"Don't show it around. A couple of kids in the Hermes cabin can touch Stygian Iron, but they end up feared by the rest.\"\n\n \n\nPercy eyed the dagger with trepidation, not sure what it meant that she was able to touch it. But the part of her that was Icarus was glad to have something in common with Nicodemos, his trusty friend.\n\n \n\n\"I will do that.\" She told Clarisse. Percy sheathed both daggers and stashed them in her backpack.\n\n \n\nThey heard the conch shell sound, signaling that lunch was about to be served. Percy and Clarisse headed to the dining area. Clarisse asked, \"Will you be eating alone at Poseidon's table or with Will at the Apollo table?\"\n\n \n\nPercy replied, \"Both. Will and I will dine on alternate days at both Poseidon's table and Apollo's table. I can't neglect my father but also I want to eat meals with my own son.\"\n\n \n\nAs Percy and Clarisse walked back, drawing surprised stares from people around them, Percy told Clarisse more about ancient Sparta, and Clarisse listened raptly. Percy was describing melas zomos, Spartan Black Broth, when Elis Wakefield, one of Clarisse's brothers, joined the conversation.\n\n \n\n\"I've heard about the black broth, but most writers say it's ghastly,\" Elis said.\n\n \n\nPercy laughed. \"It depends on the cook. It's basically a soup made with pork meat, pork blood, vinegar, salt, onion, and various herbs for seasoning. As Hyacinthus, I found it quite delicious and ate it almost every day, especially after injuries. While nectar and ambrosia healed the damage, it was a good idea to replenish lost blood.\"\n\n \n\nElis asked, \"Why did everyone other than the Spartans find it so ghastly then?\"\n\n \n\nPercy replied, \"Most surviving writings about Ancient Greece are from Athens, and Athenians have always been whiny babies. It might not look pretty, but it's still good nutritious food.\"\n\n \n\nElis noticed the look of distaste when Percy mentioned Athenians and asked her.\n\n \n\n\"Do you hate Athenians because you were the Crown Prince of Sparta or because you are now a child of Poseidon?\"\n\n \n\nPercy told him, \"It's both for those reasons and because of the two Athenians I personally met as Icarus.\"\n\n \n\nElis guessed, \"One of them was Theseus, right? Was Icarus really in the Labyrinth with Theseus and Ariadne? During a Winter Solstice, I overheard Ariadne talk about it with Clio.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded. \"Yes, Icarus was in the Labyrinth.\"\n\n \n\nShe told him succinctly, not wanting to dwell on that horrible night and the even more horrible day that had followed. Percy did not want to relieve the fall.\n\n \n\nElis asked, \"Who was the other Athenian you hate?\"\n\n \n\nPercy stopped suddenly, recalling Alkinoos, Daedalus' ambitious brother who had Icarus' son Alexios murdered.She fought down the rage and grief that the memory never failed to bring up and told Elis.\n\n \n\n\"I would prefer that particular Athenian to be Damnatio memoriae if possible.\"\n\n \n\nElis asked, \"What is damnatio memoriae?\"\n\n \n\nPercy replied, \"It's Latin. You can ask Chiron what it means because Chiron taught me Latin.\"\n\n \n\nWill cheerfully called Percy over. Percy said goodbye to Clarisse and Elis and ran to Will.Percy said goodbye to Clarisse and Elis and ran to Will. Clarisse called out,\"You'll need to tell the Aphrodite cabin all about Smilax.\"\n\n \n\nPercy called back, \"We can do that after lunch.\"\n\n \n\nPercy noticed Chiron startle at the mention of Smilax's name and couldn't help but feel vindicated. She would definitely tell Smilax's siblings all about her.\n\nClarisse was supposed to stay in the background until Sea of Monsters but I decided to give her some screen time before that. Besides, what child of Ares would not be at least a bit curious about a reborn Spartan Prince?\n\nPercy tells the Aphrodite cabin about Smilax.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nPercy Jackson sat at Apollo's table with her son, Will. The dining area of Camp Half-Blood buzzed with the usual chatter and laughter of demigods. It was her first formal meal at camp, and she felt a mix of nostalgia and unease. As the campers began to prepare their offerings to the gods, Percy noticed something that made her blood run cold.\n\n \n\nThe campers were only preparing offerings for a select few Olympians, neglecting the others. Percy knew from her past lives as Prince Hyacinthus and Icarus, Apollo's true love, that failing to honor all twelve Olympians could bring about divine wrath. A certain monstrous boar was inflicted upon Calydonia because the king neglected to sacrifice to Artemis. As Icarus, Percy had heard about Artemis herself about that. The goddess had been angry, offended and hurt. Artemis had ensured that the forests of Calydonia were flush with game, that their maidens had her protection and that their mothers survived childbirth and the king did not even offer her proper due.\n\n \n\nPercy stood up abruptly, her chair scraping against the ground.\n\n \n\n\"What in Tartarus is going on?\" she demanded, her voice echoing through the dining area.\n\n \n\n\"Chiron, have you not taught these demigods the proper way to give offerings and sacrifices? Have you not taught my son?\"\n\n \n\nChiron, centaur and camp director, looked up from his meal, his brow furrowing in confusion.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, what do you mean?\"\n\n \n\nPercy gestured to the campers.\n\n \n\n\"They're not preparing offerings to all twelve Olympians! This was a standing tradition in ancient times, you yourself told me that back then. Failing to do so usually brought divine punishments. Do you not remember the Calydonian Boar and all the other disasters unleashed everytime some moron left out an Olympian god out of the roll call during sacrifices?\"\n\n \n\nDionysus, the camp's resident god, perked up at her words.\n\n \n\n\"I thought it was just the demigods being rude and ungrateful since the rise of Christianity,\" he said, his tone dripping with sarcasm and anger. Percy eyed him with unease. Dionysus had been in camp for years and had watched demigods make offerings and far too many times leave him out of it. Did anyone other than his own sons burn him offerings? Had the god of madness cursed anyone at camp for these daily insults? She did not want to ask Dionysus directly as not to further provoke him, but she would definitely ask Ariadne next time her friend visited.\n\n \n\nChiron sighed, rubbing his temples. \"Times have changed, Percy. The traditions have evolved.\"\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head, her eyes blazing with determination. She pointed at the scowling Dionysus.\n\n \n\n\" Have you gone senile! The Olympian god right there thinks we are rude and ungratefull!\"\n\n \n\nShe looked at Clarisse on the fifth table. The other girl had told her about how fraught and dangerous her journey to camp had been. Then at Dionysus.\n\n \n\n\"Is this why there are so many monster attacks on demigods?\" She shakily asked, clutching her son.\n\n \n\nDionysus sighed, banging a can of Diet Coke on his table, making the liquid splash. He seemed to be trembling with rage. Percy stepped in front of Will, no wanting her child on the sight of an angry god.\n\n \n\n\"I have not sent any in almost fifteen hundred years, since it was not making a difference. I just drunk myself into a stuppor and ignored the insults. I don't know about the rest. I have not asked them. A bit of a sore subject as you can well imagine. Not only the mortals think we are figments of some bard's imagination but even our children, siblings and cousins ignore and disrespect us.\"\n\n \n\nPercy turned to glare at Chiron, whose duty was to teach demigods.\n\n \n\n\"Even back then, Chiron, you only truly bothered with your favorites, spoiled them rotten to the detriment of everyone else. I remember well, Smilax had to take matters into her own hands to keep herself and her sisters safe.\"\n\n \n\nWill, her son, placed a hand on her arm. \"Mom, maybe we can teach them the old ways. Show them why it's important.\"\n\n \n\nPercy then turned to her son Will and his siblings. She put down a platter and began showing them how to prepare sacrifices.\n\n \n\n\"Meat usually works best, but not everyone can afford it. But peasant families back then usually just cut up a piece of flatbread in twelve parts and offered that since they had nothing else. Or twelve wild berries.\" she explained. She grabbed a large piece of meat and made twelve cubes out of it.\n\n \n\n\"All twelve Olympians must get something, but you can make your divine parent's pieces larger, same with other gods you are more familiar or closer to.\"\n\n \n\nIn Percy's platter, Poseidon, Apollo, and Artemis had larger pieces. She added a thirteenth piece for Hestia. Then she prepared a second row in her platter. The first to go were Nike and Tyche, the goddesses of Victory and Luck, whose domains were vital to demigods. She then added Zagreus, the god of rebirth, since he granted Icarus' request of giving back Alexios as Will. Finally, she added a piece for Hades, because her mother Sally was in Hades' kingdom. And finally Asclepius, her firstborn son. She wanted him to know that she held him in her thoughts.\n\n \n\nWill copied her, making the exact same offerings. Will's siblings followed her template. All twelve Olympians first, followed by Hestia and then any minor gods that the demigods wanted to honor. The boys had Apollo's porton larger than the rest, the girls also gave Artemis a larger piece along with their father. They all prepared offerings to Nike and Tyche, much to Percy's relief. Having Nike's and Tyche's favour could mean life and death for a demigod. It had likely been due to Hyacinthus' regular offerings to Tyche that Crocus had returned early that night, thousands of years ago.\n\n \n\nAthena's table, closest to Apollo's looked torn on what to do, not wanting to listen to a child of Poseidon, but other tables began copying their actions. Percy was happy to see Clarisse follow the offering template, even if the other girl's offering to her father Ares was comically large compared to the rest of her offerings. Clarisse was definitely a bit of a daddy's girl. Percy hoped that Ares appreciated his daughter's devotion.\n\n \n\nPercy took her platter to the hearth and dropped each piece of food in the fire while saying the name of the respective god. It rankled to sacrifice to Athena of all gods, but needs must. She prayed in apology to her father. Athena's piece was slightly smaller than the rest. Alkinoos' mother would get the bare minimum and nothing else from Percy. Just so she did not have grounds to whine about it.\n\n \n\nAfter the sacrifices, they started eating. Just like Percy, Will avoided olives. Victoria tried to give them some, but both mother and son made identical expressions of disgust. Lee Fletcher laughed at that.\n\n \n\nMichael started to discuss the game of Capture the Flag in two days. He wanted to know if Percy would ally with them. Percy told him that she had no intention of playing against Will. Michael then told her that they were allied with Ares, Aphrodite, and Demeter.\n\n \n\nAfter lunch, Clarisse arrived at Apollo's table with a very beautiful girl about fifteen years old. Clarisse introduced her as Silena, the counselor of the Aphrodite cabin. Silena smiled and invited Percy to her cabin so she could tell them about Smilax of Sparta, daughter of Aphrodite and best friend of Prince Hyacinthus.\n\n \n\nWill's eyes lit up with curiosity. \"Can I come too? I want to learn about Mom's best friend in ancient times.\"\n\n \n\nSilena nodded warmly. \"Of course, Will. You're welcome to join us.\"\n\n \n\nPercy along with her son Will, followed Silena and Clarisse to the Aphrodite cabin. The cabin had a painted roof, pillars, and a blue-and-white checkerboard deck with steps, a pink door, and gray walls. Inside, it was very pink but also fashionable and tasteful. Percy, Will, Clarisse, Silena, Drew, Mitchel, Lacy, and Valentina, along with nine more girls and four more boys, took their seats as Percy began to tell the story of Smilax.\n\n \n\n\"Smilax was born to a wealthy Spartan nobleman and Aphrodite,\" Percy began.\n\n \n\n\"Her father was very ambitious and aimed to make her queen, so he ensured she was always in my path. Although I did not feel attracted to Smilax, we became good friends. Unlike most girls who giggled and stammered around me, Smilax was funny and observant, which I appreciated. I grew fond of her, almost as fond as I was of Polyboea, my little sister.\"\n\n \n\nKing Amyclas realized Smilax's father's intentions and limited their time together, as he wanted to match Hyacinthus with Princess Danae of Argos.\n\n \n\n\"Even at a young age, Smilax had powerful Charmspeak, excellent sensory amokinesis, and was skilled with a spear,\" Percy continued.\n\n \n\n\"She was invited and went to Chiron's camp at twelve, a year before me. I was one year younger than her. She was accompanied by another Spartan demigod, Crocus, the son of Poseidon.\"\n\n \n\nOne of the girls, about Percy's age, Drew Tanaka, interrupted, \"Wait, Crocus? Isn't he Hermes' favorite lover?\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, a wave of sadness crashing down on her as she recalled her best friend, her brother. Thanks to her father she had about a billion brothers, but Crocus would always be her favorite.\n\n \n\n\"That came later. During her first year at camp, Smilax faced many challenges. In ancient times, it was extremely difficult to be a girl, especially a beautiful one. Smilax was nearly assaulted by a son of Zeus but used her Charmspeak to escape. She discovered that many of her sisters were not as fortunate. The culprits were sons of Zeus, almost every one of them.\" She snarled.\n\n \n\nPercy shoot a look at Clarisse.\n\n \n\n\"And a few sons of Ares.\"\n\n \n\nAll the Aphrodite campers and Clarisse looked angry.\n\n \n\n\"Crocus stayed close to Smilax to ensure her safety, he got in so many fights, but the experience traumatized her. She was terrified, extremely angry and wanted revenge. She wanted revenge something fierce.\" Percy said.\n\n \n\n\"The following year, Smilax hatched a plan. She learned from a relative that the Oracle of Delphi had declared Medusa would be killed by a son of Zeus of Spartan blood. Princess Danae, the mother of Perseus, was the daughter of King Amyclas' sister Eurydice.\"\n\n \n\nDrew made a face, modern sensibilities grossing her out on ancient practices.\n\n\"King Amyclas wanted to marry his son to his niece?\"\n\n \n\nPercy winced and explained,\n\n \n\n\"It was normal for royalty back then. Before Perseus, there was no son of Zeus with Spartan blood. Sparta was too close to Argos, and we were Hera's second favorite city after Argos, and she kept a close watch. Smilax told the Zeus campers that the Oracle had said Medusa would be slain by a son of Zeus, goading them into going after Medusa. She left out the part about the son of Zeus being of Spartan blood. Naturally, the arrogant, entitled brats thought the prophecy was about them and went after Medusa, never to return.\"\n\n \n\nThe room fell silent as the campers absorbed the story. Percy looked around at the attentive faces and smiled.\n\n \n\n\"Smilax was a true hero, and her story deserves to be remembered.\"\n\n \n\nPercy continued,\n\n \n\n\"After camp, I, Crocus, and Smilax returned to Sparta. Smilax, who was very good at reading people and detecting political machinations, became my' unofficial advisor. Smilax's father still wanted her to marry me, so we pretended it was a slight option until Crocus could gain enough power and status to be a suitable suitor for Smilax. This happened after Crocus' grandfather died, and Crocus inherited everything. Crocus and Smilax became formally betrothed and were supposed to get married when Smilax turned eighteen. They were fourteen when they were betrothed. I know, very young, but that was how it was and we had to prevent Smilax father from selling her to the highest bidder. She and Crocus loved each other, and the most important thing was that Crocus respected her and he did believe in misogyny.\"\n\n \n\n\"Unfortunately, Smilax died three years later,\" Percy said softly.\n\n \n\n\"But before her death, she lived a wonderful life. She advised the crown prince and was betrothed to one of the most powerful young noblemen in Sparta. Since her father never got over Aphrodite and got married she also had full control over his household, which gave her a lot of clout with the other noblewomen.\"\n\n \n\n\"Given the dangerous times and the lack of walls, Smilax often made use of either her spear or her powers to deal with attackers and enemies.\"\n\n \n\nPercy paused, then continued,\n\"One time, Crocus, Smilax and I were on a pilgrimage to a countryside temple of Pan. We were attacked by bandits. Crocus and I were ready to fight, but Smilax did not want to be late or get blood on her beautiful peplos, so she just ordered the bandits to slit their own throats. Normally, she preferred to be subtler about her powers since people would have grown hysterical about a woman with mind control powers.\"\n\n \n\nSilena asked, \"How did Smilax die?\"\n\n \n\nPercy's eyes watered. She couldn't tell them the truth, that Aphrodite killed her in anger, because they would freak out. Instead, she said,\n\n \n\n\"An unknown god killed Smilax and transformed her into a shrub. Crocus placed the shrub in the gardens of his mansion. I took a few cuttings to plant in the palace gardens and into the wild. The Smilax shrub proved resilient. When Hyacinthus was reborn as Icarus about one hundred years later, the Smilax shrub had spread as far as Crete. Icarus found the demigod Miletus near a Smilax shrub after the baby had been exposed by his vicious mother.\"\n\n \n\nThe campers nodded, understanding the resilience and strength of their ancient Spartan sister.\n\n \n\nDrew, eager for more information about ancient tragic love stories, leaned forward.\n\n \n\n\"What about Smilax's fiance, Crocus? I've heard he became Hermes' favorite lover.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, grateful for the change in topic.\n\n \n\n\"A few months after Smilax died, Crocus was still utterly devastated. He met Hermes, who helped him deal with his grief. Slowly, Crocus fell in love with Hermes. Hermes was the only one who could make Crocus laugh after Smilax's death. By the time Hyacinthus died, Crocus and Hermes had been together for nearly four years.\"\n\n \n\nMitchell, looking rather skeptical, pointed out,\n\n \n\n\"It's unusual for gods to stay with a mortal lover for that long.\"\n\n \n\nPercy shrugged, wondering if it had something to do with the Poseidon bloodline. She herself had always had Poseidon's ichor in her veins, in all her three lives.\n\n \n\n\"Crocus was the son of Poseidon. Maybe that had something to do with it.\"\n\n \n\nShe paused, her mind drifting to the past.\n\n \n\n\"I always wondered why Crocus and Hermes would be messing around with a discus after what happened with Apollo and me. Hermes is the god of athletes and the divine patron of the games; there's no way he would miss a throw.\"\n\n \n\nDrew chimed in, \"In some tellings, Hyacinthus' death was purely an accident rather than the truth of Zephyrus murdering him out of jealousy by misdirecting the discus. Could it have been the same with Crocus? Could someone have redirected Hermes' discus?\"\n\n \n\nPercy scowled at the mention of that gods name but shook her head, not wanting to believe that her best friend, her brother had been murdered just like she had.\n\n \n\n\"I have no idea. Crocus outlived me, and I don't know by how much. The only person who would know is Hermes.\"\n\n \n\nShe remembered meeting Hermes a couple of times as Icarus. Both times, Hermes had crocus flowers either in his hair or held them in his hands, always looking sadly at the flowers. Icarus had never dared to ask why, but now Percy wished she had. The mystery of Crocus' fate lingered in her mind, a puzzle she might never solve. She wondered if Apollo knew what had happened and if he would be willing to tell her. The only other option would be to ask Hermes and she had a feeling that would be a horrible idea.\n\n \n\nClarisse sat up, breaking the contemplative silence.\n\n \n\n\"As much as I enjoyed hearing about a badass woman in ancient times, we have to prepare for Capture the Flag.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, snapping back to the present.\n\n \n\n\"Right. What's the plan?\"\n\n \n\nClarisse grumbled,\n\n \n\n\"All the strategists are in Athena's cabin. It gives them a huge advantage.\"\n\n \n\nPercy raised an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n\"Why is that? Anyone can learn strategy.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse looked at her strangely.\n\n \n\n\"Athena is the goddess of strategy. All her children are strategists.\"\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head. This was more Chiron giving unfair advantages to his favorites and damn everyone else.\n\n \n\n\"Not necessarily. Daedalus, son of Athena, didn't have any talent for strategy. He was a genius inventor, sculptor, architect, shipbuilder, polyglot, but he never drew up a strategy in his life. Crete's top strategist was Alastor, head priest and son of Ares. Alastor worked with Daedalus to construct a temple of Ares in the Port of Knossos that also served as a defensive structure during pirate attacks or attempted naval invasions by other kingdoms. While Daedalus was happy to provide Alastor with spyglasses to watch for suspicious ships, barrels of Greek fire, and catapult weapons, he left the strategy to Alastor.\"\n\n \n\nPercy continued, \"Daedalus let Alastor train me every three days. All households in Crete were supposed to send at least one son to train with Alastor and the rest of the priests every three days. When there was an attack, which happened a few times a year because Crete, especially Knossos, was quite rich, the temple of Ares rang the war bells. Every able-bodied male from the ages of fifteen to fifty had to don armor and weapons and hurry to receive orders from Alastor.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse listened, her expression thoughtful.\n\n \n\n\"So, you're saying we don't need to rely solely on Athena's cabin for strategy?\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded.\n\n \n\n\"Exactly. We can come up with our own strategies. We just need to think creatively and work together.\"\n\n \n\nClarisse grinned, a spark of determination in her eyes.\n\n \n\n\"Alright, let's do this. Capture the Flag, here we come!\"\n\n \n\nClarisse called for a meeting to discuss their strategies for Capture the Flag at the Ares Cabin. It was tightly packed with all the Ares, Aphrodite, Apollo, and Demeter campers, plus Percy, the only Poseidon camper. Clarisse got a map and started to assign positions. Percy noticed that it was random and did not make use of the campers' powers.\n\n \n\nClarisse explained, \"Chiron told us it's unfair to use powers since not everyone has them.\"\n\n \n\nPercy guessed that Chiron meant the Athena cabin. \"We all need to use our powers. Camp is supposed to prepare us to survive monsters, not to flatter the egos of the Athena campers. Demigods who have powers should use them, so we are have full control over them and can use our powers to protect ourselves from monsters.\"\n\n \n\nShe turned to the Demeter campers. \"How many of you can control plants?\"\n\n \n\nAll of them--Katie, Miranda, Billie, Steve, and Douglas--confirmed that they could.\n\n \n\nPercy asked, \"Who has geokinesis?\"\n\n \n\nMiranda replied, \"I do, but I can only do it when I'm extremely angry.\"\n\n \n\nPercy then asked the Ares campers, \"Who is the best at infuriating people?\"\n\n \n\nSherman Yang proudly raised his hand with a mischievous smirk. Percy asked if he would be willing to infuriate Miranda until she figured out how to access her earth powers. Sherman was all too glad to do so, moving next to Miranda, who gave him a look of annoyance.\n\n \n\nPercy then asked the Aphrodite campers,\n\n \n\n\"Who has charmspeak?\"\n\n \n\nOnly Drew and Silena raised their hands.\n\n \n\nShe continued,\n\n \n\n\"Who has amokinesis?\"\n\n \n\nAll of the Aphrodite children raised their hands.\n\n \n\nPercy asked, \"Who has active amokinesis as opposed to sensory?\"\n\n \n\nDrew, Silena, Mitchell, Valentina, Lacy, and three more girls raised their hands.\n\n \n\nPercy looked at the ones with sensory amokinesis.\n\n \n\n\"Do you have any ins with the opposing cabins?\"\n\n \n\nAll of them replied yes, a couple of them even looked vaguely insulted that she would even ask. Percy shot them apologetic looks before continuing.\n\n \n\nPercy told them, \"We need to prepare the battlefield before the battle by sowing discord among the other cabins. Sensory amokinesis is the best power for this.\"\n\n \n\nThe Aphrodite campers smirked, agreeing to start approaching the opposing campers and getting them in conflict with one another. Lacy pointed out that it would be very easy.\n\n \n\n\"Annabeth Chase, the head strategist who tends to use dirty methods and sacrifice plays, is very spoiled by both Chiron and Luke Castellan and gets on everyone's nerves. She's too proud and far too used to getting her way. Several of Luke's siblings are resentful that he cares more for her than for his own brothers and sisters. Julia Feingold, a daughter of Hermes, is especially resentful. I'm on good terms with Julia.\"\n\n \n\nPercy told her, \"Go ahead and prime Julia against Annabeth. Remove the head of the snake, and the body thrashes about uselessly. Athena's children are egotists, they like to the at the centre of the web, holding all the threads.\"\n\n \n\nWith their new strategy in place, the campers felt a renewed sense of determination. They were ready to face the challenge of Capture the Flag, united and prepared to use their unique abilities to their advantage.\n\nI got the idea of Percy regularly sacrificing to Nike and Tyche from the amazing author IWantColouredRain. You can find their wonderful story, inspired by this one, in the links.\n\nYes, Percy is discussing SA in front of her eight year old son, but keep in mind that she is using the term assaulted, which can have many meanings and the one she means will fly over Will's head but the Aphrodite campers will understand what she means.\n\nA flag is captured and a hellhound is summoned.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nPercy stood at the edge of the forest, her heart pounding with anticipation. Today was her first Capture the Flag game at Camp Half-Blood, and she was determined to make her mark. She was part of Team Red, which included the Ares, Apollo, Aphrodite, Demeter, and Poseidon cabins. However, the Poseidon cabin was just Percy herself. Because her divine father had sworn a sacred oath on the Styx not to have anymore demigod children and then had gone and had her anyway. At least he had gone to the Styx to drink from the waters and spare Percy the wrath of the goddess of hate.\n\nContrary to Chiron's suggestions, Team Red had decided to use their powers during the game. Percy had argued that not using their powers went against the camp's purpose: to train demigods to survive. Where were they supposed to learn how to access and control their powers if not at camp? Capture the Flag was the perfect situation to practice. It simulated real warfare and it was a high stress situation. Just like it would be during a monster attack outside the camp. The Team Red members looked at each other and shrugged, her words making sense to them. They had powers, they should use them. Having perfect control could save their life one day.\n\n \n\nOne day prior to the game, Percy had sent several Aphrodite campers with sensory powers to sow discord in Team Blue, which consisted of the Athena, Hermes, Hephaestus, and Dionysus cabins. The apple of discord was Annabeth Chase, Chiron's favorite student, whom he spoiled and coddled, much to the ire of the other campers. Luke Castellan also spoiled Annabeth, causing resentment among his Hermes siblings. Especially Luke's sisters felt that the head councilor was not brotherly enough toward them. It made perfect fodder to foment discord. No one liked being ignore and having what they thought as their due given to another. Percy fielded a few questions from the rest of her team about compromising enemies and how their powers could be applied to it. Sherman in particular was very interested. One of the Aphrodite boys drew him aside so they could whisper.\n\n \n\nLacy from the Aphrodite cabin had spoken to Julia Feingold from the Hermes cabin. In the last game, Julia had suffered a broken arm due to Annabeth's sacrifice play strategy, which left Julia vulnerable to attack by an angry Ares camper while Annabeth reaped the glory without a single apology to Julia. Julia had tried to complain to both Chiron and Luke, but her concerns were dismissed and brushed aside since the Apollo healers had fixed Julia's arm within the hour and ambrosia had restored her to health. She had been furious to have her injury and pain so disregarded. Lacy had increased Julia's resentment with well chosen words, tailored to appeal to Julia's hurt feelings, and her siblings had done the same with other campers.\n\n \n\nJust before the game, Percy took Drew aside. She had noticed that Annabeth and Drew often argued and belittled each other. Drew was very conventionally feminine and Annabeth thought that made Drew weak and useless. Drew, who had charmspeak powerful enough that even Smilax would be proud off.\n\n \n\nPercy handed Drew three very small salt crystals, which would allow Percy to detect someone even if they were invisible. Drew quickly understood that this was to counteract Annabeth's cap of invisibility, a trick Percy had learned in her life as Hyacinthus. It had been one of Crocus' favorite tricks. He had learned from one of his older brothers, who had a cousin who was a son of Hermes and thus had sticky fingers. Crocus had used it when they pursued bandits, to play pranks on people he did not like, or just to be able to easily find his most valued belongings in a messy chest. It was no wonder Hermes had fallen so deeply for Crocus. Percy's brother had been quite clever and resourceful.\n\n \n\nDrew took the salt crystals and went to mock Annabeth's unkempt hair, even patting it mockingly. Annabeth bristled, slapped Drew's hands away from her head and did not notice Drew placing the salt crystals. Percy smiled at Drew's perfect maneuver, the Athenian girl none the wiser. Sometimes it paid to act deliberately stereotypical and feed into people's preconceived notions. The campers underestimated the Children of Aphrodite so much. It was only fair that their disdain and prejudice should cost them the game.\n\n \n\nPercy and Miranda from the Demeter cabin were tasked with preventing Team Blue from crossing the creek and stealing the Red Team flag. Percy controlled water, while Miranda controlled earth. Sherman Yang from the Ares cabin needed to stay near Miranda, as she had issues accessing her powers regularly. The trigger for Miranda's geokinesis was rage, and Sherman had the power to induce rage. Sherman's brother Mark would help protect Miranda while she focused on her power. Kayla Knowles from the Apollo cabin would cover them from long range.\n\n \n\nPercy would be joined by Elis Wakefield from the Ares cabin, who had telumkinesis, the ability to control weapons. However, it did not work with high-grade magical weapons like Percy's sword, Riptide. Michael from the Apollo cabin was also with them. Miranda's siblings, Katie, Billie, Steve, and Douglas, who controlled plant growth, were scattered near the creek, hidden to trip up the opposing team. The rest of the Apollo cabin was in the trees, ready to snipe with paralytic arrows. Lee had prepared the herbal mixture that would disable anyone hit from a a few minutes to the quarter of an hour, depending on their constitution. It was a versatile recipe apparently and it could be made as weak or strong as needed. Percy made a mental note not to get on Lee's bad side, if the caring head councilor even had a bad side.\n\n \n\nLee Fletcher and Will Solace, who had lumokinesis, along with Clarisse La Rue and Austin Lake, were on the team tasked with stealing the opposing team's flag. Percy felt uneasy about having her son, Will, out of her sight when there would be children of Athena prowling about, but Lee and Clarisse reassured her that they would protect him. Percy decided to trust Will's brother and Clarisse, who was quite fond of little Will. As much as she wanted to, she could not just chain her child to her. Will was a growing boy and needed at least a bit of freedom. Lee had also helped Michael take care of Will for a long time. Much, much longer than Percy had.\n\n \n\nAs the game began, Percy felt a surge of confidence. She knew that with her team's powers and strategies, they had a good chance of winning. She took a deep breath and stepped forward, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\n \n\nBefore the game officially started, Percy helped Will put on his armor, double-checking that his weapons were in perfect shape and that he had enough arrows. Delighted with her adorable child, Percy kissed both his cheeks and his forehead, ruffling his curly golden hair and hugging him. Her precious, treasured sunbeam. She loved him so much. Just like she did about a hundred times per day, she mentally thanked Zagreus for giving him back to her.\n\n \n\n\"Mom, I'm ready!\" Will said, beaming up at her, his green eyes shining with infectious joy.\n\n \n\nPercy smiled warmly. \"I know you are, Will, my darling. Just remember to stay close to Lee and Clarisse, okay? Don't leave their sides for a second!\"\n\n \n\nShe grinned wider to mask her unease about having him out of her sight as she kissed his forehead again. Besides, she arguably would be in the most difficult part of the game.\n\n \n\nWill nodded eagerly. \"I will, Mom. I promise.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled at him and delivered her son right in Lee's and Clarisse's care.\n\n \n\nSeveral Athena campers shot looks of anger and envy at the affectionate display. Percy paid them no mind; she was not going to deprive her son of love and care just to spare the feelings of the Athena Cabin. She swallowed therage that their gray eyes never failed to raise. She had to keep her mind clear for the game. By winning the game she could hit them where it hurt them the most. Their prides.\n\n \n\n\"Good luck, everyone,\" Percy called out to her team. \"Let's show them what we're made of!\"\n\n \n\nThe game started, and Percy controlled the water from the creek and the lake. The Demeter kids caught a lot of the opposing team in their plant snares, and the Apollo archers winnowed them even further. However, enough managed to get near the creek. Percy and Miranda used their powers to take out as many as possible without maiming, which proved difficult. Fine control was much harder than brute force. Amyclas had once told Hyacinthus that power without control is just disaster. Some of the opposing team were very reckless, as if desperate to get that victory, which Percy found deeply strange. Why did just a game matter so much to them?\n\n \n\nShe sensed the three crystals that she had given to Drew approaching her. Percy drew her sword and attacked where she felt the crystals. She also noticed the scuff marks on the ground indicating the movements of someone invisible. Percy's sword was met by a another blade, a dagger by the feel of it. Percy attacked again, sweeping her leg toward the scuffs in the ground. She willed a surge of water, aiming for where she felt the crystals, which knocked the invisibility cap off, revealing a livid and sputtering blonde.\n\n \n\n\"Annabeth,\" Percy said with a smirk. \"Nice try.\"\n\n \n\nAnnabeth glared at her, face red. \"This isn't over, Jackson.\"\n\n \n\nPercy willed more water to sweep Annabeth into the creek and then made the entire creek too turbulent to walk or swim on. Every time the Athena girl tried to stand she fell down on her butt into the frothing, swirling waters. Luke Castellan ran toward Percy but was met by Elis, and the two boys got locked into a struggle. Percy refocused on shoving water at the opposing team. She saw Julia Feingold, the fastest camper, just leaning against a tree, doing nothing even as Annabeth screamed at her to run for the flag. Julia looked at the blonde girl, sneered, and gave her the middle fingered salute with both hands. Lacy was good, very good. Just a few conversations had ensured that the fastest runner would sit out of the game.\n\n \n\nPercy heard the trumpets and in the distance, she saw the blue flag turn gold with a lyre in the middle. Either Lee or Wil had captured the flag. Percy smiled proudly as her teammates cheered, Elis, Sherman, and Mark the loudest among them. Miranda stood proud around furrowed earth. Miranda gave a fist bump to Sherman, who hugged the older girl, lifting her up in glee and easily twirling her, his immense strength making it easy.\n\n \n\n\"We did it!\" Sherman exclaimed.\n\n \n\n\"Great job, everyone,\" Percy said, beaming. \"We showed them what we're made of.\"\n\n \n\nMiranda grinned. \"Couldn't have done it without you, Percy.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, returning Miranda's grin, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment, even if it was just a game with low stakes.\n\n \n\n\"Sherman as the one that helped you unlock your geokinesis.\"\n\n \n\nSherman whooped in joy, a proud look on his face, hugging Miranda again. He darted towards Percy, as if meaning to hug her too but he froze in exaggerated terror, looking at the sun overhead and then skedaddling away from her, making Percy snort in amusement. Apollo's sunlight on her skin felt very smug. Percy was sure he was laughing in the sun chariot.\n\n \n\nSherman then caught sight of Annabeth in the creek, unable to get out due to Percy's casual water control. Smirking, he walked over to taunt her.\n\n \n\n\"Well, well, well, look who we have here,\" Sherman said, his voice dripping with mockery.\n\n \n\n\"The great Annabeth Chase, stuck in a creek. You know, Athena demigods really have no powers. You're no match for us Ares kids in an all-out fight.\"\n\n \n\nAnnabeth glared at him, her eyes blazing with fury. \"Shut up, Sherman. This isn't over.\"\n\n \n\nSherman laughed and pointed at the golden flag moving closer.\n\n \n\n\"Oh, I think it is. I would say better luck next time, Chase but next time that flag will be red and have a spearhead in it.\"Percy watched the exchange with a mixture of amusement and unease. She had a bad feeling about something. She felt as if she was being hunted for sport. Someone or something was watching her. Percy looked around, trying to find what was giving her this feeling.\n\n \n\nAngry with Sherman, Annabeth decided to target Percy. She called out,\n\n \n\n\"Hey, Jackson! Did you know this creek was supposed to be called Zephyrus Creek until Apollo found out and went ballistic?\"\n\n \n\nPercy's mood plummeted. A horrible memory flashed in her mind. Hyacinthus desperately trying to get away from that monster. The shrieks of beloved pet swans ringing in his ears. Percy repressed a flinch, not wanting to give Athena's daughter the satisfaction of seeing her afraid. Miranda stepped in, her voice cold and her expression stormy.\n\n \n\n\"Annabeth, you're a piece of work to mention the murderer in front of the victim!\"\n\n \n\nSuddenly, Percy caught the distinctive growl of a hellhound. Nicodemos had one as a pet. Icarus had met it a few times. But this was not a tame hellhound, acting like a puppy under the command of a son of Hades. This was a monster bent on her destruction. Percy would not fall to a mere hellhound.\n\n \n\nShe immediately swung Riptide, jumping to her side. The campers screamed at the sight of a monster right in the middle of camp. Percy released her hold on the creek, which enabled Annabeth to escape. Percy used the water to put the hellhound in a water sphere, immobilizing it. Something she saw Crocus once do. Then she stabbed the hellhound deep in the neck with Riptide. The hellhound dissolved into golden dust.\n\n \n\nWill screamed for Percy and started running toward her, crying. He threw himself at Percy in a flying tackle. Percy caught him, and Will started to cry into her chest. The sun got hotter in response to Apollo's rage. Chiron arrived, and multiple campers yelled about the hellhound. Apollo materialized and hurried to Percy and Will.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, are you okay?\" Apollo asked, his voice filled with concern. He was in his younger form, the same apparent age as Percy and his eyes blazed molten gold. Percy could almost pity whoever summoned that hellhound. When Apollo found them there would be Tartarus to pay.\n\n \n\n\"I'm fine,\" Percy replied, holding a still crying Will close. \"Just a bit shaken.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's eyes blazed with anger when he saw Chiron. \"Who let a hellhound into camp? What kind of insanity are you running here?\"\n\n \n\nChiron stepped forward, his expression grave.\n\n \n\n\"We'll find out, Lord Apollo. For now, let's make sure everyone is safe.\"Apollo glared at the centaur but nodded and moved closer to Percy and Will, gently ushering them out of the forest. The rest of the campers followed suit. Many of them eyeing the god with acute fear. Especially the Hermes cabin. What had happened there? A couple of the Hermes dwellers shoot uneasy looks at Will. Percy's son noticed and seemed to withdraw in himself as he moved closer to her.\n\n \n\nPercy looked around at her friends and teammates, feeling a mix of relief and determination. She knew that they had won the game, but she had a creeping feeling that the real battle was just beginning. There was something in Apollo's expression. She had seen it before. A deep, cold rage. What had happened in Olympus?\n\nShorter than usual. I have been having the worst day. My grandma, who is already on end-of-life care, just got diagnosed with endometrial cancer. The doctors say that she is too weak to endure any type of treatment, she will just be on palliative care for as long as she holds on.\n\nZeus is a bastard and an idiot.\n\nPercy has to be the voice of reason.\n\nPercy Jackson wiped the sweat from her brow, her sword still gleaming with the dark blood of the hellhound she had just slain. The Red Team's victory in Capture the Flag was overshadowed by the unexpected attack. Apollo's face was a mask of cold fury as he led Percy, their son Will, and Chiron to the Big House. By the way his eyes gleamed golden, it was not just the hellhound attack. Percy almost pitied whoever summoned that hellhound. Apollo would definitely punish the culprit harshly. Michael had told her what Apollo had done a camper who had tried to kill Will over a year ago. Percy had asked after she had notice the unease some campers had around her precious, adorable son. It had been terrifying how she had almost lost her son again, before she could even met him.\n\n \n\nInside, Poseidon stood with his trident in hand, looking furious, Percy reached her senses to the sea. The surface was deadly still but the depths were swirling and cold with icy rage. She really hoped sealife would not be negatively impacted. Artemis was beside him, her expression unreadable. Icarus had seen Artemis look like this before she unleashed divine punishments upon those who had offended her. Dionysus lounged in an armchair, looking displeased, while Ariadne held his hand, offering a warm smile to Percy and Will as they entered.\n\n \n\n\"Sit down,\" Apollo commanded, his voice tight with anger, his eyes blazing like miniature suns. It was not just the hellhound. Apollo had already been angry when the attack had happened.\n\n \n\nPercy and Will took their seats, exchanging worried glances. Apollo took a deep breath before speaking.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus has seen it fit to issue an ultimatum. He still thinks that Poseidon is the culprit even though Poseidon swore on the Styx that he did not steal the bolt and both Hermes and I confirmed that he was telling the truth.\" he began.\n\"Percy, Will, you are ordered by divine decree to find and return Zeus's missing bolt by the Summer Solstice, or there will be war. Zeus plans to start by killing both of you.\"\n\n \n\nPercy felt a surge of anger. \"Will is only eight years old!\" she protested.\n\n \n\nWill looked up at her, beautiful green his eyes wide.\n\n \n\n\"I'll be nine on July 7,\" he said quietly.\n\n \n\n\"That's beside the point,\" Percy snapped. \"It's unjust and unfair to make such a small child go on a quest.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon stepped forward, his trident gleaming.\n\n \n\n\"We could just go to war,\" he suggested, his voice cold and his eyes like swirling green hurricanes.\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head. A divine war would devastate the planet. She cared, even if the gods did not. Besides, it was the thief would want.\n\n \n\n\"Someone stole Zeus's bolt for a reason, to spark a war. We can't play right into that party's hands. Likely they plan to strike while everyone is locked into a fight and catch Olympus unaware.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis nodded in agreement.\n\n \n\n\"Percy's right. We need to find out who is behind this and stop them.\"\n\n \n\nDionysus sighed, looking even more displeased.\n\n \n\n\"This is going to be a long summer,\" he muttered.\n\n \n\nAriadne squeezed his hand, her smile never wavering.\n\n \n\n\"We'll get through this together,\" she said softly.\n\n \n\nPercy looked at her son, determination in her eyes. As much as she wanted to keep him away from this horrible quest, Zeus would not take defiance of his direct orders well. If Percy left her son behind in the safety of the camp, Zeus would likely wipe the camp of the map. He had done such before, vaporized entire cities who had defied his divine decrees. The barrier that protected the camp was a creation of Zeus after all.\n\n \n\n\"We'll find the bolt, Will. And we'll do it together.\"\n\n \n\nWill nodded, his small hand gripping hers tightly. He looked uncertain but she saw no fear in him. He was too young to truly know what fear was. Percy' heart ached as she recalled how fearless and curious Alexios had been. She would not allow it to happen again. She would keep her son close, no matter what it took.\n\n \n\n\"Together,\" he echoed.\n\n \n\nChiron chose to speak, his voice calm and measured.\n\n \n\n\"The obvious culprit is Hades. The god of the underworld is bitter and resentful at how he is kept at arm's length and only allowed to visit Olympus one day a year, the Winter Solstice.\"\n\n \n\nPercy raised an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n\"Chiron, have you lost your marbles? Or watching Disney Hercules too much? I've been a denizen of Hades for the three thousand years I was dead as Icarus in Elysium. Every time there was a big war, we found out because his majesty the dark king would bellow and howl in outrage about the incoming paperwork, which he hates with a passion. More than he hates Zeus I assure you. The whole underworld would shake with his rage.\"\n\n \n\nChiron nodded thoughtfully, looking a tad embarrassed to have jumped on the blame Hades bandwagon. Percy wondered if Chiron was projecting. Chiron was half-brother to the Elder Olympians, having the same father as them. But Chiron had never been and would never be on the same level as the other children of Kronos.\n\n \n\n\"True, but Hades did send a Fury after you and also the Minotaur, thinking you had the bolt.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon snorted, looking nostalgic and vaguely amused.\n\"No one knows what my older brother thinks. He delights in being mysterious and keeps his secrets far to close to his chest. The only person that can convince him to part with his secrets is his queen, but Demeter will not hear of letting Persephone go back early. I already asked and she almost skewered me with her sickle.\"\n\n \n\n\"Then someone needs to go and ask Hades.\" Percy told the gods and centaur.\n\n \n\nArtemis nodded in agreement.\n\n \n\n\"Percy's right. We need to find out who is behind this and stop them. Poseidon is also right, it is highly unlikely that it is Hades.\"\n\n \n\nDionysus held up a hand.\n\n \n\n\"Even if Hades is not the thief he is still behaving in a suspicious manner. He might believe that Percy is the thief. Percy was reincarnated against his wishes.\"\n\n \n\nPercy crossed her arms.\n\n \n\n\"Hades was the one to judge Hyacinthus and Icarus and he put them both in Elysium. Hades knows that I'm not a thief.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon nodded in agreement.\n\n \n\n\"Hades is not a thief and neither does he want a war.\"\n\n \n\nApollo frowned. \"Then what could be making Hades behave like this?\"\n\n \n\nArtemis spoke up, her voice calm.\n\n \n\n\"Hades might just want leverage due to the prophecy. Also, Apollo, Ares, Athena and I searched every corner of the earth for the bolt. Apollo and Hermes know that Poseidon is telling the truth that he did not steal the bolt, so it is not in the seas. That leaves the Underworld as the obvious place to hide it. Gods can't go there without permission, which is next to impossible to get since Hermes' blunder with Zagreus.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, as her fuzzy memories of the Underworld became slightly clearer. Elysium kept everyone in a state of happiness and contentment, making it incredibly difficult to focus on what was happening outside. But Icarus had missed Apollo dreadfully and acutely, reducing the effect somewhat. Occasionally he was able to hear things from the outside and even walk to the gates to watch the rest of the Underworld.\n\n \n\n\"After the banishment from Olympus, Hades tightened the security of the Underworld. No god without underworld domains can get inside without permission. I remember the arguments he had with the rest of the underworld gods. Hades decided if you wanted to keep him out of Olympus, then he would keep you out of his kingdom.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon, Apollo and Artemis looked at one another. Percy could not quite decipher what they felt about Hades keeping them out of his kingdom. She knew that Apollo would not feel one bit sorry about Hades' banishment. Her beloved blamed Hades for keeping Hyacinthus soul and for putting Icarus' reincarnation on hold. She doubted Apollo would ever forgive their uncle.\n\n \n\n\"But demigods can go into the Underworld,\" Percy pointed out.\n\n \n\n\"I can go to look for Zeus's bolt.\"\n\n \n\nApollo cleared his throat, drawing their attention back to him.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, you will need a prophecy. You must consult the Oracle of Delphi.\"\n\n \n\nPercy frowned.\n\n \n\n\"I've noticed that camp is called Delphi Strawberry Fields, but I haven't seen any dwellings fit for the honored Pythia. Even the big house is not dignified or grand enough.\"\n\n \n\nAll the gods grimaced at her words.Chiron looked away. Percy looked around, puzzled.\n\n \n\n\"Why are you all making such faces about the Oracle of Delphi?\"\n\n \n\nApollo sighed.\n\n \n\n\"After WWII, someone cursed the Oracle, and the spirit was trapped in the corpse of Della, the oracle of the time. We tried to have the Pythia's spirit pass to a different vessel, but it did not work. The oracle candidates just went insane. The last attempt was about eighteen years ago.\"\n\n \n\nChiron nodded.\n\n \n\n\"The one who tried it last was the mother of Luke Castellan, a lover of Hermes.\"\nPercy looked shocked. She had spoked to Luke a few times, but Luke had not mentioned being an essence baby like Will. Given how much Annabeth Chase liked to brag about her close relationship with Luke, the girl would have mentioned if Luke was created in a manner similar to to Annabeth. Besides, Hyacinthus had known Hermes as the lover of Crocus. Crocus had liked to overshare. If Hermes was in the habit of making essence or mind babies instead of making them the fun way, Percy would eat olives with every meal for a week.\n\n \n\n\"Why was a mother allowed to even try housing the Oracle? Unless I'm really recalling ancient times wrong, the Oracle of Delphi was always a maiden.\"\n\n \n\nApollo sighed, looking weary.\n\n \n\n\"It's not absolutely necessary for the Oracle to be a maiden,\" he explained. \"I made that a rule because my grandmother Phoebe and I noticed that every time the Oracle fell pregnant, the Pythian energies corrupted and altered the fetus.\"\n\n \n\nApollo had taught the art of prophecy to both Hyacinthus and Icarus, but it was the first time Percy was hearing this. She had all her past memories and something like this would have stuck in her mind. Apollo continued.\n\"The pregnant Pythias gave birth to abominations. At times, it was snake-like monsters. Far too many of the drakons that plague the world were born to the Pythias of ancient past. At times, it was a hybrid of human and snake. Sometimes, it was mostly humanoid with scales and poisonous fangs. A few times, it was a perfectly normal-looking baby who grew up with an appetite for human flesh.\"\n\n \n\nApollo stared into the distance, as if recalling each and single case. Percy was certain he did.\n\n \n\n\" It was a fresh new horror almost every time. I decided that only sworn eternal maidens could become the Oracle to prevent the birth of such abominations.\"\n\n \n\nPercy shuddered at the thought. \"Then we have to find a way to break the curse and restore the Oracle after the bolt mess is finished.\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded. \"Yes, and time is of the essence about the bolt. We must act quickly.\"\n\n \n\nPercy stood, determination in her eyes. \"We have to find the bolt, so we, consult the Oracle, and prevent this war. We have to.\"\n\n \n\nThey climbed four flights of stairs, ending under a green trapdoor. Apollo pulled the cord, and a wooden ladder fell down. They climbed up into the attic, the air thick with the scent of old rotted wood, dust, mildew and snakes. Percy noticed Apollo tense at the smell. She reached for his hand, silently offering comfort. In her first life after she had killed a drakon approaching Sparta, Apollo had told her about how his battle with the Python had truly went. It had not been the easy fight that bards sang of. Apollo had been only four days old, the Python almost as old as Gaea.\n\n \n\n\"Are you ready?\" Apollo asked, his eyes filled with concern as he fought down his unease.\n\n \n\nPercy took a deep breath and nodded. \"I'm ready.\"\n\n \n\nThe attic was full of typical hero trophies. Percy spied armour stands covered in cobwebs, meaning that spiders prowled. She almost smiled as she recalled Daedalus shrieking whenever he saw spiders. From a young age Icarus had been his dad's official spider killer.\n\n \n\nShe distracted by old leather steamer trunks plastered with stickers saying Ithaca, Circe's Isle and Land of the Amazons. A long table was full of glass jars filled with formaldehyde preserved monster parts. Mounted on the wall was a hydra head.\n\n \n\nBy the window, sitting on a traditional wooden tripod stool stood a mummified female body. She wore a tie-dyed sundress, lots of beaded necklaces and a headband to cover long black hair. The skin of her face was stretched over her skull grotesquely, her eyes were fogged white slits. Percy could definitely believe that the Pythia had been dead for more than half a century. She could not help but feel both pity for the girl who was reduced to this and indignation that such a respected figure in Hyacinthus and Icarus times was now this.\n\n \n\nAs Icarus, Percy had never met the Pythia. He had lived in Crete, only leaving the day he died. Hyacinthus had spend time in Delphi, taken there by Apollo for their couple vacation. Percy shivered as she recalled how horribly that vacation had ended. Hyacinthus only saw the Pythia in passing, not having any questions for her. The Pythia had been a dignified and regal woman in her forties. Percy recalled her looking at Hyacinthus with deep pity. Had she known?\n\n \n\nDella's mummified corpse sat up on her tripod and opened her macabre mouth. A green mist poured from hr mouth, spreading over the floor in thick, writhing tendrils, hissing like a sea of snakes.\n\n \n\n\"I am the spirit of Delphi, speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo, the slayer of the mighty Python. Approach, the sun's third beloved, and ask.\"\n\n \n\nPercy took a step closer to the Oracle, took a deep breath and asked,\n\n \n\n\"How can if find the bolt and stop the war?\"\n\n \n\nThe mist swirled, shifting and taking shape in front of Percy. She was displeased to see her five elder brothers and first stepmother from her first life. Argalus, Cynortas, Harpalus, and Diomede's green mist copies stood in front of Percy, eyeing her with that familiar hate and resentment. Percy heard Apollo's snarl of rage somewhere behind her. He had hated Hyacinthus' half-brothers even more than Hyacinthus himself had.\n\n \n\nMist Argalus turned toward percy and spoke in the hissing, sibilant voice of the Pythia,\n\n \n\nYou shall go west, and face the god who has turned\n\n \n\nArgalus turned to Cynortas,\n\n \n\nYou shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned\n\n \n\nHarpalus then spoke with a gleeful smirk.\n\n \n\nYou shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend\n\n \n\nTypical, even a mist copy of Harpalus would be a resentful little turd.\nThen Diomede spoke, her eyes cold and a hateful sneer upon her face\n\n \n\nAnd you shall fail to save what matters to you most, in the end\n\n \n\nPercy felt the warmth of Apollo's radiating rage as she watched the figures dispate and the mist coalesce into a large green serpent, which went back into the mummified Pythia. The corpse went back to sit upon her sacre tripod, looking as if she had never moved. Percy turned to Apollo. They looked at each other and descended down the ladder and then down the stairs.\n\n \n\n\"Did you receive a prophecy?\" Chiron asked once Percy and Apollo were back in the living room. The gods did not ask, but then again they propably already heard the prophecy.\n\n \n\n\"You will need a third person to take with you.\" Chiron told her.\n\n \n\nPercy just looked at him.\n\n \n\n\"I have a suggestion,\" The centaur continued but Dionysus stood up.\n\n \n\n\"That Anniebell girl?\" The god of wine and madness spoke.\n\n \n\n\"Absolutey not!\" Percy told them both. Dionysus raised an eyebrow, shotting a look at Ariadne who looked very, very neutral. Ariadne had been the one to help Icarus wash Alexios' body and wrap him in the funeral linens. Ariadne detested children of Athena nearly as much as Percy did. Chiron shot Percy a look of disapointment.\n\n \n\n\"I know that you are rather hostile to the Athena Cabin, but Annabeth volunteered and she has prepared long for a quest.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon turned to look at Chiron with tightlipped annoyance. Ariadne's fingers tightened around her husband's hand. Dionysus winced a bit.\n\n \n\n\"I will not be taking a child of hers, dad. Don't worry.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon nodded at Percy, his annoyance replaced with a look of paternal pride that she had seen in Amyclas and Daedalus before.\n\n \n\n\"Who are you taking then?\" Artemis inquired.\n\n \n\nPercy turned to her second life's maternal figure.\n\n \n\n\"I will ask Lee Fletcher. He is a councilor, almost sixteen years old, excellent archer, competent with a sword too.\"\n\n \n\nPercy then turned to Chiron.\n\n \n\n\"Lee also has several powers, healing, lumokinessis and sound manipulation. A much better choice than someone without a single power to depend on.\"\n\n \n\nApollo nodded in approval.\n\n \n\n\"Lee also loves Will dearly and would never do anything to hurt him.\" Apollo spoke.\n\n \n\nPercy looked at Apollo. He was also thinking of the betrayal part.\n\n \n\nPoseidon was looking at the Riptide in hair clip form in Percy's hair.\n\n \n\n\"Did Crocus ever show you how to use a trident?\" Poseidon asked.\n\n \n\nPercy smiled, memories of messing about with Crocus' prized cyclops forged trident filling her mind.\n\n \n\n\"Oh yes, he did.\" She laughed.\n\n \n\n\"How were you with it?\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon produced a gold ring set with a blue pearl. He tapped the pearl twice and the ring transformed into a trident that he held out to Percy.\n\n \n\nPercy took the trident and signaled as Crocus had showed her millenia ago. Poseidon readied himself as Percy attacked. Her father easily deflected her blows for a few minutes before holding up his left hand. Percy stopped attacking.\n\n \n\n\"Good,\" Poseidon spoke.\n\n \n\n\"Could use more practice but decent. Inside it is hollow and filled with sacred waters from my personal saltwater spring in Atlantis. You will be able to control the trident like you control water.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon produced another ring, this one smaller and the pearl on it was golden. He motioned for Will to get closer.\n\n \n\n\"A trident for my grandson as well. This one does not contain saltwater within because you don't have control over water but it will return to you if lost.\"\n\n \n\nWill thanked his grandfather and took the ring. Percy made a mental note to try and find some time to teach him how to use it. For this unjust quest Will would have to rely on his bow and daggers.\n\n \n\n\"I will also provide you with three of my best pegasi. After the quest is over the pegasi will be added to the camp stables.\"\n\n \n\nPercy thanked her father and went to find Lee. Hopefully he would accept. If Will had not been mandated to come to this quest her second quester would have been Clarisse or Miranda. Unfortunately, the king of the gods, god of justice and fairness had decided to be a real bastard. Percy wondered if Zeus wanted Olympus to be razed. It was not a good idea to make the one that would decide if Olympus got to survive or not furious and resentful.\n\n \n\nWhat was going on Olympus, and what was Zeus thinking. If Poseidon had been the one behind the theft of the bolt, he would have had his armies ready to attack the moment Zeus was boltless and reeling from the loss. It was one of the basic rules of warfare, strike when the enemy is weak and lacking vital resources. Zeus had three war deity children, Ares, Athena and Enyo. Were they not advising him in matters of warcraft?\n\nPercy yells at Chiron. The questers run into three Furies and a Gorgon\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nPercy stood at the entrance of the Big House, the prophecy from the mummified oracle still echoing in her mind. She needed a third person for the quest. With determination, she headed towards the Apollo Cabin to ask Lee Fletcher to join her and Will.\n\n \n\nAs she walked, Annabeth Chase intercepted her.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, is it true that there going to be a quest?\" Annabeth asked, her grey eyes filled with curiosity and eagerness.\n\n \n\nPercy nodded and sighed, wanting to get away from the child of Athena as soon as possible.\n\n \n\n\"Yes, there is going to be a quest.\" She said and tried to sidestep the other camper.\n\n \n\nAnnabeth's curiosity turned to insistence.\n\n \n\n\"Who's going?\"She demandend, blocking Percy's way. While tempted to just shove her away, Percy restrained herself. She reminded herself that Annabeth was just a twelve year old and not the second coming of Alkinoos. Percy was certain that Alkinoos was still in the Fields of Punishment. Only dwellers of Elysium and very rarely, dwellers of Asphodel got the chance to be reborn.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus ordered me and Will to go on the quest. I'm going to get Lee to be the third,\" Percy replied, very annoyed.\n\n \n\nAnnabeth's face crumbled into a very mulish expression. It reminded Percy of when she attended feasts as Hyacinthus. Amyclas always asked Hyacinthus to sit at his right side as the chosen heir. Argalus made the exact same expression.\n\"Lee doesn't deserve a quest. I'm so much smarter, more strategic, and more capable than him. I've waited for years for a chance to prove myself.\" Annabeth insisted, planting herself even more firmly in Percy's path.\n\n \n\nPercy's eyes widened. She was too used to Daedalus, who had good reasons to be arrogant, but even he was not this stubborn and entitled about it. As much as Daedalus liked to pat himself in the back once in a while, he acted modest in public most of the time because he knew that being insufferable about his genius only would gain him unnecessary enemies. This girl needed a severe reality check. Percy doubtled that Chiron would give her one and Percy did not care enough to do it. She could burst the girl's bubble a little though.\n\n \n\n\"Annabeth, your supposed smarts are unproven. You've never been to school since the other day you were bragging about having lived here since seven years old, and Camp education is rather watered down. I have been to real school and I can tell you that it is quite hard compared to Camp.\"\n\n \n\n\"As for strategic. I've seen your strategies during Capture the Flag. Such strategies would have gotten you kicked out of your home polis if you lived in Ancient Greece.\"\n\"Wasting lives for nothing is never approved, especially since the bulk of the soldiers and warriors were from the citizen class and their fathers would not have tolerated having their sons used recklessly for a suicidial charge. As for you having waited a long time for a quest, I don't care. I decide who comes on the quest, and I will not be taking you.\"\n\n \n\nAnnabeth's eyes flashed with anger at being denied what she wanted.\n\n \n\n\"Without me, you'll just mess up like you did with the discus as Hyacinthus and with the wings as Icarus.\"\n\n \n\nPercy walked up to Annabeth and backhanded her across the face, with enough strength to knock Annabeth down. Chiron and Luke Castellan, who had been content just overhearing the argument, started to walk over looking alarmed.\n\n \n\nPercy glared at Annabeth. She wondered if Athena manufactured this one with some Hapsburg descendant. First she mentions Zephyrus in Percy's hearing, then she demands to be taken to a quest. And now she throws Percy's prior deaths on her face. Understandable that Icarus' death was misinterpreted by everyone but Hyacinthus' death? That was clear cut murder. The only one at fault was that creep.\n\n \n\n\"You stupid girl, you have no idea what you're talking about.\"\n\n \n\nChiron's voice was stern. \"Percy, that was uncalled for.\"\n\n \n\nOr course, he only took notice when one of his favorites got what they deserved but stayed put and said nothing when Annabeth was running her mouth.\n\n \n\nLuke added, \"Annabeth, you need to respect Percy's decision.\"\n\n \n\nPercy eyed Luke, his words seemed reasonable but his eyes were telling another story. His blue eyes were shining with anger and annoyance, much like everytime Percy knocked him down during spars. This one needed watching. Percy had a rather bad feeling about him, no matter who friendly and integrating the young man was.\n\nLuke reminded her a lot of courtiers that she had dealt with in her past lives. Everyone had been eager to flatter Hyacinthus, especially after he had been created Crown Prince of Sparta. While Icarus had not been a prince, he was the son of Minos' prized genius inventor, a great favorite of the queen and Princes Ariadne and Minos had found him tolerable enough to make him cupbearer when Icarus turned fifteen. After Apollo had stayed with both Hyacinthus and Icarus for over a year with no sign of getting bored and moving on, the opportunist eager to be friends had increased.\n\nApollo and Artemis approached, looking furious. Chiron tried to minimize the situation as it was his habit.\n\n \n\n\"Annabeth didn't mean it.\" He spoke, hoping that if Percy let it slide the two gods would. That Apollo of all gods would let it slide. As much as Percy loved him, enough that as Icarus she died for him she was not blind to his temper, wrath and vindictiveness.\n\n \n\nA few times, after having tucked Will in, Percy had thought on how mortals had perceived Icarus for the past three thousand years. She had lost track of how many art pieces were about his fall. How had Apollo felt about it she had not asked, not yet.\n\n \n\nPercy recalled the song \"Icarus\" by Bastille that explored themes of self-destruction, recklessness, and the consequences of one's actions. The lyrics vividly depicted a person on a dangerous path, heedlessly pursuing desires and ambitions without considering the potential fallout. The protagonist is warned that they're \"flying too close to the sun,\" much like the regular mortal's view of Icarus, who met his demise due to ambition and pride. The song captured the tension between living life to the fullest and the risks involved. She had always wondered why she hated that song so much.\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head just about done with Chiron and the ones he constantly coddled.\n\n \n\n\"She definitely meant it. And it's your fault, Chiron, that she's such a spoiled little brat. You've been neglecting the rest of the campers for her sake. You don't teach combat to the Aphrodite and Demeter cabins because you deem them 'weak' when they actually have very impressive powers. As demigods, they are in as much danger as anyone else and need to know how to fight and kill monsters. You were charged with teaching all demigods, not just the nasty little brats you personally like and to Tartarus with everyone else.\"\n\n \n\nChiron looked taken aback. \"Percy, that's not fair.\"\n\n \n\nPercy continued, \"Do you think the incident thousands of years ago when Crocus and his brothers, my brothers, waterboarded that camper was an isolated incident? It wasn't! It was just one of many such incidents and I got lucky that Crocus returned early. Smilax's sisters and other campers back then were not so lucky. Smilax tricked all of the Zeus cabins and half of the Ares cabin to their deaths for a very good reason. Because she wanted to keep herself and her sisters safe! But you refuse to see it even today!\"\n\n \n\nAnnabeth insisted, \"Percy, you're still going to mess up without me, just like Icarus did by flying too high, falling into the sea, and causing the Bronze Age Collapse.\"\n\n \n\nApollo and Artemis's faces twisted in rage. Percy hoped that they did not explode, it was the last thing that this situation needed.\n\n \n\nArtemis, visibly annoyed, stepped forward and looked at Annabeth, who had scrambled up and was dusting off her khakis.\n\n \n\n\"Girl, you don't know the full story. Icarus was cursed at birth to die young. Apollo tried to circumvent the Fates by making Icarus immortal so he wouldn't die. The Fates became angry and wanted to punish Apollo for his defiance by throwing him in Tartarus. However, they realized that there would be no world without the god of the sun, light, healing, reason, and logic. So they gave Icarus a choice. Either Icarus fell or Apollo did. Icarus chose to die to save both Apollo and the world.\"\n\n \n\n\"Icarus was a million times more of a hero than you will ever be. Than anyone Chiron has ever taught and cared for.\" Artemis finished, glaring at Annabeth and Chiron.\n\nThere was silence from everyone overhearing the true reason Icarus fell. Then whispers started. Percy saw a few Aphrodite children almost tear up a bit. As their mother had decreed Apollo and Icarus were peak tragic romance, and knowing the real reason made it even more tragic and romantic. Smilax had that tendency to get lost in the romantic details of something too.\n\nChiron looked at Percy as if he had never seen her before. Percy rolled her eyes. Chiron had disliked Hyacinthus for being friends with Crocus and Smilax even if he had to be quite polite due to Hyacinthus' status. Percy did not even want to know what Chiron had thought of Icarus. Likely something in the same vein as Annabeth. Mr. Brunner had seemed decent enough but when Percy had come to camp, Chiron had said that had Percy died it the way it would have wasted his time teaching her. Not that it would have been a tragedy because a twelve year old girl died, but because it woudl have wasted Chiron's precious time. As if Percy had asked him to take a sabbatical and come teach her at Yancy.\n\nPercy broke the murmuring by calling out to Lee Fletcher, who was looking stupefied.\n\n \n\n\"Lee, do you want to come on the quest with me?\"\n\n \n\nLee snapped out of his astonishment and nodded.\n\n \n\n\"Give me a bit of time to pack up my supplies.\"\n\n \n\nThe rest of the Apollo cabin were outraged.\n\n \n\n\"You're taking an eight-year-old on a dangerous quest?\" Michael shouted as Victoria and Austin nodded at his words, not having heard that it was Zeus' decree rather than Percy's decision.\n\n \n\nPercy turned to face them.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus ordered it. I won't want to bring my child to such a dangerous quest but unfortunately I don't have a choice.\"\n\nMichael turned to Victoria and wondered if they still had to sacrifice to Zeus when he was making their little brother go look for his bolt. Victoria hissed at him that they did not need him to be angrier. Michael replied that he would ensure that Zeus' piece is the smallest of the bunch for this.\n\nLee emerged from the cabin, his arms laden with supplies and a huge backpack on his back.\n\n \n\n\"Got everything we need,\" he said, his voice steady.\n\n \n\n\"Good,\" Percy replied, her eyes scanning the horizon.\n\n \n\n\"Let's head back to the Big House.\"\n\n \n\nAs they made their way back, Apollo, Artemis, and Chiron joined them. Luke Castellan followed closely behind, a mysterious box clutched in his hands.\n\n \n\nWhen they reached the living room of the Big House, they found Ariadne sitting with Will on one of the sofas. She was in the middle of recounting a story from her childhood as she gently patted his golden curls. Percy felt a wave of nostalgia as she recalled Ariadne do that with Alexios.\n\n \n\n\"...and that's when the Minotaur got loose,\" Ariadne was saying, her eyes wide with the memory. Percy shivered as she recalled that horrible day. The day that started the whole Labyrinth mess.\n\n \n\n\"He started slaughtering his way across the palace. Icarus and I were in my mother's gardens. We had just finished having our lunch and went for a digestive walk. The Minotaur charged at us, but Icarus was quick. He grabbed my red himation and used it as a lure to send the Minotaur right into one of the lotus ponds. Then he picked me up and we ran toward Daedalus's house. We barricaded ourselves inside until Daedalus got home.\"\n\n \n\nWill listened intently, his eyes wide with fascination.\n\n \n\n\"Wow, that sounds terrifying,\" he said.\n\n \n\n\"It was,\" Ariadne admitted, her voice softening. \"But Icarus was always so brave and clever. He saved us both that day.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled at the scene, feeling a sense of warmth and camaraderie. He was glad that he had been able to protect Ariadne. Dionysus was playing with a few cans but Percy had a feeling that she had heard everything Ariadne had told Will.\n\n \n\n\"We could use some of that bravery and cleverness on our quest. Hopefully I did not use it up on my previous lives,\" she said, stepping into the room.\n\n \n\nAriadne looked up and smiled. \"You'll have it, Percy. I have faith in you. I always had and I always will.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled, humbled and touched at the faith her friend still had in her even more than three thousand years later.\n\n \n\nPercy recalled that in order to enter the Underworld without offending Hades, they had to bring something of value as offerings. Apollo had that covered. He handed Will a shimmering, sunlike jewel the size of a man's fist.\n\n \n\n\"This is the petrified heart of one of Helios' sun dragons. They are very rare and very precious. I doubt Hades is in possession of one.\" Apollo explained as he nodded at Posiedon who gave a sharklike smile.\n\n \n\n\"After Poseidon dealt with Helios I took over his Sun Palace. His sun dragons were unruly so I opted to just kill them. A couple managed to escape but they were both male so there is no concern of there being more now.\"\n\n \n\nPercy received a bonsai of the Icarus tree.\n\n \n\n\"Persephone has been hankering for this for three thousand years,\" Apollo said with a smile. \"Hades has tried to buy a sapling or seed off me for nearly as long. I refused to sell to him. He will definitely want this to make his queen happy.\"\nLee was given a shiny black calyx sculpted with an image of Hades and Persephone on their thrones. Percy recognized it immediately.\n\"Icarus and Daedalus made this together in ancient Knossos. It is made in the old style which was lost after the Bronze Age Collapse.\" she said, her voice filled with wonder. \"I can't believe it survived this long.\"\n\nApollo nodded. \"These offerings will ensure safe passage into the Underworld.\"\n\n \n\nApollo turned to Percy.\n\n \n\n\"I preserved all of Icarus' belongings, just like Clio preserved all of Hyacinthus' belongings,\" he said.\n\n \n\nPercy looked at him, surprised. \"Really?\"\nShe knew that they had missed Hyacinthus and Icarus but had no idea that they would go this far.\n\n \n\nApollo nodded. \"One of the items confiscated and preserved by Clio is the Crown of Lelex.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's eyes widened with recognition. \"The Crown of Lelex is how the Spartan kingship is passed on. If Clio took it after Hyacinthus died, then the kings that came after Amyclas were not fully ratified.\"\n\n \n\nApollo smiled. \"Exactly. The crown is still rightfully yours even if you no longer have Lelex' bloodline. Asclepius however is of Lelex' bloodline.\"\nPercy understood the implications. Once this quest was over she would be able to meet her first mother and her firstborn son. Clio had the crown and Asclepius had the blood.\n\n \n\nThe three pegasi that Poseidon had promised descended from the sky into the lawn of the big house. All three were white as seafoam, gorgeously beautiful and saddled. The saddles even had saddlebags which upon a quick check proved to contain non perishable food and bottled water. Percy spied cans of several types of fish and seafood, hardtack, packets of dry biscuits, jerky and canned fruit.\n\n \n\nChiron eyed the horses, who eyed him right back.\n\n \n\n\"Percy has not had any horseriding lessons yet.\" He pointed out.\n\"Let alone pegasi riding lessons.\"\n\n \n\n\"Not in this lifetime.\" Snorted Artemis, who had taught Icarus how to ride a horse. As a grandson of Poseidon Icarus had been a natural.\n\n \n\n\"I know how to handle horses Chiron.\" Percy told him as she introduced herself to the horses.\nThe largest and leader of them was a male named Marble. He was insisting to the smaller male named Foam and the female named Cream that he should be the one to carry the Lord's daughter. Percy smiled as she petted the pegasus.\n\n \n\n\"Which one of you is the steadiest and safest flier?\" She asked the pegasi who looked at each other before replying.\n\"Definitely Cream.\" Marble admitted with some surliness.\n\"Good, Cream gets to carry someone more important than me. My son Will.\"\n\n \n\nCream came closer to Percy and sniffed her.\n\n \n\n\"Lady is too young to have a foal!\" She asked, incredulity in her tone. When Ariadne had gotten her first period at thirteen she had been at Daedalus mansion attending lessons. Ariadne had freaked out and so had Icarus. Daedalus had been too patriarchal to help. He had just sent them to the queen. Pasiphae had explained to them both as she fed her daughter a tea for the discomfort. Percy had received that talk from her mother already, but it had not happened yet.\n\n \n\nPoseidon made a grumbling sound reminiscent of a tidal wave crashing upon the shore.\n\n \n\n\"I am,\" Percy replied to Cream. \"But essence babies work in mysterious ways. Will is still my foal.\"\n\n \n\n\"I am very honoured to carry your foal my lady,\" Cream spoke and Percy gestured Will to come closer.\n\n \n\n\"Percy? Why are you talking to the pegasi?\" Lee asked as Foam mored closer to him.\n\n \n\n\"All my children can talk to horses, pegasy and other similar creatures like zebras.\" Poseidon replied.\n\n \n\nThe sea god looked at Will who was patting Cream. The little boy seemed disappointed not to be able to understand her.\n\n \n\n\"Very few of my grandchildren can. The only one with the ability that I can recall now is Hippolytus. But Hippolytus did not have Will's gifts at sea.\" Poseidon grimaced as Artemis glared ferociusly at him. Percy recalled hearing an audiobook of that tale as part of Mr. Brunner's class. Poseidon definitely should have double checked before enabling Theseus' filicide.\n\n \n\nPercy focused on introducing Will to Cream. She did not want to think about what had happened to her nephew via Theseus. That poor boy. She knew from ther life as Hyacinthus was it was like to have a stepmother with unsavoury intentions. Hyacinthus had definitely preferred Diomede to Aristodamia. Better to have a stepmother try and kill him than one who would try and get in his chiton.\n\n \n\nStill, Hyacinthus had been sure that if he had gone to Amyclas, Amyclas would have believed his own son. Why had Theseus believed Phaedra over his own child? Phaedra had not been the most pleasant of children. Minos' verbal abuse ensured that the little girl would grow up hurting but Icarus would not have thought that Phaedra would end up harassing her stepson. The play that Percy had heard cast the blame at Aphrodite's feet.\n\n \n\nApollo approached her, making Percy shake her thoughts on long dead people. Apollo placed a golden ring on her left hand, the fourth finger. Percy looked at it. It had a sun design and with a yellow stone in the middle, a diamont given the sparkle. As Hyacinthus and Icarus she had received piles of jewelry from Apollo at every single occasion. She wondered what this was about.\n\n \n\n\"This ring will act as a credit card linked to my accounts. When you need to purchase something just press the stone in the credit machine at stores. The ring will also let me know if you are injured.\"\n\n \n\nPercy eyed the ring with more curiosity now. Poseidon eyed the ring with displeasure. Apollo merely looked back at him.\n\n \n\n\"Percy has Will now uncle.\" The sun god said mildly to Poseidon. The sea god chose not to reply but helped his grandson in the saddle.\n\n \n\n\"Careful child. Cream will listen to you but you also must be careful with her.\"\n\n \n\nAs Percy watched Poseidon show Will the proper way to handle a pegasus, much to her son's delight she noticed Luke go near Lee and offer him the box he had been carrying. Lee opened the box, revealing a pair of sneakers. Lee frowned and asked Luke if he was sure. Luke told him not to worry about. Lee frowned a bit more but he took the box and thanked Luke, promising to bring the sneakers back intact. Luke smiled. His smile caused Percy to shiver. The son of Hermes then left, wishing her good luck.\n\n \n\nLee approached Foam and Percy was relieved to see him expertly handle the pegasus. Percy was the last to mount her pegasus. The gorgeous beasts beat their wings and carried them off. Percy looked down. Apollo was looking at her very intently, helpless despair on his twelve year old form. She smiled down at him before focusing on the way ahead. They needed to get to LA as soon as possible.\n\n \n\n~~~~\n\n \n\nPercy soared through the skies on Marble, her pegasus giften to her for the mission, her son Will and his brother Lee by her side. They were on a quest to find Zeus' stolen bolt, heading towards Los Angeles to search the underworld, the only place left unsearched. Percy, with memories of her past lives and her time in the underworld, knew it was absurd to think Hades was the culprit. In fact, she, Poseidon, Apollo, and Artemis theorized that Hades had also been robbed of his Helmet of Darkness. Which explained his behaviour of sending Mrs Dodds to torment Percy at Yancy and then the Minotaur as she headed to the camp.\n\n \n\nAfter six hours of flying, they decided to land near a bus station with a wood-fired pizzeria. As they entered, everyone stared and pointed at Percy. Lee snapped his fingers, and the people stopped staring.\n\n \n\n\"Lee, what did you just do?\" Percy asked, her eyes wide with curiosity.\n\n \n\nLee grinned. \"Dad taught me how to use a mist during his last visit to Will. It helps make us less noticeable.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, impressed. They took a table, and Percy grabbed a few newspapers, borrowing Lee's anti-dyslexia glasses. As she read, her expression darkened.\n\n \n\n\"What's wrong, Mom?\" Will asked, noticing her frown.\n\n \n\n\"These articles,\" Percy said, her voice trembling with anger.\n\n \n\n\"They're blaming me for my mother's disappearance. And Smelly Gabe... he's given several interviews, painting me as dangerous and unstable.\"\n\n \n\nFurious, Percy tossed the newspapers aside. Lee patted her shoulder in consolation, and expression of deep sympathy in his face. Not for the first time, Percy noticed his resemblance to her. Lee had similar curly dark hair and something around his cheekbones and eyebrows. His siblings also had similar small resemblances. Apollo had a type and it was people who looked like Hyacinthus and Icarus.\n\n\"I get it. I had a hard time with a guy my mom dated for nearly two years. He acted nice in front of my mom but was awful to me when it was just me and him. Then he came down with a severe case of leprosy.\"\n\n \n\nPercy managed a small smile. \"Apollo looks out for his kids.\"\n\n \n\nThey ordered their pizzas, with Percy suggesting a Pizza Margherita for Will, who was unsure about what to eat.\n\n \n\n\"It's the simplest type, still delicious and a good way to start on pizza,\" she explained.\n\n \n\nPercy ordered the same, while Lee went for a pepperoni. At Will's insistence, they also got seasonal salads and lemonade. They enjoyed their food, finding comfort in each other's company as they prepared for the challenges ahead.\n\n \n\nAfter finishing their meal, Percy called the waitress to pay. She used the credit card ring that Apollo had given her. Just then, three old women walked into the pizzeria. Percy recognized Mrs. Dodds, one of the Furies. All three transformed into their winged, clawed selves, brandished fiery whips and started screaming at her to hand it over.\n\n \n\n\"I don't have what you're looking for!\" Percy yelled back. \"I swear on the Styx that I haven't stolen Hades' Helmet or Zeus' Bolt.\"\n\n \n\nOne of the Furies paused, uncertain, but her two sisters screamed that it was a trick and they needed to attack. Percy pulled out Riptide, and Will and Lee readied their bows. Mrs. Dodds, identified as Alecto by one of her sisters, attacked first, aiming for Percy. Lee shot her multiple times, but it didn't stop the Fury. Percy leaped over the table and bisected Alecto in half. Lee shot the other Fury dead as he protected Will. Percy then stabbed the remaining Fury in the heart.\n\n \n\nThe people in the pizzeria panicked and tried to get out. Lee snapped his fingers multiple times to control the mist, but it was too hard. Percy, Will, and Lee decided to leave, running for their pegasi. They mounted the beasts and took to the skies.\n\n \n\nAfter flying for a few hours, the pegasi started acting strange near a highway. Instead of marching ahead, they were drawn to a statuary business. The pegasi flew down, and Percy was confused. She tried to order them back into the air, but her mind felt fuzzy.\n\"What's going on?\" Will asked, his voice tinged with worry.\n\"I don't know,\" Percy replied, shaking her head to clear the fog. \"Something's not right.\"\nLee dismounted and approached the statues. \"These statues... they look so lifelike.\"\nPercy followed, her eyes narrowing as she examined the statues. \"Be careful. This place gives me the creeps.\"\nSuddenly, a voice echoed from behind the statues. \"Welcome, travelers. I've been expecting you.\"\nA figure stepped out from the shadows, revealing a tall woman veiled from head to toe. Percy gasped as she looked at the woman and then at the statues.\n\"Medusa!\"\nMedusa laughed throatily. \"Indeed. I am she. I have been curious about you for so long, beloved of the sun. Since that lovely girl, your friend Smilax send to many of those animals to fight me.\"\n\n \n\n\"I don't want to fight,\" Medusa said. \"I'm curious about you, Percy, the third reincarnation of Hyacinthus. Come inside.\"\n\n \n\nThe three demigods drew their weapons but followed, realizing Medusa held the cards. Percy stepped in front of Will, and they all kept their eyes on the ground. Medusa led them to a section with tightly packed statues. They were cordoned off, separate from the rest. Medusa had shown little care in placing them. While the rest of the statues were quite artistically displayed, no such regard for those.\n\n \n\n\"These are children of Athena,\" Medusa said, her voice dripping with disgust. Percy looked at the statues, unable to bring herself to feel anything. Lee and Will looked rather horrified, having such good hearts. Truly having inherited the best of their father.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, or rather Icarus, should hate Athena as much as I do. A son of Athena had Alexios, the son of Icarus and Apollo, murdered when the child was three.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's blood froze, this was not how she wanted Will to find out what had happened to his prior incarnation.\n\n \n\nWill grabbed Percy's arm.\n\n \n\n\"Is this true?\"\n\n \n\nPercy admitted it was and asked how Medusa knew. Medusa explained,\n\n \n\n\"Gossip, being Hermes' domain, travels fast and reaches everywhere, even Tartarus.\"\n\n \n\nPercy felt a mix of anger and sadness.\n\n \n\n\"Why are you telling me this?\"\n\n \n\n\"Because you need to understand the stakes,\" Medusa replied.\n\n \n\n\"And perhaps, we can find common ground.\"\n\n \n\nPercy tightened her grip on Riptide.\n\n \n\n\"Common ground with you? After everything you've done?\" Percy shouted.\n\n \n\n\"You petrified two villages in the larger Lacedaemonia and one town near Sparta! I had to go there with Amyclas to supervise the statues being buried. One of the survivors, a woman who had been doing the laundry by the river when you passed hung herself on an olive tree when she saw her children's statues!\"\n\n \n\nMedusa sighed, waving a hand as if to say that it was all ancient history. Percy felt disgust. Medusa had once been a mortal human unjustly transformed into a monster. Some might even pity her for what had happened to her, having to pay the price for the crime of another. But the years had erroded any humanity she ever had and left just the monster.\n\n\"I don't expect forgiveness, but knowledge is power. Use it wisely.\" Medusa told her.\n\n \n\nThe tension in the air was palpable as Percy, Will, and Lee exchanged glances. They knew they had to be cautious, but the information Medusa provided could be crucial for their quest.\n\n \n\nPercy calculated, broke and asked, \"What kind of gossip have you heard?\"\n\n \n\nMedusa confirmed, \"Hades' Helmet of Darkness was stolen.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded. \"We had already guessed that given Hades's actions.\"\n\n \n\nMedusa then revealed, \"One of the gods sent out to find the bolt actually managed to catch the thief but chose not to report it.\"\n\n \n\nPercy was dubious. Why would any god keep it? The bolt could only be used by one of the Big Three, the same was true for the Trident and Helmet. They were made by the Elder Cyclops by the same divine material and given to the three youngest children of Rhea, her most powerful. Not even their sisters would be able to unlock the powers in the three items of vast, unfathomable power.\n\n \n\n\"Any child of Zeus would jump at the chance to return the bolt to their father and earn a great deal of favor. They would end up becoming the absolute favorite if they returned his stolen symbol of power.\"\n\n \n\nMedusa insisted, \"It is true, even if you don't want to believe it.\"\n\n \n\nAs Medusa started to lift her veil obviously done with the pretence, Percy splashed her head to toe with water from a nearby fountain and screamed at Will and Lee to close their eyes. She closed her eyes and focused on sensing the water on Medusa. She aimed at Medusa's neck, neatly separating the head from the body.\n\n \n\nPercy then removed her jacket and, with her eyes still closed, wrapped the head with her jacket. Once the head was securely covered, she let everyone know it was safe to open their eyes.\n\n \n\nLee looked at the covered head of Medusa in Percy's arms.\n\n \n\n\"It's too dangerous to carry with us. One little slip and we are stone.\"\n\n \n\nPercy agreed with Lee and started praying to Apollo, and her beloved answered in her head.\n\n \n\nPercy asked, \"Do you want to hold on to the head of Medusa?\"\n\n \n\nApollo was astonished and rather giddy.\n\n \n\n\"You slew Medusa?\" His voice was gleeful, typical Apollo.\n\n \n\n\"Yes,\" Percy replied. \"What should I do with the head?\"\n\n \n\n\"Go to the office and find a box with Hermes Express Delivery stamps on it,\" Apollo instructed.\n\n \n\nPercy did so and delivered the head to Apollo. It disappeared in a flash of light. Percy then perused Medusa's office. It was full of boxes and stamps. On the desk, there was a list. It detailed Medusa's list of customers. Her jaw dropping, Percy recognized many names. Persephone, Aphrodite, her aunt Calliope. Percy grimaced at that; the muse of epic poetry had always been nearly as bloodthirsty as a war deity. Apollo had often complained about Calliope's tendency to go near battlefields.\nPercy looked closely at the list and as relieved not to see the names of Apollo, Artemis, Clio or Poseidon on it. Athena was missing from there as well, but nearly every other god had ordered something in the last decade. She shuddered, seeing Zephyrus's name under an order for pretty young men with curly hair. She swallowed down bile as she flung the lists away from her and went to join her son and his brother. They had a quest to continue and needed to fly as quickly as they could toward LA.\n\nYep, Apollo is going to brag so much.\n\nPercy, Will and Lee meet a very pink poodle. Apollo brags.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the landscape, Percy, Will, and Lee soared through the sky on their pegasi in order to survey the area for more monsters. They had spotted none, likely all monsters were driven away by Medusa. The gorgon would not have wanted competition and they had seen a few monsters among her statues. The wind whipped through Percy's hair as she guided her steed, her mind racing with thoughts of their quest and the memories of her past lives.\n\n \n\n\"We are making good progress to LA,\" Will called out, his voice barely audible over the rush of wind.\n\n \n\n\"But it's getting dark. We should find a place to rest.\"\n\n \n\nPercy pulled out her phone and quickly searched for nearby accommodations.\n\n \n\n\"No hotels or motels nearby. Likely due to Medusa preying on the local populace,\" she said with a sigh. \"Lee, any ideas?\"\n\n \n\nLee glanced around and then pointed to the dark, foreboding structure below.\n\n \n\n\"How about we spend the night in Medusa's lair? It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing. The other option is camping in the woods.\"\n\n \n\nPercy hesitated, not wanting her son to spend the night in a massive graveyard filled with corpses masquerading as statues, but eventually nodded. It was better than camping in the woods. Medusa's lair would have the monster's scent imprinted all over and that would drive away lesser monsters.\n\n \n\n\"Alright, let's do it.\"\n\n \n\nThey landed their pegasi outside the lair and cautiously made their way back inside. The air was thick with the scent of stone and decay. With Medusa dead, the place had lost it's spark and liveliness. Percy and Will went to search for a place to sleep while Lee headed to the kitchen to find food.\n\n \n\nAfter a few minutes, Percy and Will found a few bedrooms that seemed relatively untouched.\n\n \n\n\"These will do,\" Percy said, her voice echoing in the empty halls.\n\n \n\nThey returned to the kitchen to find Lee had prepared a few sandwiches, a large salad, and helpings of fruit. Percy raised an eyebrow at the healthy spread. She could see a deep frier, several backs of ready to fry french fries, burger buns and many condiments. Finding the healthy food must have been a challenge. Leave it to a son of Apollo to manage to find the grilled chicken, dark leavy greens, fresh fruits and whole wheat bread in a fast food monster trap.\n\n \n\n\"Impressive, Lee. I see you avoided the junk food.\"\n\n \n\nLee and Will made identical faces of disgust. It reminded Percy of the times Apollo was presented with certain overly stinky cheeses and breads spread with too much butter. Apollo made the exact same face. Percy wondered if Asclepius had been the same, if he was still the same. Most likely, Percy's firstborn son was the god of Medicine. Every hospital also doubled as a temple to Asclepius. How often had she seen the Rod of Asclepius in her twelve years, never dreaming that it was the symbol of power of her own son.\n\n \n\n\"Who needs burgers and fries when you have this?\" Lee said with a smile, proudly gesturing to the food.\n\n \n\nPercy laughed and they sat down to eat. Their meal was interrupted by a small barking sound. Percy looked down to see a miniature poodle dyed pink.\n\n \n\n\"Well, hello there,\" she said, reaching down to pet the little dog. She shredded some chicken and placed it in a spare plate along with some water in a bowl.\n\n \n\n\"Here you go, little guy.\"\n\n \n\nAs the dog ate and drank, Percy checked his collar.\n\n \n\n\"His name is Gladiola, even though he's a male.\"\n\n \n\nWill chuckled as he speared spinach and arugula with his fork.\n\n \n\n\"Gladiola, huh? Like the fancy flower? Quite the name for a little dog.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled and looked at her companions.\n\n \n\n\"You know, in my past lives, dogs were nothing like this. They were big, menacing, and used for hunting and guarding. If my past incarnations saw Gladiola, they'd probably think he was a deformed bunny. Or a mortal transformed into a strange creature as punishment by a god.\"\n\n \n\nLee laughed. \"Times have changed, Percy. Now we have dogs like Gladiola to keep us company.\"\n\n \n\nThey continued to eat and talk, sharing stories and memories as the night wore on. Despite the eerie surroundings, they found comfort in each other's company and the bond they shared.\n\n \n\nAfter dinner, they used the showers to wash up and decided to room together for safety. They chose the larger bedroom with a king-size bed and a couch by the windows. Lee took the couch while Percy and Will took the bed.\n\n \n\nAs they settled in, Will turned to Percy.\n\n \n\n\"Mom, what did Medusa mean about a son of Athena killing my past incarnation, Alexios?\"\n\n \n\nPercy started trembling, deeply hurt by the memory. She stared into the distance. She would have preferred to wait until Will was older to tell him but Medusa nixed that plan with her big mouth. Better to tell the truth, rather than have Will imagine the worse scenarios.\n\n \n\n\"Alexios was three. A son of Athena, and thus brother to Daedalus, visited Crete and presented himself as a guest in our home. Sacred hospitality, Xenia was divinely mandated back then, so Daedalus had to accept his half-brother in our home. But he had misgivings since he never liked his mother Athena or any of his siblings. Icarus didn't like how his half-uncle looked at him sometimes.\"\n\n \n\nPercy took a deep breath.\"During a feast, the son of Athena made friends with a member of the old Cretan nobility who resented Minos for inheriting the throne, despised Daedalus for inventing sails and ending Crete's isolation, and feared demigods as harbingers of change. The nobleman hired assassins to kidnap and murder Alexios. Apollo felt the moment Alexios died and rushed down from Olympus to catch the killers. They confessed who hired them, and the nobleman snitched on the son of Athena. Apollo and Icarus ensured they suffered. Icarus appealed to a friend, a son and priest of Hades, to ensure they were harshly punished in the Fields of Punishment for all eternity. During Alexios funeral Daedalus told me that he wished he had killed his brother the moment he stepped foot in Crete. Daedalus said that he was already a kinslayer, what was one more.\"\n\n \n\nWill reached out and held Percy's hand.\n\n \n\n\"I'm sorry, Mom.\"\n\n \n\nPercy squeezed his hand back, grateful for his support. She brushed his curls away from his face and kissed his forehead. Percy relished on the feeling of her son being in her arms, warm, breathing and alive. He would stay that way or she would turn this world to ashes. She was already destined to do so after all.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you, Will. Let's get some rest. We have a long journey ahead of us.\"\n\n \n\nThey settled in for the night, the weight of their quest heavy on their minds. It took Percy a while but eventually her son's even breathing lulled her to sleep. Riptide was in her hair, her trident in ring form in her left thumb, her bow on her right wrist in bracelet form and her polished dagger under her pillow. She caught some visions in that dagger, images shifting and twisting so fast. When she had time she would need to study the dagger in depth to figure out what the images in it were.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~Meanwhile, in Olympus, Apollo paraded the Head of Medusa, bragging about his beloved slaying the monster. A feat done only once before. By Perseus, son of Zeus and Danae and even that ancient hero had to slay Medusa in her sleep. Percy did so while Medusa was awake. Apollo preened, utterly delighted. It helped him deal with the fears and uncertainties of Percy's future, of this horrible quest forced upon his beloved and their son. Both his sons. Apollo loved Lee, as well.\n\n \n\nApollo was attended by the nine muses and their mother, Mnemosyne. Clio, the mother of Hyacinthus, and Mnemosyne both recalled something at the sight of the Head of Medusa.\n\n \n\n\"May we consult your library of prophecies, Apollo?\" Clio asked, wanting to confirm her suspicions. Memnosyne nodded eagerly at her daughter's side.\n\n \n\nApollo, still bragging to Hermes and Aphrodite, just waved the hand not holding the griesly spoil of war and absently nodded in their direction.\n\n \n\n\"Of course. Anything for my beloved's triumph.\"\n\n \n\nHermes, vaguely jealous, muttered,\n\n \n\n\"I helped Perseus with his Medusa quest, but he gave the head to Athena. I would have liked to have the Head of Medusa, if only so my snakes could talk to the snakes in her head and have some company.\"\n\n \n\nAphrodite, less concerned with the head, was more intrigued by the real reason Icarus died.\"Apollo, why didn't you tell me that Icarus was blackmailed by the Fates to kill himself? He sacrificed himself to save the love of his life! It's so romantic, tragic, and sad!\"\"As the goddess of love I had a right to know! This is one of the greatest love stories and I did not even know! I had to find out from Artemis mentioning it in front of my children. Artemis who knows nothing of love knew before me!\"\n\n \n\nApollo sighed. Aphrodite could be such a vulture when it came to suffering caused by love. He had not said a word for a reason. He did not need her harping on him about it. She would have constantly thrown salt in his wounds just to satisfy her craving for tragic love.\n\n \n\nApollo's expression darkened but kept himself in check. He needed Aphrodite to vote to keep Percy alive.\n\n \n\n\"It was a painful memory. I needed to grieve in peace.\"\n\n \n\nHermes snorted, sipping his nectar and wine drink and eyeing the head of Medusa with covetous eyes. Apollo decided to keep it close at hand. It would not be the first time Hermes has robbed him.\n\n\"What peace? You were so unpeaceful that you caused the Fall of the Late Bronze Age because you were upset about Icarus. I get it but my domains were in shambles! Do you think that trade flourishes during droughts, plagues, famines and constant raiding and warfare?\"\n\n \n\nClio and Mnemosyne returned, clutching an ancient scroll. Clio spoke, addressing Apollo.\n\n \n\n\"There is a prophecy predicting that Medusa would be slain by a son of Zeus with Spartan blood, meaning Perseus of Argo. The prophecy also predicted that Medusa would rise again to torment the world once more before being slain by the sun's third beloved. It dates back to when my son was about ten years old in Sparta.\"\n\n \n\nAll the gods attending Apollo's party paused. Hermes was astonished.\n\n \n\n\"Prophecies can be made that far in advance? More than three thousand years?\"\n\n \n\nAphrodite wondered aloud,\n\n \n\n\"Was it fated for Prince Hyacinthus to live three times?\"\n\n \n\nClio glared at Aphrodite but stayed silent. Apollo took the scroll and read the prophecy silently, the weight of its words sinking in.\n\n \n\nOf Medusa's fate, her reign undone.A son of Zeus, from Sparta's line,Would face the Gorgon, fierce and fine.With shield of bronze and sword of light,He'd end her terror in the night.Yet from the depths, she'd rise once more,To cast her curse upon the shore.Her gaze would turn the brave to stone,Her wrath would chill them to the bone.But hope would shine, a beacon bright,The sun's third love would join the fight.With heart so pure and courage true,They'd end the Gorgon's reign anew.Medusa's power would fade away,And peace would dawn, a brand new day.\n\n \n\nCalliope, the Muse of Epics, looked up from her poem honoring Percy's victory. She wasn't surprised that Artemis wasn't there; if Aphrodite attended, Artemis did not. But she would have expected Ares to be interested, given Hyacinthus' Spartan heritage and the significance of Medusa's final slaying.\n\n \n\nCalliope spoke up, \"Why isn't Ares here?\"\n\n \n\nAphrodite smirked. \"He's preparing a special date for me.\"\n\n \n\nCalliope giggled.\n\n \n\n\"Have fun, Aphrodite. But I hope Ares doesn't get surly about missing a party honoring a Spartan Prince. I don't want to be chased off battlefields because he's sore.\"\n\n \n\nApollo sighed, looking up from the scroll at his most troublesome muse.\n\n \n\n\"Calliope, I hope your hobby of observing battlefields doesn't land you in the infirmary again.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius emerged from where he was talking to Hebe. The son of Apollo and Hyacinthus had chosen a very young form, about twelve years old, in contrast to his usual appearance of a man in his late thirties or early forties.\n\n \n\n\"Aunt Calliope, please don't step on another minefield.\" He implored her.\n\n \n\nCalliope bristled. \"It doesn't happen that often.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius replied, \"It's happened fifteen times in the last decade.\"\n\n \n\nCalliope justified her mishaps with minefields with a mulish expression on her face,\"It is due to Tyche, the goddess of luck, holding a grudge because I went for one of her lovers before she was done with him. I am neither careless or clumsy dear nephew.\"\n\n \n\nAphrodite zeroed in on Calliope, surprised.\n\n \n\n\"You and my daughter Tyche have the same taste in men?\"\n\n \n\nCalliope nodded with a glowing and nostalgic smile.\n\n \n\n\"He was a very dashing and adventurous gambler who was secretly a CIA agent with a very decorated career. Our domains intersected. What a fine male specimen!\"\n\n \n\nApollo told Asclepius,\n\n \n\n\"Go to Hephaestus and commission some jewelry to appease Tyche so she stops making trouble for Calliope. He should know what she likes. I have never seen Tyche without a few pounds of jewelry on.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius asked,\n\n \n\n\"Why don't you do it yourself? Hephaestus is more likely to prioritize another Olympian than a minor god like me.\"\n\n \n\nApollo replied,\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus is once again alive. The only people I'm going to commission jewelry for are Percy and Leto. Artemis never cared for jewelry. Besides, Hephaestus likes you more because you tried longer and harder to help him with his legs.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius left for Hephaestus' forge, Hebe following him. Hebe was glad that Asclepius no longer made himself look old. The goddess of youth found wrinkles and age spots on a god to be utterly unsightly and never understood why some gods would inflict themselves so.\n\n \n\n\"I am the divine embodiment of a doctor and healer. Mortals imagine me to be at least middle aged. I used that form so mortals had an easier time understanding me.\"\n\n \n\n\"Why did you change your mind?\" she asked.\n\n \n\nAsclepius replied,\n\n \n\n\"Percy, the reincarnation of my mortal parent Hyacinthus, is currently twelve years old. While Percy took the news of my existence rather well, having a son that looks much older than her would be disorienting. I'm choosing to look young so it's easier for her.\"\n\n \n\nHebe linked her arm to his and promised to tell him all about being young. Asclepius admitted to the goddess of youth with a smile.\n\n \n\n\"In this topic, you are the expert. It's been a long time since I felt young. In fact, I doubt if I ever felt young.\"\n\nShort chapter yes, but work has been killing me and it is only Tuesday. It is going to be a long week.\n\nPercy falls, Apollo reacts\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nThey woke up with the dawn and left Medusa's lair after supplying themselves with food from the kitchen. Lee also went through Medusa's office, securing any valuables there. Will seemed discomfited by in but Percy explained that they were spoils of war. After killing a monster or defeating an enemy city it was customary to carry off the valuables fo the defeated. Had Medusa triumphed over them, she would have certainly taken all they had of value if it did not petrify. And she would have definitely sold their corpses.\n\nGladiola the dog was an issue. They did some google sleuthing about the dog. While he had owners, said owners were very irresponsible and borderline abusive. Gladiola had run off multiple times and had been returned to his owners by people wanting the rewards. Percy decided to use one of the Hermes Express boxes for live animals to send Gladiola to the Hunters for the duration of the quest. Polyboea had always been fond of dogs and would take excellent care of the dog. Percy would decide what to do with the dog afterwards. She would likely end up keeping it if camp allowed it. It would do Will good to have a pet. As Alexios he had been fond of songbirds and cats, even Icarus' fierce hunting dogs. Which neither Daedalus or Ariadne had liked much. Percy thought that Ariadne might liked a cute little lapdog much better those for hunting.\n\nTo avoid exhausting their pegasi, they decided to take the Amtrak train to St. Louis. They booked a family-size bedroom suite while their pegasi, Marble, Cream, and Foam, perched on top of the train, hidden by Lee's use of the Mist. Thanks to Apollo's credit card ring, money was no issue. Lee tried to insist on paying his share with the spoils they had gotten from Medusa but Percy overruled him. Lee needed to keep that money for himself.\n\n \n\nPercy pointed to the window with a delighted smile.\"Look, Will, that's the Mississippi River. It's one of the longest rivers in the world. It is part of the Mississippi-Missouri-Jefferson-Beaverhead-Red Rock-Hell Roaring river system which is the fourth longest in the world, measuring 6,275 km or 3,902 miles.\"\"Did you know it played a crucial role in the Civil War?\"Will moved closer to the window to look at what she pointed at.\n\n \n\n\"Wow, Mom, that's amazing! Tell me more about it.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled as she recalled that particular lesson. History had always been easy to learn and pay attention to in class.\"Well, the Union forces aimed to control the river to split the Confederacy in two. It was a major strategic point.\"\"I never knew that. Thanks for telling me, Mom.\"Camp education was limited, even if Apollo did his best to bridge the gap for his kids with the anti dyslexia glasses and gifts of books, study guides and materials. In the Apollo cabin, only Will, Michael and Victoria were year rounders. Will because Percy was unfindable and Michael and Victoria because they had lost their mothers. Michael when he was very young, even before Apollo was forced to take Will to camp and Victoria more recently.Occasionally, the pegasi hovered by their window, and Percy would talk to them and feed them. Luckily pegasi could eat everything vegetarian, even bread and sweets. Percy could almost heard Crocus scolding her about being too indulgent and spoiling their mounts. As Hyacinthus she had been a bit jealous of Crocus' ability to understand equine creatures. It had made Crocus a formidable chariotier. Had Crocus been allowed to drive a chariot from childhood he would have been undefeatable. Back then though pegasi were rather rare. Pegasus himself had not been around for that long, having been born shortly after Medusa's transformation, a mere one hundred years when Hyacinthus was prince. The pegasi that Pegasus had produced were mostly kept in Olympus, but eventually trickled down. Daedalus had seen a few during his time at camp, even though they did not allow themselves to be ridden by children of Athena.\n\n \n\nWhen Will fell asleep curled up next to Percy, Lee took the opportunity to ask Percy about their final destination. The underworld itself. Percy remembered her arrivals as Hyacinthus and Icarus acutely but the leaving it to be reborn was fuzzy. The first time it was formal procedure. Hyacinthus applied for rebirth the moment it was offered after being granted Elysium by Hades. The paperwork involved meant that it took about a century for everything to go through but Icarus loved Apollo again.\n\n \n\nAs Icarus, after a very long judgement by Hades he was granted Elysium. Icarus had no idea that rebirth was possible. It was one of the attendants of the lord of the Underworld who mentioned it as Icarus was being shown out but Hades said no. He would not allow Icarus to be reborn because Apollo was unreasonable. It had taken Zagreus going against Hades' wishes for Percy to exist.\n\n \n\n\"Percy, what can we expect from the underworld? You've been there before, right?\"Percy covered her son with a soft throw blanket to make him more comfortable and answered.\n\n \n\n\"Yes, in my life as Hyacinthus, I visited the underworld while alive like we intend to do now. One of Mnemosyne's sacred pools of memory spilled into the Eurotas River, and I was given a quest to retrieve Lethe water from the underworld.\"\n\n \n\nLee's eyes widened. Completely astonished. Mortal remembrance had not been kind to her first incarnation. All people remembered about Hyacinthus was his beauty. Percy recalled a painting she had seen in an art documentary, titled 'The Empire of Flora' by Nicolas Poussin, showing all mythological characters transformed into flowers as victims of the goddess Chloris. Smilax and Crocus had been there, along with Adonis, Clytie, Narcissus, Echo, and Ajax. The speaker had referred to her first incarnation as the 'beautiful Hyacinthus' multiple times. Adonis had been referred as 'the young huntsman'. It was really unfair. To add further insult, the painting depicted Hyacinthus as blonde, when he had glossy black curls.\n\n \n\n\"How did you manage that?\" Lee wanted to know.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo helped me by tying a golden chain around my waist to keep track of me because he was not allowed in. I took an ivory box filled with expensive incense as an offering to Hades. I got past Cerberus by giving him Spartan spiced honey cakes and playing with the three-headed dog. He might look fearsome but he is a very sweet dog\"Lee raised his eyebrows at the formidable guard dog of the Underworld being referred as sweet. Percy jut smiled at him. Cerberus was a good boy.\n\n \n\n\"And what about the ghosts? I have read that the ghosts can be a hindrance too.\" Lee leaned closer, very curious.\n\n \n\nPercy grimaced as she recalled who those ghosts had been. The spiteful Diomede and the lustful Aristodamia.\"They can be yes, the ghost would be lost loved ones or dead enemies. In my case it was enemies since I had not lost any loved ones at that point.\"\n\n \n\nPercy tapped the armrest of the seat, grimacing as she recalled the cold eyed and spiteful ghosts.\n\n \n\n\"The goddess Melinoe sent the ghosts of my stepmothers to drive me away, but I managed to collect the water. I then pressed a gem that turned the golden chain red, signaling Apollo to pull me back to the world of the living.\"\n\n \n\nAs Percy blushed, her cheeks burning as she recalling what Hyacinthus and Apollo had done right after. It had been Hyacinthus' first time. Lee noticed and laughed, feeling somewhat grossed out.\n\n \n\n\"Oh, come on, Percy! Really?\" Humour won out because Lee dissolved into peals of laughter.\n\n \n\n\"Shut up, Lee!\" She yelled and kicked him in the shin. Lee only laughed harder.\n\n \n\nThe commotion woke up Will, who startled up, his eyes desperately seeking Percy.\"Mom? Are you here?\"Percy immediately hugged her son.\"I'm here, Will. I'll do everything in my power to keep us together.\"\n\n \n\nLee decided to send an Iris Message to camp. Sometimes cell phones could attract monsters, even if Hephaestus' designs didn't, so Lee wanted to avoid risking attracting a monster while they were on the train. He contacted his brother Michael.\n\n \n\nMichael responded with a very sour face.\"Lee, it's chaos here. I'm stuck being the de facto cabin leader while you're away.\"\n\n \n\nLee seemed almost smug at his brother's suffering. It reminded Percy of the times Apollo took Hyacinthus away from Sparta and it made people realise just how much Hyacinthus did to help run the kingdom. Seeing their dismayed faces had always been satisfying. No one likes being taken for granted after all. Hyacinthus himself had realised it after Smilax had died and suddenly court factions became much harder to handle. Polyboea had stepped up magnificently but Smilax had left a huge mark on the Spartan royal court. Percy silently said a prayer for her ancient friend. She could vaguely recall both Smilax and Crocus waiting for Hyacinthus at the gates of Elysium but nothing else.\n\n \n\n\"Hang in there, Michael. By the way, did you see the news? The slaying of Medusa should have made the Olympus Weekly.\"\n\n \n\nMichael looked as if he had bitten on a lemon.\n\n \n\n\"Yeah, I saw. Dad threw a huge party about it and Pheme predicts that he will be bragging about it for years. Do you really want me to waste gold drachmas to send you a copy?\"\n\n \n\nLee just shrugged.\n\n \n\n\"We got plenty from Medusa's lair. Just send it via Hermes express.\"\n\n \n\nMichael signed but nodded.\n\n \n\n\"Fine. But listen, camp almost divided over the Olympian conflict. Chiron had to put his hoof down to stop the infighting. He even scolded Annabeth and Luke.\"\n\n \n\nPercy was surprised but said nothing. The centaur was likely afraid that his little darlings would get smacked down if a real fight started. Percy knew for a fact that Clarisse and a couple of her sisters had been itching for an excuse to pound the spoiled girl into the dirt.\n\n \n\n\"Is Annabeth still mad that I got the quest and not her?\"\n\n \n\nMichael actually chuckled. His dark eyes shining with glee. Every single member of the Apollo cabin had been displeased to hear her disparage their brother and cabin leader.\n\n \n\n\"She's pretty angry, but Luke's talking to her.\"\n\n \n\nPercy recalled that before they left, Luke had given Lee a box. Percy had meant to ask but something always came up. She almost smacked herself. Luke really liked to indulge Annabeth and he had definitely not been happy that Percy had hit the Athena girl.\n\n \n\n\"Lee, what was in that box Luke gave you?\"\n\n \n\nLee turned to her,, looking away from his brother.\n\n \n\n\"Flying shoes from his father, Hermes.\"\n\n \n\nPercy sat up, astonished. As Hyacinthus she had not even allowed Polyboea to touch the gifts received from Clio. Ariadne also had not been granted permission to hold any gifts that Icarus had received from Artemis. Did Hermes truly mean so little to Luke? Icarus had exchanged letters with Cydon's foster mother. The little boy had been desperate for any scrap of attention from Hermes. Cydon had been given a gold statue of his father on his third birthday and he had allowed no one to touch it.\n\n \n\n\"He just gave away a divine gift? That's... strange.\"\n\n \n\n\"Luke's always been generous. But don't worry, I won't use them near LA. Hades isn't fond of messenger gods entering his kingdom.\" Lee reasured her as he said goodbye to a grumbling Michael.\n\n \n\n\"Good. Just be careful. Luke's being a little too helpful.\"\n\n \n\nPercy told him but Lee was no longer paying attention. A copy of the Olympus Weekly appeared on his lap and he put on his anti dyslexia glasses. Lee beame engrossed in the articles. Percy caught sight of the picture of a twelve year old looking grinning Apollo swinging the head of Medusa with glee. He was flanked by a proudly smiling Clio and and an eagerly grinning Calliope. Percy would need to steal the paper once Lee was done with it. Will looked curious but he did not move closer. He was not allowed to read Olympus Weekly unsupervised since it often discussed subject matter not suitable for children. Like Zeus latest dalliance with a nymph or a male mortal. Percy had even asked Dionysus about it since gods could produce demigods with nymphs but had been assured that it had not happened since the fall of Troy. Whenever gods reproduced with nymphs it was either more nymphs or monsters. Zeus was not going to produce anymore Thalias but he might produce more monsters for other demigods to fight.\n\n \n\nPercy felt uneasy about the shoes and the so very helpful demigod who had gifted them to Lee. Luke, the son of the god of thieves, was a natural thief and mischief-maker. And with Annabeth, who had a cap of invisibility, wrapped around his finger, it painted a picture Percy didn't like. Still, she decided to stay quiet for now, trusting Lee's high regard for Luke. Besides, Lee had known her for barely more than a week and he had known and trusted Luke for years.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nThe Amtrak train hissed to a stop at St. Louis, Missouri. Percy Jackson, her son Will, and Lee Fletcher stepped off, stretching their legs. Being in a small, confined space was torture for demigods, especially those who were used to large spaces to roam through.\n\n \n\n\"We have three hours before the next train to Denver. Let's get some real food and check out the Arch.\" Percy told Will and Lee.\n\n \n\nWill smiled at her. \"Sounds good, Mom. Anything's better than train food.\"\n\n \n\nLee stretched exageratedly. \"I second that. Let's go!\"\n\n \n\nThey found a cozy diner nearby with healthy enough dishes for two sons of Apollo and enjoyed a hearty meal. Afterward, they made their way to the Gateway Arch. At the base, Will and Lee started debating on the drinks that they would take with them to Denver and beyond. At least they agreed on snacks.\n\n \n\n\"Water is way better than orange juice. It's hydrating and has no sugar.\" A true grandchild of a water god.\"But orange juice has vitamins and tastes better!\" Lee argued back.\n\n \n\n\"Orange juice also spoils easily! Water does not spoil!\" Was what Will had to say to that.\n\n \n\n\"Water goes stale!\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled at their banter but her expression quickly changed when she spotted a familiar, menacing figure in the crowd. The mist kept trying to mask them as a large, middle aged woman with a small dog, but as Hyacinthus and Icarus she had seen enough depictions of Echidna and Chimera to see what they were.\n\n \n\nPercy told the still arguing boys.\n\n \n\n\"Will, Lee, stay here. I need to check something.\"\n\n \n\nShe moved swiftly, her eyes locked on Echidna and the Chimera. She had to lead them away from her son. Percy entered the Arch and pulled the fire alarm, causing a loud blare and people to evacuate.\n\n \n\nEchidna followed after her, holding her son by his leash.\n\n \n\n\"You can't run from us, demigod!\"\n\n \n\nPercy stoped at the very top of the Arch and addressed the monsters.\n\n \n\n\"I'm not running.\"\n\n \n\nShe brandished Riptide, her trusty sword. The Chimera snarled and transformed, its lion head roaring, goat head bleating, and snake tail hissing.\n\n \n\nPercy grimaced at the two monsters.\n\n \n\n\"Come on, then. Let's dance.\"\n\n \n\nThe battle was on.\n\n \n\nEchidna laughed at her.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus and Athena sent us. You won't find the bolt.\"\n\n \n\nPercy scowled, what the heck was wrong with Zeus. Did he not want his stupid sparkler back? Thinking back at Olympus Weekly, Percy started to pray out loud, hoping that the goddess that she was about to invoke was listening.\n\n \n\n\"Pheme, goddess of Rumour, why is Zeus so desperate to stop me? Was the bolt even stolen, or is this just a ploy to accuse Poseidon and start a war? Athena may cloak it in wisdom, but she's still a goddess of war, just like Ares. And Zeus has always loved to spoil Athena rotten.\"\n\n \n\nThe Chimera lunged at Percy. She dodged and fought back with Riptide, drawing the beast into a corner. Discreetly, she removed the ring her father gave her, and it transformed into a trident. The trident, hollow and filled with water, allowed Percy to control it as easily as any sea water. She impaled the Chimera from behind, and the beast dissolved into gold dust.\n\n \n\nEchidna shrieked with rage and greif as she saw her son destroyed and sent back to Tartarus.\n\n \n\n\"No! You'll pay for that!\"\n\n \n\nEchidna screamed again, transforming into a half-serpent form, and charged at Percy. With a powerful shove, Echidna pushed Percy off the Arch. As she fell, memories of her life as Icarus flashed before her eyes. She sensed the waters of the Mississippi below and called them to her.\n\n \n\n\"Not this time. I won't fall again.\"\n\n \n\nThe waters of the Mississippi exploded, jumping up towards Percy. She saw the sun go black as she fell into the waters, unharmed. The few scrapes from the scuffle with the Chimera healed right away. Percy swam up, desperate to look for Will. She saw Will and Lee at the shore, Will crying and the sun still black. A child pointed to Percy, telling his mother that she was dry despite emerging from the river. The mother scolded him for saying nonsense. Percy briefly pitied the boy. It was not easy to see through the mist.Percy spotted her son and his brother and run toward them.\n\n \n\n\"Will! Lee!\" She called out.\n\n \n\nLee waved his hands at the sky, where the sun was supposed to be.\n\n \n\nLee called out.\n\n \n\n\"Dad, look! Percy is perfectly fine!\"\n\n \n\nPercy herself waved at the black sun. Guilt eating at her for putting Apollo through this twice. She sent a quick prayer to her beloved, reassuring him once more that he was fine. Slowly, light started to appear at the edges of the black disk in the sky. Percy kept looking up while hugging Will. A very tall man in a blue suit emerged from the waters of the Mississippi. He had long black hair styled in a ponytail and green eyes like Percy and Will.\n\n \n\nPercy recognized him. Crocus had several mosaics of his godly family, their godly family. Also, Percy could sense his aura, similar to Poseidon, but much calmer and nowhere as powerful.\n\n \n\n\"Lord Triton?\"\n\n \n\nTriton nodded at her, visibly pleased to be recognized.\n\n \n\n\"Brother, Percy. Call me Brother.\"Percy smiled at him as she soothed a crying Will. She found it hard to bow in respect to her godly brother.\n\n \n\nTriton's default stern expression softened a bit when he saw Will's tears.\n\n \n\n\"Tend to your child. I have a message from our father. Poseidon is preparing special magic pearls that will allow you, Will, and Lee to escape the Underworld if things go badly. The pearls will be delivered at Santa Monica by me once they are ready.\"\n\n \n\nPercy tried to give as much of a bow as she could while holding Will.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you, Brother.\"\n\n \n\nTriton's expression grew a little fierce.\n\n \n\n\"Beware Athena's machinations, Percy.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, Triton disappeared back into the waters, leaving Percy to comfort her son and prepare for the next leg of their quest. They went back to the train station, not wanting to risk any more sightseeing. Will finally stopped crying but insisted on holding on to her. Apollo's sunlight shinned insistently upon her, feeling anguished. They boarded the train, Percy making sure to stay near the window to reassure Apollo of her living status and perfect health. A copy of the Olympus Weekly appeared on the one of the unoccupied seats, a small conch shell over it. Lee grabbed the paper while Percy took hold of the shell.\n\n \n\n\"A special edition of Olympus Weekly!\" Lee spoke.\"Pheme hardly does this. It is about the attack on you by Echidna and Chimera.\"\n\n \n\nLee showed Percy a picture of her killing the Chimera with a flying trident. Percy smiled. Also, another of Echidna is pushing her off the Arch. Percy grimaced, imagining Apollo's rage.\n\n \n\n\"Apparently, Dad is hunting Echidna. Multiple gods overheard him threaten to skin her alive.\"\n\n \n\nPercy snorted, that was the default method Apollo had to deal with whoever wronged him. Now, to Denver. Hopefully they would not encounter any more monsters. Lee read the articles out loud. Pheme had heard her speculation and had written multiple articles theorizing that the bolt might have never been stolen and it was just a ruse to declare war on Poseidon. Pheme had unearthed an old rumour about how Zeus got Hestia to step down and give her throne to Dionysus. Back then he had also used the threat of war. Pheme had even written articles on multiple godly children of Zeus that he might want to replace Poseidon with. Enyo was the first in that list. Hopefully, with all this scrutiny, Zeus would not send anymore monsters.\n\n \n\nDuring the train ride, Percy noticed several people cough and look feverish. She looked at the sun with wide eyes. Percy hoped that the unscheduled eclipse was all but it was unlikely. Percy's fall from the St. Louis Arch had reminded Apollo of a very traumatic and horrific memory. If this was a plague, she hoped it would be mild and go away quickly.\n\nPercy was born in 2007 and when she falls of the St. Louis Arch it is the year 2019\n\nPercy has a very annoying sidequest. Ares makes himself the number one suspect.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nThe rhythmic clatter of the Amtrak train provided a soothing backdrop as Percy Jackson, her son Will, and Lee Fletcher settled into their seats. Lee was engrossed in the latest issue of Olympus Weekly, his brow furrowed in concentration. Percy was convincing Will to try some tapioca pudding. Will was still suspicious of anything sweet.\n\n \n\n\"Listen to this,\" Lee said, breaking the moment. Mother and son turned to look at him. Lee grinned at them, looking very smug.\n\n \n\n\"Pheme, the goddess of rumor, is speculating about who could have stolen Zeus' lightning bolt. She says Poseidon swore on the Styx that it wasn't him. Apollo and Hermes, Olympus' two living lie detectors, confirmed he was telling the truth.\"\n\n \n\nPercy leaned back, her eyes narrowing. She already knew this, Artemis had told her when they were still at camp. But Pheme apparently had not known, or had known and waited for the right moment to publish that particular titbit. If she had not known, who had told her. Was it one of Poseidon's and Apollo's faction or someone else? The one that was trying to send Olympus into war?\n\n \n\n\"But Zeus pointed out that Poseidon has broken the oath before, right?\" Percy asked.\n\n \n\n\"Exactly,\" Lee replied with an eyeroll.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus thinks Apollo could be lying out of love for you, the third incarnation of Hyacinthus, and Hermes might be lying because of his lingering affection for Crocus, Poseidon's son and Hyacinthus' best friend. Pheme also reports that Zeus never addresses you by your name, just as the third incarnation of Hyacinthus. I wonder why.\"\n\n \n\nWill, who had been staring out the window, turned to face them.\n\n \n\n\"That sounds like Zeus is reaching. He's trying to justify accusing my granddad without any proof.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, wondering why Zeus was so reluctant to refer to her by her actual name. Was it because her legal name was Perseus, like Zeus' famous demigod son? It was not like she could ask. Her least favorite uncle did not like questions.\n\n \n\n\"Agreed. Zeus has always been quick to point fingers, especially when it comes to Poseidon.\"\n\n \n\nLee folded the newspaper and set it aside. He grabbed one of the tapioca puddings and one of the spoons. Percy smiled, at least one son of Apollo did not need to be coaxed to eat sweets.\n\n \n\n\"Well, we have our own quest to focus on. Let's just hope we find the bolt before things get even more complicated.\"\n\n \n\nAn hour before their arrival in Denver, they took turns using the shower in their family-sized bathroom. Percy was the first to step out, toweling her hair dry.\n\n \n\n\"Your turn, Will,\" she said, smiling at her son.\n\n \n\nWill grabbed his towel and headed into the bathroom. As the door closed behind him, Lee glanced at Percy.\n\n \n\n\"Do you ever wonder why Zeus is so paranoid?\"\n\n \n\nPercy sighed, she would love to blame that so called Olympian Riot but she remembered Clio's lessons. Zeus had been paranoid well before that. He had conspired with Metis to assign his eldest brother and thus the most rightful heir the domain of the Underworld and keep him safely out of the way, and given himself the domain of the Sky. The traditional domain of the supreme immortal ruler of the world. Ouranos had held it, then Kronos and now Zeus. When a prophecy stated that Metis would bear a son greater than Zeus, he had immediately destroyed her, despite his love for her and all she had done for him. Still, this was not knowledge to be repeated out loud in the open, Zeus after all might be listening.\n\n\"All the time. But right now, we need to stay focused. We can't let his paranoia distract us from our mission.\"\n\n \n\nLee nodded in agreement as he sorted out his towels and toiletries. Percy mentally thanked Apollo for his credit card ring. She shuddered to imagine what a nightmare this quest would have been without it.\n\n \n\n\"You're right. Let's just hope we can find the bolt like the prophecy said and clear Poseidon's name.\"\n\n \n\nAs the train continued its journey, the three demigods prepared themselves for the challenges that lay ahead, determined to uncover the truth and restore balance to Olympus. The more Percy thought about it, the most likely it was that one of the war gods was responsible for this. They were the only ones that would profit from a war. The problem was, which war god. Zeus alone had produced Ares, Enyo and Athena. Ares had Phobos and Deimos. It could also be Eris, Zeus and Hera's most troublesome child. Percy wondered if Apollo or Hermes had managed to corner her for questioning but the goddess of discord could be quite slippery. Never to be found when wanted around, and popping up like a poisonous mushroom when she was not wanted. The Golden Apple incident might be the most famous but it was by no means the only one.\n\n \n\nWhen they arrived in Denver, the trio tried to find transportation to continue their journey west to Los Angeles. Despite Lee's attempts to use the Mist, something was making the mortals frightened of them, and they were unable to rent a car. After the sixth agency turned them away they gave up. No car rental was to be found. Buses were too crowded. With Percy's face everywhere as a wanted fugitive, Lee would not be able to keep his mist manipulation all the time. Taking the Amtrak again was not possible. The line was shutting down because a great deal of their employees had fallen sick with coughing and fever.\n\n \n\n\"We might need to fly our pegasi and hope it's quick enough,\"\n\n \n\nPercy suggested, frustration evident in her voice. She looked at Marble, Cream and Foam perched on a rooftop nearby and mentally apologized to their mounts. They would likely need to exhaust the poor pegasi to get there in time. The mounts nodded back at her and Percy smiled apologetically at them before turning to her son and Lee.\n\n \n\n\"Let's grab something to eat first,\"Will said, his stomach growling. Percy moved close to him and put her arm around his shoulders, drawing him close. They found a nearby burger place and took a seat. Will and Lee must have been quite hungry because neither objected to the unhealthy menu. A young, blonde and perky looking waitress approached them, eyeing them suspiciously.\n\n \n\n\"Can you pay for your meals?\" she asked, her tone skeptical.\n\n \n\nPercy reassured her, holding up the credit card ring Apollo had given her and smiling. It was not the first time they were asked this question, but showing them the ring always worked. Contrary to Percy's expectations, the waitress just narrowed her eyes, disbelief evident in her posture.\n\n \n\n\"We can pay, don't worry.\" Percy tried to sound as sincere as possible.\n\n \n\nThe waitress still seemed doubtful, making Percy wonder if she could see through the Mist. At that moment, a bike roared into view, and a tall man in a leather jacket entered the diner. All the mortals inside jumped to their feet, nodding at the man and only sitting down again when he made a dismissive gesture. It reminded Percy of both Amyclas which made her heart twist with longing and nostalgia. And of Minos, which made her fists curl up. It was how everyone reacted when both kings entered a room. In Amyclas case it was due to well earned respect, but with Minos it was just fear.\n\n \n\nPercy recognized the god approaching them immediately. The aura of bloodlust and rage was very distinctive. Percy could almost smell the bloodsoaked battlefields and hear the war cries of warriors. She shook her head, collecting herself. It was never wise to be swept up in battlerage.\n\n \n\n\"Ares,\" she whispered, her heart racing.\n\n \n\nThe god of war, divine patron of Sparta, stopped by their table and looked at the waitress. He lowered his dark shades, uncovering eyes like burning coals.\n\n \n\n\"I'll cover their meal.\" He told her, his tone brokering no argument.\n\n \n\nThe waitress swallowed and her eyes widened, she seemed reluctant to leave and she glanced at Percy, Will and Lee. Her eyes especially lingered on Will, the youngest. Ares scowled at the waitress who bolted immediately. Percy noticed the waitress surreptitiously taking a picture of Ares on her phone. Now Percy was even more convinced that their waitress could see through the mist. If the waitress could do that, then she definitely knew who Percy was, but she had made no move to call the police on Percy or even take a picture of her. Then again, Percy recalled that she was a twelve year old girl. No one with a brain cell would believe that a twelve year old girl would be involved in the disappearance of her own mother or be a terrorist. Percy wondered about the modern masses sometimes. Maybe it was something in the water.\n\n \n\nAres sat down, crowding Lee towards the window. Lee's eyes flashed with rage as he was affected by Ares' aura. Percy also struggled to control herself, but the comportment lessons she had received as Hyacinthus and Icarus helped her. She kicked Lee under the table, trying to get him to focus past Ares' aura of rage and conflict. The son of Apollo locked his eyes with her and took a deep breath.\n\n \n\n\"Easy, Lee,\" she murmured, her voice steady.\n\n \n\n\"We need to stay calm.\"\n\n \n\nAres smirked, clearly enjoying the tension.\n\n \n\n\"So, what brings you three to Denver?\" he asked, his tone mocking.\n\n \n\nPercy took a deep breath, forcing a smile. If Ares did not know why they were in Denver then Percy would eat an olive fresh off the branch. It was very, very suspicious that the god of war would show up. Percy already suspected that one of the war deities or Eris had caused this mess. Ares just made himself the prime suspect by showing up. Percy would need to be very careful and not convey her suspicions.\n\n \n\nMedusa had told them that one of the gods sent to find the bolt had found it and then decided to keep it instead of returning it to Zeus. As much as Percy would have liked to dismiss Medusa's words as lies, Ares' presence in their quest gave them credibility. And the god that would profit the most from a divine war would be Ares, his sister Enyo and his twin sons. Eris would too, but Ares was the one here.\n\n \n\n\"Just passing through,\" she replied, her eyes meeting Ares' with determination.\n\n \n\n\"On a quest. As I am sure you already know, Lord Ares.\"\n\n \n\nAres leaned back, his smirk widening.\n\n \n\n\"Well, good luck with that. You'll need it. When the bolt was first stolen, Zeus sent his best to find it. Me, Athena, Apollo and Artemis. If I could not sniff out a weapon that powerful then what chance do three little demigods have?\"\n\n \n\nPercy looked at him, resisting the urge to snap at Ares.\n\n \n\n\"We got a prophecy from the Pythia and she told us that we would find the Bolt. Besides, there are places where gods can't go but demigods can.\"\n\n \n\n\"The Underworld for example,\" Lee spoke.\n\n \n\n\"Percy went there while alive as Hyacinthus to do a task that a god could not do.\" Lee was doing an admirable job fighting down the rage, despite not having court training.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus, Crown Prince of Sparta, back to life again.\" Ares looked at Percy.\n\n \n\nAres leaned back, reminiscing.\n\n \n\n\"Sparta, my patron city. Apollo had good taste to fall for a Spartan prince.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, remembering her past lives.\n\n \n\n\"I arranged for one of my daughters to marry your first father, King Amyclas. But she incurred Hera's wrath and was erased from all records. She shamed Sparta almost as much as Helen did, but at least with her you were able to keep things under wraps.\"\n\n \n\nWhat a pity that Hera had not taken similar umbrage to Leda and her children by Zeus. Instead Hera stayed her hand and Helen stole Asclepius' inheritance. Helen did not even have the decency to be grateful to be unfairly and unrightfully given Sparta but went and ran off to Troy with the first womanizer to show up and woo her.\n\n \n\nAres scowled slightly, definitely not liking recalling Aristodamia. Percy wondered if he knew that happened with little Daphne. Hyacinthus had not been able to risk looking into the little girl, out of fear of reminding Amyclas of the child's existence and of his shame but had always wondered.\n\n \n\n\"You're the only mortal who remembers her. But I'm not here to reminisce. I know you're having trouble finding transportation west. I can help, for a favor.\"\n\n \n\nPercy realized why no car rental would deal with them. Ares would ensure that they were unable to go further unless he got what he wanted.\n\n \n\n\"What favor?\"\n\n \n\n\"I planned a date with Aphrodite at Waterland in Thornton. I forgot my shield there, but Hephaestus discovered the place. I need you to retrieve it.\"\n\n \n\nPercy looked at Lee, then back at Ares.\n\n \n\n\"We'll do it. We need to get west as soon as possible. Our deadline is the summer solstice, June 21st, and it's already June 13th.\"\n\n \n\nAres grinned, visibly pleased to have gotten his way. As soon as he was gone, Percy would pray to Apollo, Artemis and her father to let them know of her suspicions. They would investigate from their end.\n\n \n\n\"Good. Retrieve my shield, and I'll ensure you have transportation to Vegas.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, grimly determined.\n\n \n\n\"Let's get this done.\"\n\n \n\nWhen Ares left, Percy closed her eyes and began praying silently. She knew that it worked because the sun shone brighter, and Percy could feel Apollo's anger. The water in their glasses also swished threateningly and it was not her doing it. There was no sign from Artemis other than a feeling of ease after the prayer. Reassured that her beloved, her mother figure and father were now aware of Ares' suspicious behavior and Medusa's information, Percy breathed out in relief.\n\n \n\n~~~~~~~\n\n \n\nPercy soared through the skies on her Pegasus, Marble. Beside her, her son Will rode Cream, and Lee Fletcher flew on Foam. Their mission was still the same to find Zeus' lightning bolt. But first, they had a side quest assigned by Ares--to retrieve his shield from Waterland in Thornton in exchange for transportation to Vegas.\n\n \n\nAs they landed at Waterland, Percy couldn't hide her disgust. The place was a rundown mess. It was obvious from the sign itself. Once it had proudly declared WATERLAND but now three of the letters had fallen off, reading only WAT R A D.The main entrance was locked and equipped with barbed wire. Inside, Percy could see huge dry waterslides and tubes and pipes twisting everywhere, leading to empty pools. Shame, in its heyday it would have been fun. Percy definitely would have loved coming here as a kid. But now, due to neglect the place was just sad and even somewhat eerie.\n\n \n\n\"Seriously? Ares took Aphrodite of all goddesses here for a date?\" Percy exclaimed, her eyes wide with disbelief and a bit of fear. Aphrodite would not be happy about this, and when she was unhappy disasters happened.\n\n \n\nLee looked around, equally appalled. His astonishment was reassuring about the quality of young men, even if Percy knew that Lee was an exception rather than the rule.\n\n \n\n\"Do you think Aphrodite saw the place and left?\"\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head. She herself would be very insulted and furious if Apollo chose a place like this for a date, she shuddered to imagine what Aphrodite's reaction would be. Apocalyptic rage most likely.\n\n \n\n\"Unlikely. If Aphrodite had seen this huge insult, Waterland would be a crater emitting rose pink smoke.\"\n\n \n\nLee chuckled as he shook his head in disbelief.\n\n \n\n\"Do all male gods have such horrible taste in date locations?\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled and shook her head.\n\n \n\n\"My experience is limited to your father, Apollo. He took Hyacinthus and Icarus to very lovely places for dates. As Hyacinthus, I was friends with Crocus, the lover of Hermes. Hermes also took Crocus to beautiful places. Dionysus likely does the same for Ariadne or she would not have married him. It's just Ares who has appalling taste.\"\n\n \n\nLee laughed.\"Ares better have a plan to get back in Aphrodite's good graces. Once she finds out, and she will because Pheme is always out for a new story for Olympus Weekly, Aphrodite will be furious.\"\n\n \n\nThey urged their Pegasi over the main gate and approached the entrance of Waterland, ready to face whatever Hephaestus had left behind for his faithless wife and brother. Lee put on the flying shoes from Luke, and Percy eyed them with unease. She hoped that Hermes would not be insulted. They flew around the park, looking at the various attractions. Percy was amused to see Ankle Biter Island, likely meant for very young children. Head Over Wedgie, a fairly intense waterslide and Dude, Where's My Swimsuit? The last one was not for the faint of heart. Percy kept a sharp eye for possible monsters but there were none. It was absolutely silent, even the breeze stood still.\n\n \n\nAres had told them to check the Tunnel of Love. Percy rolled her eyes at the blatant double entendre, a long time ago Apollo had complained about Ares' vulgarity. In that regard, the war god was the same. Percy wondered what Hephaestus had set up for his wife and brother this time. The Golden Net was a classic, but how many times could Aphrodite and Ares fall for the same old trick?\n\n \n\nPercy, Will and Lee stopped in front of an empty pool shaped like a bowl about fifty meters. Around the pool, Percy could see about a dozen statues of Eros with their wings spread and ready to fire their bows. Percy's jaw dropped. Did Ares intend to have a date with his lover while surrounded by statues of their son? Percy was aware that gods had very different boundaries from mortals. She knew that well, in her previous lives Apollo tended to drape himself on Hyacinthus and Icarus with no care of who was watching, be it Amyclas or Daedalus. But this was way too much. Percy almost felt sorry for Eros, gods could see through statues and paintings of themselves and in a way this could be considered a sacred space for the love gods. She recalled that one of the Erotes, Anteros, was her half-brother and grimaced.\n\nPercy looked away from the statues and caught Lee's eyes, who looked just as disgusted as she did, also having caught the implications. Will, bless his innocent little heart just pointed to the opposite side where they could see a tunnel where the water would have flowed if the pool were full. It had a sign above, THRILL RIDE O' LOVE: THIS IS NOT YOUR PARENT'S TUNNEL OF LOVE!\n\n \n\nPercy was getting a feeling that Ares was angry at Eros for some reason or another because that sign, coupled with the statues was way on the nose. A rather cruel taunt in her opinion. As much as she disliked Eros for sheltering that god from Apollo's rage she definitely would not wish upon him having to watch his own parents get busy. Then again, knowing what Eros was like, he might not mind at all. All gods were weird by mortal standards, love gods even more so.\n\n \n\n\"Mom, Lee, look!\" Will pointed to a pink and white two-seater boat embellished with a canopy with hearts. In the left seat, glinting almost ominously was Ares' shield, a very polished circle of the finest celestial bronze. Nearly all temples of Ares that Hyacinthus and Icarus had visited had statues of Ares clutching a similar shield. Icarus had helped Daedalus construct one such shield for the temple Alastor was head priest in. Even that one, crafted by Daedalus himself was not match for the real one, made by Hephaestus, likely before he caught his brother with his wife for the first time.\n\n \n\nPercy's eyes caught the letter Eta carved at the base of one of then Eros statues. She pointed it at Lee. It is a Hephaestus' symbol. She had seen it on the giant automaton Talos before the Argonauts had destroyed it in her second life. It even was on the bow Artemis had gifted her.\n\n \n\n\"Will, stay back and ready your bow. Lee, on the air, ready your bow too. I will go down to get it.\"\n\n \n\nThankfully, neither boy argued with her. Percy transformed her ring into a trident, while she was much better with a sword, a weapon she could control with her mind would be more useful in this situation. She carefully descended and reached the boat. The shield was propped on one seat, and next to it was a pink silk scarf which emitted an enticing scent. Percy had to pinch herself not to get distracted by the honeyed scent of sunshine that was distinctively Apollo. Smilax had mentioned this once, Aphrodite was in the habit of enchanting her scarves to entice mortals and gods alike. Aphrodite had even gifted one to Smilax, but she had kept it locked in a box. Smilax had enough trouble with unwanted suitors to make herself even more desirable with artificial means.Percy noticed something she had not been able to spot earlier. The rim of the pool was embossed with mirrors, all facing the boat. Her eyes narrowed, the mirrors were too clean and intact to have been part of the original fixtures. Percy picked up the scarf and stuffed it in a pocket. Then Percy slowly reached for the shield. She brushed against a cobweb connecting the shield to something. Percy grasped hold of it and realized that it was a very, very fine metal filament, so fine that it was almost invisible to the naked eye.\n\n \n\n\"Crap!\" Percy spoke, recognizing the signature of a Hephaestus trap.\n\n \n\nShe heard noise, a multitude of gears running and the whole pool turned into one giant machine and Percy was right in the middle.\n\n \n\nWill screamed, \"Mom!\"\n\n \n\nOn the rim of the pool the statues of Eros were drawing their bows ready to fire. Percy raised the shield to cover herself but when the Eros statues shot, they shot at each other, not her. Silky cables trailed from the arrows, intercrossing and forming a very large gold asterisk. Then smaller metallic threads started weaving from the laster strands and forming a net. Percy mentally swung the trident all around to disrupt as much as she could, she brandished Riptide and fought her way out of the pool, using both sword and shield. The shield was very easy to use, feeling all too eager to take part in a fight. Percy would definitely see if she could commission a similar design from Beckendorf, the best metalsmith in camp. Will and Lee shot down as many of the threads as they could.\n\n \n\nThe heads of the Eroses opened and out came video cameras. Spotlights emerged all around the pool, nearly blinding Percy, who quickly narrowed her eyes to reduce the assault on her vision. Then a loudspeaker nearly deafened her.\n\n \n\n\"Live to Olympus in one minute . . . Fifty-nine seconds, fifty-eight . . .\"\n\n \n\nDefinitely Hephaestus. Percy focused on making her way out, she almost made it out when the mirror panels opened and released thousands of metallic spiders. Percy raised an eyebrow. Was Hephaestus expecting a child of Athena? Even as Icarus she had never been afraid of spiders. Percy kicked and stomped at the silly things, wishing that there was water around so she could just sweep them away. The thought gave her pause and Percy focused on sensing if there was water, this was called WATERLAND after all. She closed her eyes and called water to her.\n\n \n\nWater answered her call and exploded from the pipes, Percy being careful to maneuver it around Will and Lee. She used it to sweep the spiders away and hoist herself up and towards the opening in the net.\n\n \n\nThe loudspeaker had long stopped counting, Percy scowled at the camera, knowing that it was live on Olympus. Percy deliberately walked on water while glaring at the camera. She willed a few sprouts of water to shred the net. The water readily responded to her irritation and the golden threads unraveled and snapped. When she reached the rim she looked at the camera.\n\n \n\n\"Are you entertained?!\"\n\n \n\nShe called out before sending multiple jets of water to small all the cameras except one, the one closest to her. That one, she just reached and turned off before detaching it from the Eros head. She closed her eyes and started praying to Hephaestus. She conveyed to him her suspicions about Ares and asked for permission to borrow the camera. She felt the camera in her hand warm up briefly and took it as approval. Percy quickly put the camera in her bag, hiding the action even from Will and Lee.\n\n \n\nWill immediately ran to hug her fiercely. Percy rubbed his back and kissed his curls. They then hurried out. The shield needed to be returned to Ares. Percy at least knew that the god of war would be catching a lot of flak from Aphrodite about this. She smiled at that thought as she followed Lee out, after the boy removed those suspicious shoes at her insistence.\n\nJust realized that have not shown Percy have demigod dreams. Will need to rectify that in later chapters.\n\nAres keeps his end of the bargain. Percy, Will and Lee get a room at a certain hotel. Guess who is inside?\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nPercy, Will and Lee flew back to the dinner parking lot where Ares was waiting for them. The god of war was laughing at something in his phone. He noticed the demigods approaching and held up a finger indicating them to wait. Percy's s fingers tightened on the straps of Ares' shield, just about done with him. It had been the second king of Laconia, Myles, the son of Lelex who had decided to make Ares the kingdom's patron god. Right now Percy really wished that her ancestor had chosen another god.\n\n\"I am starting a war on twitter.\" Ares laughed at his phone.\n\nCurious despite herself, Percy fished the cellphone that Galaxaura had provided her with. Beckendorf from the Hephaestus cabin told her that it was one of the smith god's designs and it was expensive. Every demigod wanted one but pretty much only Silena, Drew and a few others with rich mortal parents could afford them. Percy opened her twitter app just to see if whatever the lunatic god was doing was trending.\n\n\"Twitter has crashed.\" She told Ares.\n\nAres looked at her phone.\n\n\"Apollo got you one of the ugly cripple's designs already?\"\n\nPercy did not answer, she just held out the shield.\n\n\"I believe that you mentioned transportation?\"\n\nAres took the shield.\n\n\"The cripple must have been so surprised when he got three kids instead of me and my girl.\"\n\n\"I doubt that a god as old as your brother is capable of being surprised anymore. But I am sure he was disappointed that his trap did not let him his wife and her lover.\" Percy bared her teeth in the parody of a smile.\n\nAres' smirk fell slightly from the reminder that his girlfriend was someone else's wife.\n\n\"Vegas. Wonderful city. Artemis hates it but the gods have a chariot racing track there. Today, my horses are being transported there. You and your flying ponies can catch a ride with them.\"\n\nPercy looked to where the god was pointing. She saw a huge blood red truck reading WAR HORSES INTERNATIONAL . Percy raised her eyebrows.\n\n\"Chariot races? In this day and age!\" She could not help but ask in wonder. Memories rushed through her mind. Hyacinthus on his chariot, urging his horses further and further, doing seven laps around the circus, winning more often than not. The only times Hyacinthus had lost was when racing against Apollo and a few times against Crocus.\n\nAres grinned.\n\n\"Yes. Just like old times. Demigods used to be invited but in the last five hundred years they started using dirty tactics during the races so we stopped inviting them because a lot of them used dirty tactics.\"\n\nPercy recoiled.\n\n\"Dirty tactics? In chariot racing?\"\n\nShe looked toward Lee who looked sheepishly embarrassed.\n\n\"We have not had one at camp since forever but you know, our cabin shoots the drivers, the Hephaestus cabin throws greek fire misiles and such.\"\n\nPercy's jaw dropped and she looked at Ares, silently begging him to correct Lee.\n\n\"He is serious isnt he?\"\n\nAres sneered.\n\n\"The sun spawn is correct. Takes so much fun out of the races, knowing that no one can actually die.\"\n\nPercy grimaced.\n\n\"Lee, chariot races are supposed to be clean affairs, only showcing riding skills. Cheating would have gotten you executed back in the old times if not lynched right there on the spot.\"\n\nAres nodded, looking vaguely nostalgic.\n\n\"Fun times\"\n\n\"Hop on kids.\" He pointed to the truck.\n\nThe driver was definitely a satyr, but much older and sterner than Grover.\n\nAres extended a bag to Percy.\n\n\"This will keep you supplied with food and weapons.\"\n\nPercy reluctantly took the bag, just nodding, choosing not to speak. Ares was looking more and more suspicious.\n\nThey boarded the truck, it was rather bigger in the inside, as large as the royal stables in Sparta. The design was similar too. Percy looked at the horses. There were a few undead skeletal ones but most of them were regular racing and war horses. They all greeted her when she came in. One of the satyrs took charge of Marble, Cream and Foam and another showed Percy, Will and Lee to a place where they could sit down. It was a simple bench near one of the empty padlocks. Their pegasi went in. The demigods sat and Percy opened Ares' bag to see what was inside. She could see two packs of Oreos, a large bottle of water, and a couple of daggers. She grimaced as she took out the water and one of the Oreo packs. Will and Lee were not enthused to see the sugary snack but each of them took one. Under their gimlet stares Percy did not dare eat more than one. Lee produced some fruit from his own backpack and they started snacking on that. Marble moved closer to them and pilfered the Oreos, which he happily shared with Cream and Foam. Percy listened them compliment the cookies with slight jealously.\n\nPercy looked out of one of the windows before the truck started and she saw the waitress clutching a cellphone while talking to an older man. The man's posture was dismissive but the waitress was gesticulating wildly. Finally the man seemed to give up and the waitress looked briefly triumphant before the two got into a car and speed off. Percy went back to the bench and Will leaned against her, she hugged her son and the gentle murmurings of the horses and the movement of the truck lulled her to sleep.\n\nShe had barely dozed off when she was rudely startled awake by the truck coming to a screeching halt.\n\n\"Kid, I forgot to tell you one thing,\" Ares told her as she blinked awake, clutching an equally startled Will. On her other side, Lee bristled and Percy pinched him on his forearm to warn him.\n\n\"I have information about your mother.\" The war god told her.\n\n\"What information!\" Percy gasped. Had Hades placed her mother in the Fields of Punishment? It could not be. Her mother was too good a person and Hades had always been honorable and fair.\n\n\"Your mother is not dead.\" Ares smirked.\n\nPercy felt the ground tremble and realised that she was the one doing it. The satyrs nearby bleated in unease and she collected herself, stoping the tremors.\n\"What do you mean. I saw her...\"\n\n\"Disapear in a flash of light when the Minotaur touched her?\" Ares continued for her.\n\n\"That's metamorphosis. Not death. She is being kept. Then again you were a corpse both times you were transformed.\"\n\n\"Kept. By Hades. As a hostage. Which one does Hades want to control, me or my father?\"\n\nAres raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"At least you have not forgotten what you were taught in Sparta. Poseidon can't be controlled. Many have tried, including my father and they have failed.\" He laughed.\n\nSo Hades definitely thought that Percy had stolen his helm and likely wanted to use Percy's mother to get it back. Unfortunately for him, Percy was not the thief and she had no idea where the Helm of Darkness was.\n\n\"Not asking why Hades would want to control you?\" Ares taunted, clearly enjoying her discomfort.\n\nPercy bared her teeth at the god of war.\n\n\"Maybe it has something to do with that prophecy?\" She taunted him right back.\n\nAres flinched slightly, something flickering behind his burning eyes.\n\n\"I am done here,\" He said.\n\n\"See you around, kid.\"\n\nHe jumped of the truck and, climbed on his Harley and roared off. Percy hoped that she would not meet him anytime soon. Preferably never again. She had no idea what her ancestor had thought when making him the patron god of her kingdom.\n\n\"Let's go back to sleep,\" She told Will.\n\n\"Shouldn't we discus what he said about grandma?\" Will asked her.\n\n\"There is nothing we can do about her right now Will. She is hopefully still alive. We can only hope that Hades is treating her well. Gods willing we will reach the Underworld soon. But until we get there, there is nothing we can do.\"\n\nWill wilted a bit and cuddled up closer to her, Percy wrapped her arms around him.\n\n\"It's getting late,\" Lee spoke.\n\n\"Lets get some rest.\"\n\nPercy slept fitfully. The demigod dreams that had plagued her in her first life coming back with a vengeance.\n\nHer nightmare started fairly normal. She was running away from something too fast, chasing her too closely. Then the dream changed. Percy found herself shackled to a chair with a girl also shackled to another chair next to her. Ominous wings howled around them. The girl was of similar age to Percy, with uncombed black hair in a very punkish hairstyle that would have given Galaxaura the fits. Her eyes were heavily lined with black kohl, her skin was rather pale and she had freckles on her nose. Her eyes were electric blue, just like the hateful eyes of Minos that Icarus saw almost daily. Or the eyes of Heracles, which he thankfully saw on one unpleasant occasion.\n\nThe girl struggled against the shackles, glared at Percy, reinforcing her resemblance to Minos and unwittingly raising Percy's hackles.\n\nWell, Sea spawn? One of us has to get out of here.\n\nPercy realised who the other girl was. She was Thalia Grace, the daughter of Zeus, lately a pine tree.\n\nPercy realised that Thalia was right, she had to go into the cavern that she saw. Maybe it would give Percy the clues to find out who was behind this.\n\nThe shackles shattered. Percy fell through the stony floor. The howling wind became a voice, cold, ancient and evil, echoing from the depths of the pit itself.\n\nPercy Jackson, the voice said. Yes, that was an inspired idea.\n\nPercy realised that the voice was not addressing her. The terrifying power of that voice was directed at someone else. Not the girl that Percy had left shackled earlier, but someone else.\n\nAnd she suspect nothing? The voice wanted to know.\n\nAnother voice, one that seemed almost familiar to Percy, one that she was certain she had definitely heard before and recently at that answered.\n\nNothing, my lord. The other voice answered, making Percy narrow her eyes. The only beings who got called my lord nowadays were gods and maybe titans.\n\nShe is as ignorant as the rest, no matter her past lives. She is distracted at having been made a mother at such a young age.\n\nPercy tried to look toward the voice but she could see no one. Whoever the speaker was, they were invisible to her.\n\nDeception upon deception, the dark thing from the pit said.\nExcellent.\n\nTruly, my lord said the other voice, you are well-named the Crooked one. But was it really necessary? I could have brought you what I stole directly -\n\nYou? The thing sneered. You have already shown your limits. You would have failed me completely had I not intervened.\n\nBut, my lord -\n\nPeace, little servant. Our six months have bought us much. Zeus' anger has grown. Poseidon has played his most desperate card. Now we shall use it against him. Shortly you shall have the reward you wish, and your revenge. As soon as both items are delivered into my hands.... But wait. She is here!\n\nWhat? The invisible servant shouted, sounding panicked.\n\nYou summoned her, my lord?\n\nNo. Percy found herself the the target of the creature's full focus. She tried to back away but found herself paralyzed as she struggled to wiggle free.\n\nBlast her father's blood -- she is too changeable, too unpredictable. The girl brought herself hither.\n\nImpossible! The servant called out in shock.\n\nFor a weakling such as you, perhaps, the monster cruelly stated before focusing on Percy again.\n\nSo ... you wish to dream of your quest, little reborn half-blood? Then I shall oblige.\n\nPercy's surroundings changed.\n\nShe found herself in an immense throne room with dramatic black marble walls and celestial bronze floors. In font of her was a ghastly throne made from human bones fused together. Standing near it was her mother. She was frozen in golden light, her arms held out.\n\nPercy tried to reach her mother but her legs would not obey her. Percy tried to reach out but saw that her hands were withering to the bones. Laughing skeletons in ancient armour surrounded her. They draped percy with silk robes, placing a laurel crown on her head. A laurel crown that festered with Chimera poison, burning her.\n\nThe voice began to chant and laugh.\n\nHail, the conquering hero! The reborn prince!\n\nAll Percy, former child of a muse could thing off was that it was a rather pathetic attempt at drama. She shook of the laurel crown and kicked at the skeletons.\n\nShe woke up, one of the satyrs eyeing her curiously and with a bit of trepidation.\n\n\"Did I bother you?\" Percy asked the satyr.\n\nThe satyr shook his head.\n\n\"No, I was worried about you. Seemed like an intense nightmare.\"\n\nPercy chuckled.\n\n\"Not really, just confusing.\"\n\nThe satyr nodded at her and left to check on a neighting horse. Percy looked at Will, drooling with his head on her lap and Lee, sprawled over the bench. In her dream the servant had called the mastermind the Crooked One, one of the names for Kronos. Percy really, really hoped that she was wrong but demigod dreams rarely were. She closed her eyes and started to pray to Artemis. It was night and her foster mother would be at her strongest. Poseidon was not an option, Kronos had devoured him, she could not alarm him on just a dream. Percy felt the moonlight on her. Artemis' moonlight was a lot more inscrutable than Apollo's sunlight but Percy had a feeling that Artemis felt sceptical but was a venue she was willing to consider.\n\nThe ride from Denver to Vegas took almost twelve hours, an excellent time given the size of the truck and how much cargo it had. It was fairly late in the afternoon when they arrived at the racetrack that the gods used in Vegas. The stumbled out of the truck after saying their thanks to the satyrs. It was extremely hot and Lee had to use the mist to prevent people from paying to much attention to Percy.\n\n\"We need to find a place to sleep and then a ride to LA.\" Percy spoke.\n\nOne of the satyrs pointed to a large hotel. Percy read the sign. Lotus Hotel and Casino. Something niggled her memory. The entrance was a huge pink lotus flower, the petals lighing up at intervals. There was no one going in or coming out but the sparkling doors were open, emiting fresh and florally scented air. Percy recognized the lotus blooms from her past lives. Queen Pasiphae had been fond of their perfume and even Ariadne had worn it a lot. As Hyacinthus, his baths were often scented with it.\n\nThe doorman waved at them. Percy looked at the satyr.\n\n\"It is part of the Olympus crowd,\" he told her.\n\n\"Monster free. No one bats an eyelash at demigod shenanigans.\"\n\nThat was good enough for Percy, Will and Lee. They headed to the door whee the doorman welcomed them warmly and eagerly.\n\n\"Hello children! You look exhausted. Would you like to come in and sit down? We have some lovely lemonade!\"\n\nPercy smiled back as they walked in. She looked at the interior and waas astonished. The entire lobby was an enormous arcade. There was an indoor waterslide twisting around the glass elevator, which went quite up. She spied a climbing wall and an indoor bungee-jumping bridge. Percy raised her eyebrows. This place had to have some serious godly workings on it. No mortal could build such a place. Lee was looking at the virtual-reality suits with working laser guns. Will was curiously peering at the infinity of video games, each one with its own widescreen TV.\n\nYet, despite all the amenities the place did not feel crowded, so definitely some sort of spatial distortion. Shame no one had thought to use it on the Hermes cabin with its crowding problem.\n\nA bellhop approached the three questers and handed them keys to a suite. Percy as confused, she had not been in any hotels but she did know that payment had to happen first.\n\n\"Don't worry!\" The bellhop laughed. \"The bill has been taken care off. No extra charges, no tips. Just go up to the top floor, the number is 4001.\"\n\nPercy chalked it up to Apollo arranging this. He had done this before. When he had to leave Hyacinthus in Delphi and had set up his Delphic palace for him, or when he had ordered his priests in Knossos to attend to every whim of Icarus. She took the key and the LotusCash cards that the bellhop handed out.\n\n\"Lets go and take a shower, and then have some food.\" Lee spoke, taking his card.\n\n \n\nThe room they were assigned was practically divine. The beds were silk duvets and goosedown mattress and pillows. The bathrooms could double as spas. The minibar could have fed an entire royal court. Percy smiled and mentally thanked Apollo. It was very sweet of him to arrange this. Will and Lee were definitely having a blast of a time.\n\nThe trio headed to one of the restaurants for dinner, hoping to find a table near the enormous fish tank.\n\nAs they approached the tank, Will's eyes lit up.\n\"Mom, look at the betta fish and the neon tetras! They're so colorful!\" he exclaimed, pressing his face against the glass.\n\n \n\nPercy smiled, watching her son gush over the fish.\n\n \n\n\"They are beautiful, aren't they?\" she said, her eyes following a particularly vibrant betta fish.\n\n \n\n\"But how are they keeping so many male bettas calm in the same tank? They're usually so aggressive and territorial.\"\n\n \n\nLee, always the practical one, shrugged.\n\n \n\n\"This place is likely magic,\" he said. \"Godly places aren't exactly known for following the rules of nature.\"\n\n \n\nJust then, a pair of siblings approached their table. Percy noticed the way they moved, that inherent deadly and borderline inhuman grace that all demigods shared. The younger of them, the boy, acutely reminded her of someone, making her heart twist in unknown nostalgia. Who was this boy, and what was he to Percy?\n\n \n\n\"Hi, I'm Nico, and this is my sister, Bianca,\" the boy said. Percy barely hid her startled reaction to the boy's name. Nico. She recalled a solemn, brave and heroic demigod she had been good friends with thousands of years ago. Little Nico had the exact same obsidian black eyes. The smile was different. Nicodemos had gone through too much to smile with such careless happiness. The ancient son of Hades had rarely smiled and when he did smile it was small, quick as if he did not dare to allow himself joy.\n\n \n\n\"We usually dine at this table. Do you mind if we join you?\"\n\n \n\nPercy, Will, and Lee exchanged glances and smiled.\n\n \n\n\"Of course, you can join us,\" Percy said warmly. Good manners cost nothing after all and she could not bring herself to be harsh with this modern day doppleganger of her long lost friend.\n\n \n\nAs they settled in, Nico and Will immediately hit it off, chatting animatedly about their favorite fish. No surprise, since they were small children, it was the colorful and rambunctious betta fish. Lee went to the buffet and returned with plates of delicious but healthy food for everyone. Percy noticed that it was Italian recipes, really old ones, almost Roman in fact. She shrugged, it looked good, so she set aside her distaste for the Roman Empire.\n\n \n\nWhile they ate, Nico and Will started playing Mythomagic, a game they both loved. Percy watched them with a smile, glad to see her son socialize with someone his age and have fun. She occasionally glanced at Nico and Lee noticed.\n\n \n\n\"You realised that they are like us too?\" Lee whispered to her.\n\n \n\nPercy nodded at him as she dipped a cut of beef into the garum infused sauce. She turned to Bianca who was eating gustily as she watched her brother play. There was a strange expression on her face. Percy decided to engage the other girl in conversation.\n\n \n\n\"So, how long have you been staying here?\" she asked Bianca with a smile.\nBianca daintly set down her utensils and used her napkin to dab at her mouth before speaking.\n\n \n\n\"We have been lodging at this establishment for a few fortnights now. Our mama and papa passed away recently, and our papa's solicitor brought us here for safekeeping while the estate is determined upon.\"\n\n \n\nPercy noticed Bianca's old-fashioned turns of phrase and antiquated mannerisms. Something felt off.\n\n \n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Percy said gently. \"It's been a crazy time in America lately, especially with Donald Trump as president. I can't believe that people were foolish enough to elect him!\"\n\n \n\nBianca looked confused.\n\n \n\n\"Donald Trump? Who's that? I thought Franklin D. Roosevelt was the president.\"\nPercy almost choked on her drink.\n\n \n\n\"Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945,\" she said, her eyes widening. \"Bianca, what year do you think it is?\"\n\n \n\nBianca's face paled.\n\n \n\n\"1945,\" she whispered.\n\n \n\nPercy felt a chill run down her spine. Something was definitely not right.\n\n \n\nShe looked around the restaurant and noticed many people in clothes decidedly not modern. One lady wore a crinolined gown, and a couple of men were dressed in Roman togas. At their table, there were small bowls filled with garum, a Roman fish sauce. Percy, a reincarnated soul, had no trouble with it, but Will and Lee avoided it, having a modern aversion to such food items. Even Nico and Bianca had not touched it.\n\n \n\nSomething was definitely not right.\n\nChanged things a bit. Ares knows that Percy is being watched and if he sent the love of Apollo's life on Unkindness International he would end up getting shot with flaming arrows everytime Apollo spotted him from the sun chariot as a certain Wind god. So Percy and the other two got a nice ride to Vegas this time. That Satyr has a huge grudge against Apollo so he deliberately sent them to Lotus Hotel.\n\nDecided to keep the dream convo that Percy spied on more or less the same.\n\nThe Trio hurry to LA.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nIt took Percy a great deal of effort to convince Lee that the building they were in was extremely dangerous and they had to leave immediately. Lee kept getting distracted and forgetting what Percy told him. Percy was uncertain of her immunity. It might be due to her having broken the effects of the Lethe or it might be the ring that Apollo gave her. He did say that it would enable him to monitor her health.\n\nPercy grabbed Lee with one arm and Will with the other and marched them out. She tried to call out to Bianca and Nico but the two other children got immediately distracted. Percy looked at them with sadness and regret but she could not let go of either Will or Lee to grab them.\n\nPercy stood in the dazzling lobby of the Lotus Hotel and Casino, her heart pounding. She had just realized the truth: the hotel was a trap designed to keep them forever. Grabbing her son Will and his Lee by the wrists, she marched them towards the exit.\n\n\"Don't let go of my hands,\" she warned them.\n\n \n\n\"If you do, you'll forget everything I just told you about this place.\"\n\n \n\nWill and Lee nodded, their eyes wide with fear and confusion. Percy glanced back, her heart aching as she saw Nico and Bianca Di Angelo still entranced by the hotel's allure. She couldn't reach them in time. Will also looked back and Nico, his eyes shining with sadness.\n\n \n\n\"I am sorry Will, but we can't. We need to get to LA to find the bolt or it will be war.\" Percy consoled him and Will sighed with sadness, looking at Nico who was engrosed with one of the games further back in the lobby.\n\n \n\nAs they neared the entrance, Percy felt a pulse in her finger. The credit card ring Apollo had given her was vibrating, a sign that he was monitoring her health and likely trying to warn her about the danger they were in. She tightened her grip on Will and Lee, determined to get them out safely.\n\n \n\nThe concierge, a tall man with a sad smile, approached them.\n\n \n\n\"Are you sure you want to leave? We have so much more to offer.\"\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head.\n\n \n\n\"We're on a timed mission. We need to leave now.\"\n\n\n \n\nThe concierge's eyes watered, but he stepped aside, allowing them to pass. He did bid them a tearful goodbye and told them that they were welcome to come back at anytime. Percy, Will, and Lee stepped out into the bright sunlight, free from the hotel's grasp. But Percy's heart was heavy, knowing that Nico and Bianca were still trapped inside. She did not know if she would ever be able to go back for them, if she would be able to fight the effects of the hotel again.\n\n \n\nOutside, they saw the God's Chariot racing track. At the entrance, the satyrs who had accompanied them from Denver to Vegas were waiting nervously, except for the one who had directed them toward the Lotus Hotel. One of the remaining satyrs approached Percy, looking apologetic.\n\n \n\n\"We had no idea what our friend did. I swear to you that we have nothing to do with it. Only he could be so foolish,\" he said.\n\n \n\n\"Where is he?\" Percy asked, her voice tense as she kept hold of Will to avoid her son rushing back into the Lotus Hotel.\n\n \n\n\"Lord Apollo flashed in, grabbed him while he was screaming and trying to run away, and then Lord Apollo left after there was a sound of thunder,\" the satyr explained.\n\n \n\nPercy and Lee exchanged a glance. Knowing what likely awaited the satyr. Will thankfully did not seem to realise it and was just looking back at the Lotus Hotel, thinking of the two demigods they had to leave behind.\n\n \n\nPercy realized that Apollo had taken the satyr who led them into the trap to punish him but had to leave quickly to avoid angering Zeus with interference on a quest. She felt a mix of relief and gratitude towards Apollo, knowing he was watching over them.\n\n\n \n\n\"We will need to hail a taxi and use the mist to convince the driver to drive us to LA. I am done with these stupid sidequests!\" Percy told Lee and he nodded.\nPercy then turned to the satyrs. She, Will and Lee would be taking the taxi but the pegasi needed to be provided for.\n\n \n\n\"Do you know where the pegasi my father gave us are? Marble, Cream, and Foam?\" Percy asked.\n\n \n\nThe satyr nodded, imediately understanding what she wanted from them. Percy was glad that this satyr was too smart to get himself skinned.\n\n \n\n\"Our team will travel back to Olympus soon to pick up more horses. In apology for our co-worker's actions, we can transport your pegasi back to Camp Half-Blood.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders. Their loyal mounts would be provided for.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, her voice filled with gratitude.\n\n \n\nWith renewed determination, she led Will and Lee away from the hotel, ready to continue their quest to return the bolt.\n\n \n\n\"We need to get to Santa Monica Pier,\" Percy said, determination in her voice. She hailed a taxi and flashed the credit card ring.\n\n \n\n\"Santa Monica Pier, as fast as you can.\"\n\n \n\nThe driver, a middle-aged man with a mischievous glint in his eye, nodded eagerly.\n\n \n\n\"You got it, little miss. Buckle up!\"\n\n \n\nLee, ready to use the mist to convince the driver if needed, relaxed when he saw the driver's enthusiasm.\n\n \n\n\"Looks like we won't need any tricks this time. A case of middle age crisis I think,\" he whispered to Will.\n\n \n\nPercy smiled at the driver's daredevil nature and deposited a suitable sum with the credit card ring. Her reminded her of certain aged Spartan generals who refused to retire or Alastor of Crete, head priest and son of Ares. They had all refused the indignities of old age to hold them back from enjoying life to the fullest.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, her voice warm.\n\n \n\nThe driver grinned.\n\n \n\n\"Hang on tight!\" He floored the gas pedal, and the taxi sped off, weaving through traffic with impressive skill.\n\n \n\nWill clutched his seatbelt.\n\n \n\n\"Mom, do you think we'll make it in time?\"\n\n \n\n\"We have to,\" Percy replied, her eyes fixed on the road ahead.\n\n \n\n\"Triton is waiting for us with Poseidon's pearls. We can't afford any more delays.\"\n\n \n\nLee glanced at Percy. \"You really think Triton will help us? While Asclepius and Hymenatos are nice to us I have heard things about Phobos and Deimos from Elis and Sherman.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded. \"He has to. Our dad does not want a war. It's our only chance to return the bolt and stop the war. Besides, Triton has always been honorable and dutiful. Crocus had met him a couple of times and only had good things to say about our immortal brother.\"\n\n \n\nThe driver glanced back at them through the rearview mirror.\n\n \n\n\"You kids on some kind of adventure?\"\n\n \n\nPercy chuckled. \"You could say that.\"\n\n \n\n\"Well, you're in good hands,\" the driver said, his grin widening.\n\n \n\n\"I'll get you there in no time.\"\n\n \n\nAs the taxi raced towards Santa Monica Pier, Percy felt a surge of hope. They were one step closer to their goal, and with any luck, they would succeed in their quest.\n\n \n\nTheir daredevil driver told them that he would get them there in five hours. Very pleased, Percy left him a huge tip, making the driver whoop with joy. When they had boarded Ares' truck it had been June 14. June 15 had passed by as they travelled in the war horse truck and they had lost a day at the Lotus casino. It as June 17 and they needed to hurry something fierce. It was a good thing that they had taken the backpacks that Apollo had given to them to the restaurant or they would have been in huge trouble. Percy would not have been able to risk going back to their suite. But, to her surprise, the bag that Ares had given them was hanging in Lee's arm. Percy was fairly certain throwing that on an armchair right before she went to shower. For some reason Ares wanted them to have that bag with them. Percy closed her eyes, once again praying to Apollo, Artemis and Poseidon to inform them of this new development. Ares needed watching.\n\n \n\nBefore Percy knew it they passed the California state line. Lee borrowed her cellphone to DM Apollo on his twitter account and get the exact address for the DOA studios in LA. They would have to hurry there after getting the pearls from Triton. Apollo replied instantly, and Percy saw the follower number in her anonymous account go up by one. She smiled as she took her phone back from Lee, borrowing his glasses.\n\n \n\nOut of morbid curiosity she checked on her official account. To her surprise, the number of followers had actually gone up. A lot of people were writing about her. A good number believed every lie that Smelly Gabe had spewed but quite a few pointed out that she was a twelve year old girl and based on previous posts, she loved her mother dearly. It was more likely that Smelly Gabe was the one behind Sally and Percy's disappearance. Likely to get Percy's earnings as a model of seven years.\n\n\n \n\nShe took note of a few posts by someone with the handle @godofwar that had really set the cat among the pigeons. Percy fought down a surge of fury. This was what Ares had meant by starting a war on Twitter, the jerk.\n\n \n\nAfter about five hours of lunatic driving, they arrived at Santa Monica Pier. The driver cheerfully gave them his contact information should they come back to Vegas and speed off. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the ocean. As they stepped out of the taxi, Triton emerged from the water, his trident gleaming.\n\n \n\n\"Percy,\" Triton greeted, handing her three shimmering pearls.\n\n \n\n\"These are magical and extremely difficult to make. Our father could only make three on such short notice. He tried to make a fourth one but it just did not happen. Rule of three as you know.\"\n\n \n\nPercy looked at the beautiful pearls, her dismay evident.\n\n \n\n\"Only three?\"\n\n \n\nTriton nodded grimly.\n\n \n\n\"You'll need to trust in Uncle Hades' honor.\"\n\n \n\nPercy sighed but nodded.\n\n \n\n\"We will. We don't really have a choice in the matter.\"\n\n\n \n\nTriton continued after a brief hesitant pause,\n\n \n\n\"Anteros, our brother, had a chat with Zephyrus, the West Wind, on our father's behalf so he knows that it is not only Apollo he will have to contend with. Anteros has promised to keep an eye on Zephyrus to ensure he stays away from you.\"\n\n \n\nPercy almost sagged with relief.\n\n \n\n\"Thank you, Triton. That was a huge concern.\"\n\n \n\nTriton waved at Will and then melted back into the water. Percy turned to Will and Lee, determination renewed.\n\n \n\n\"Let's go. We have a bolt to return.\"\n\n \n\nWill smiled. \"Lead the way, Mom.\"\n\n \n\nLee nodded. \"We're with you, Percy.\"\n\n \n\nPercy looked up routes on her cellphone.\n\n \n\n\"It'll take about forty minutes by bus and fifteen minutes by taxi,\" she said.\n\n \n\n\"Let's take a taxi,\" Will suggested. \"We need to get there fast.\"\n\n \n\nThey hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address. Before getting the taxi Percy made a quick stop to a nearby pet store and another to a bakery.\n\n \n\n\"I can't get you exactly there due to restrictions from the recent virus. The studio's owner pulled strings with the city council,\" the driver said, \"but I can get you pretty close, a five-minute walk.\"\n\n\n \n\nHuh, Percy wondered if the disease that Apollo caused when Percy was pushed of the Arch was affecting supernatural creatures in addition to mortals for Hades to go this far.\n\n \n\n\"That works,\" Percy replied. They put on their seatbelts and the driver took off.\n\n \n\nThe driver dropped them off by Crusty's Water Bed Palace. As they got out of the taxi, a strange man about seven feet tall, with gray, leathery skin and a reptilian smile, seized Will and dragged him into the Water Bed Palace.\n\n \n\n\"Will!\" Percy shouted, running after them with Lee.\n\n \n\nInside, Will was putting up a fierce fight, kicking and punching at the man. \"Let me go!\" he yelled.\n\n \n\nThe man grinned. \"I am Procrustes, and I want to avail you of my special brand of hospitality. I'll stretch you to six feet on my special beds.\"\n\n \n\nPercy was unfortunately familiar with him and his story, one of her most repulsive half-brothers. Theseus had told Icarus and Ariadne the tale as they made their way through the Labyrinth.\n\n \n\nPercy stepped forward as an idea sparked in her mind.\n\n \n\n\"Will is not the best to try first. He is too small. I would be the best control subject to start with.\"\nProcrustes released Will and seized Percy, but she was ready. She pushed Procrustes into the bed where shackles automatically chained him in place.\n\n \n\n\"Lee, cover Will's eyes,\" Percy ordered.\n\n \n\nLee quickly covered Will's eyes as Percy drew Riptide and beheaded Procrustes with one strike. The three demigods left immediately, not looking back.\n\n \n\n\"That was close,\" Will said, his voice shaking.\n\n \n\n\"Too close,\" Percy agreed. \"Let's get to DOA Studios and finish this accursed quest.\"\n\n\n \n\nAgainst her will, she could not help but feel a pang of sympathy for Theseus. If his journey from Troezen to Athens had been anything like their journey from Long Island to Hollywood it was no wonder he had turned out the way he did. Still, she would never forgive him for what he did to Ariadne.\n\n \n\nThey run toward the DOA Studios, not wanting to give the Fates yet another chance to ruin things for them with yet another monster and yet another obstacle. They walked breathlessly inside the lobby, relieved to finally be there.\n\n \n\nMuzak music suffused the space but Percy could not spy any speakers. She felt vaguely disappointed, the entrance of the Underworld had been far more impressive and intimidating on her last lives. The carpets and walls were steel gray, giving it an industrial and rather clinically sterile feel. Pencil cactuses grew in the corners, and their resemblance to skeleton hands gave a bit of ambiance but it was not enough. The furniture was black leather and fairly basic. Every seat was taken. There were souls everywhere, sitting on the furniture, the floor, standing against walls. All of them were listless and bored. Percy knew what they were. Souls who did not have the fare to go in. They would have to wait for one hundred years before they would be allowed to board Charon's boat. Their accommodations at least had improved. In the past they just had to wait by the banks of the Styx and many of them fell in and ceased to exist after contact with the acid waters.\n\n \n\nTaking a deep breath, Percy decided to approach the security guard's desk on a raised podium. Charon had changed somewhat with the times. He was still tall and elegant, with dark skin and pale hair. But that hair had been long on the last two times Percy had seen him, nearly reaching his waist, now it was cropped short, military style. Instead of the dramatic dark robes of the past, Charon wore a bespoke and exquisitely tailored Italian suit. Percy recognized the fabric as cashmere and she was fairly certain that the designer was Brunello Cucinelli. Galaxaura's boyfriend wore the same. The same boyfriend that if she read between the lines was her immortal brother Anteros.\n\n \n\nCharon looked up from his desk, his expression souring at the sight of living souls.\n\n \n\n\"I never want to see you here as dead, Percy,\" he grumbled.\n\n \n\n\"Your boyfriend will give me a mountain of work again.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled apologetically.\n\n \n\n\"Sorry for the trouble, Charon.\" She reached into her bag and pulled out a hefty sack of gold drachma she had liberated from Medusa's lair.\n\"A gift for you. After all, that lovely Brunello Cucinelli suit you're wearing doesn't come cheap.\"\n\n \n\nCharon's eyes widened slightly, visibly flattered.\n\n \n\n\"Most people mistake it for Armani. It annoys me. As if I would wear something that basic and common.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, understanding his frustration.\n\n \n\n\"We need to meet withLord Hades regarding the recent situation. Could you take us past the Styx?\"\n\n \n\nCharon hesitated, his eyes narrowing.\n\n \n\n\"And why should I do that?\"\n\n \n\nPercy held up the credit card ring Apollo had given her.\n\n \n\n\"The next five suits are on me.\"\n\n \n\nCharon's demeanor shifted instantly. He pulled out his tablet, quickly ordering five Brunello Cucinelli suits. Percy used the credit card ring to pay for them. Charon smiled as it went through and he got a delivery estimate. Percy wondered if it would be Hermes delivering them.\n\n \n\n\"Alright,\" Charon said, a hint of a smile playing on his lips as he put the tablet away.\n\n \n\n\"Follow me.\"\n\n \n\nAs they walked towards the elevator that would take them down to the River Styx, Will looked up at his mother.\n\n \n\n\"Mom, how do you know Charon?\"\n\n\n \n\nPercy sighed, memories of her past lives swirling in her mind.\n\n\n \n\n\"In my past lives, I met him after I died, he took me over. Both times, I had the rites done properly and had no trouble passing on. Charon remembers me from those times, since my deaths were rather dramatic.\"\n\n \n\nThey reached the elevator, and Charon pressed the button for the lowest level.\n\n\n \n\n\"You know,\" Charon said, glancing at Percy, \"Icarus was always one of my favorites. Such a tragic story. While his death caused me a lot of work, it would have been much, much worse if you had not done the right thing and obeyed the will of the Fates.\"\n\n \n\nPercy chuckled softly and sadly. Icarus had only had one choice. The one he had taken. But the average immortal being was too inherently selfish to understand that.\n\n \n\n\"Thanks, Charon. I appreciate that.\"\n\n\n \n\nThe elevator doors opened, revealing the dark, swirling waters of the River Styx. Charon led them to a small boat, its wooden frame creaking as they stepped aboard. He took his place at the helm, guiding the boat through the murky waters.\n\n \n\nAs they sailed, the souls of the dead reached out, their ghostly hands brushing against the boat. Will shivered, moving closer to his mother.\n\n \n\n\"This place gives me the creeps.\"\n\n \n\nPercy wrapped an arm around him.\n\n \n\n\"I know, Wil. Just stay close.\"\n\n \n\nLee peered over the edge of the boat, fascinated by the spectral forms.\n\n \n\n\"It's amazing how many souls are here.\"\n\n \n\nCharon nodded, the amount of souls seeming to displease him. Then again it was his task to transfer them over. Such a repetitive action would have gotten old thousands of years ago.\n\n \n\n\"The Underworld is always busy. But don't worry, I'll get you to the Gates of Hades safely.\"\n\n \n\nThey continued their journey in silence, the only sound the gentle lapping of the water against the boat. Finally, they reached the shore, where the imposing gates of Hades' palace loomed before them.\n\n \n\nCharon helped them off the boat, his expression serious.\n\n \n\n\"Good luck, Percy. And remember, I never want to see you here as a dead soul.\"\n\n\n \n\nPercy smiled, giving him a nod.\n\n \n\n\"Thanks, Charon. I'll be careful but I can't make you any promises. It is up to the Fates.\"\n\n \n\nWith that, Percy, Will, and Lee made their way towards the gates, ready to face whatever challenges awaited them in the Underworld.\n\nUnfortunately it is way to early to get the Di Angelos out of the Casino. Besides Hades would pitch a fit if he saw them with Percy since it would look like Percy is trying to blackmail him with his kids lives.\n\nThe trio journey the underworld and have a close call\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nPercy felt naive for expecting the Underworld to have stayed like her past selves remembered it. She recalled dimly lit and intimidating caverns, the black, forbidding waters of the Styx. The river of the eldest Oceanid still had black waters, but unlike in the distant past, these waters were now deeply polluted with the hopes and dreams that the vast amount of souls left behind when they crossed. Even it's acid waters could not keep up with the overpopulation of the last few centuries.\n\nJust like before the Styx circled the Underworld nine times. It used to be so sacred, Hyacinthus and Icarus had barely even dared to utter the name. Neither of her past selves had ever needed to swear an oath on the Styx. Hyacinthus had been sternly warned against doing so by Clio, who knew all two well what happened to mortals who swore such a sacred oath carelessly. Icarus had been warned against doing so by Artemis. Looking back at the waters Percy recalled how she had sworn by the Styx to the Furies that she had nothing to do with the theft of the Bolt or the Helm, but they had not beleved her. Percy had been born against an oath. Her father had drank from these acidic, polluted and frankly revolting waters to protect her from the consequences of his broken oath. From what had been said about poor little Thalia Grace, Zeus had not even done that bare minimum.\n\nAs Percy looked back at the river, she heard the whispering of the eldest Oceanid, Styx. The river goddess was distinctly unhappy about Percy's existence, despite the oath Poseidon had sworn not to have any children. Styx wished that Poseidon had not descended into the Underworld to drink from the acid waters the day Percy was born. This act had limited what Styx could do to Percy. She couldn't send monsters to torment her, but she still had a shot at Percy.\n\nPercy frowned, wondering what the eldest Oceanid could have done to her. Styx's voice echoed in her mind, \"Ask your father, he knows.\"\n\nInstead of the formidable and intimidating gates of bronze and black marble that Percy recalled, what awaited them was a something like airport security cranked up to the eleven. Percy had never been at an airport, her maternal grandparents had died in a plane crash and her mother was not fond of air travel as a result but she had seen what airports looked like in movies and documentaries.\n\n \n\nShe saw three different entranes under one gigantic pitch black archway that stated YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EREBUS. Giant signage was new, back in ancient times only a small percentage of people, the elite, were able to read. The three entrances for some reason had metal detectors with security cameras, making Percy frown. Had it became a habit for living people to enter the Underworld? In ancient times katabasis was vanishintly rare. Even Hyacinthus, Spartan prince that he had been, had only dared to descend on the request of an Elder Titaness and with the help and protection of an Olympian god. Dead souls would not have anything metallic on them.\n\n \n\nBeyond each detector, Percy could see tollbooths filled with daimones clad in black robes. She smiled despite herself, even if times had changed and the Underworld with them, the daimones had not lost their sense of theatricality.\n\n \n\nThe loud howls and growls of what sounded like a very hungry canine creature made Will and Lee jump. Percy craned her neck to look for Cereberus, removing from her backpack two bags. After receiving the pearls from Triton at the Santa Monica Pier, they had quickly ducked into a pet store and a bakery for items to help them appease Hades' dog.\n\n \n\nThe departed souls were divided in three very long lines. Two of the lines were labelled ATTENDANT ON DUTY, and one claimed to be EZ DEATH. The third line was the one moving steadily. The other two were very slow, crawling at a snail's pace.Percy noticed Will's frown at the three lines. Mentally chastising Chiron for failing to explain yet another thing that a demigod should know she spoke.\n\n \n\n\"EZ DEATH likely goes straight to the Asphodel Fields.\" Both Will and Lee looked at her.\n\n \n\n\"It is where most people go. Boring and dreary but safe. Sometimes wrongdoers tried to sneak there to avoid punishment but they were always spotted and thrown into the Fields of Punishment.\"\n\n \n\n\"So the other lines go to the judges?\" Asked Will.\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, face twisting with disgust as she recalled who one of those judges were.\"Why are you making that face?\" Lee wanted to know.\n\n \n\nPercy groaned in disgust.\n\n \n\n\"I am familiar with the three judges. All three were disgusting. Minos fed thousands of people to his monstrous stepson. Rhadamanthus was a greedy bastard who taxed his subjects to starvation and Aeacus completely mismanaged a plague because he did not want his revenues to fall due to enforced quarantine and all of his original subjects perished. But Zeus, Aeacus' father transformed ants into people so his son could still call himself a king. Those people were better of as ants.\"\n\n \n\nLee frowned in confusion.\n\n \n\n\"If they were so vile, who come they are honored as Judges of the Dead?\"\n\n \n\nPercy laughed as she pointed to the lines.\n\n \n\n\"Honored? Look at this. They are forced to labour every moment of a long eternity without a single break. This is not reward or honor, this is punishment. Elysium is reward, not being a judge of the dead. If Hades had thrown them in the Fields of Punishment like they so richly deserve Zeus would have thrown a fit. This way they get worked to undeath without Zeus being able to say a word. In fact I think Zeus is even proud that his sons are exploited.\"\n\n \n\n\"Still, such horrible men have no right to judge others.\" Will said.\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head.\n\n \n\n\"Hades has not given them free reign. They all have enchanted podiums where they must sit to deliver their judgement. The podiums force them to judge according to Hades' will, not their own.\"\n\n \n\nPercy was certain that even if Daedalus, who had boiled Minos alive were the one being judged, it would be Hades how decided where Icarus' father went, not Minos.\n\n \n\n\"Our dad once mentioned that William Shakespeare, our brother is one of the part time judges there. You don't think...\"\n\n \n\nPercy shook her head.\n\n \n\n\"No. The three old tyrans are just not enough for the influx of souls. Hades has to supplement judges so he just choses remarkable mortals. I very much doubt that Shakespeare did anything heinous. Also it tweaks Zeus' nose because he only wants his sons to be judges.\"\n\n \n\n\"What are the Asphodel fields like?\" Lee asked next.\n\n \n\n\"Just a never ending wheat field. Nothing more, nothing less.\" Percy told him, curious why he was asking but Lee did not seem inclined to explain.\n\n \n\nPercy saw the daimones pull aside one soul from the EZ DEATH line and bodily checked him. Percy recognized him from news she had watched. He used to be in charge of a charity collecting funds to treat children with cancer but he had been pocketing the money himself causing the death of several children who could not receive treatment. The daimones firmly placed him in one of the other lines, ensuring that he would get to judgement. Percy smiled, glad that despite the overcrowding, justice was still being done.\n\n \n\nThey moved closer to the gates. The howling got closer and it put Percy on alert. Not far away from them the air shimmered and Percy saw huge claws and fangs. She immediately reached for the bag from the pet store, pulling out a red ball. She squeezed it, producing a squeaky sound that made Cereberus' ears perk up. She smiled at the three headed dog.\n\n \n\n\"Hello! Hi Cereberus! Do you want to play?\"\n\n \n\nPercy threw the ball at the dog who shrank down from the size of an elephant to about as tall as Percy. Cerberus caught the ball and began pressing it with his paws, making more squeaky sounds. Percy pulled out a red plastic stick from the bag, making Cereberus look at her once more. She threw the stick and he immediately chased after it, finding it swiftly and then returning it to her. She took the stick from the drooling laws of his middle head and patted each head.\n\n \n\n\"Good job! Such a good boy!\" She cooed at the fearsome guardian of the underworld.\n\n \n\nShe threw the stick again and this time it was the left head who got it and returned it to her. Then again so the right head could get a turn. Percy then took out the other bag. The bakery near the pet store had a selection of dog treats.\n\n \n\n\"I know that it is not Spartan spiced honey cakes but these should be pretty good too?\"\n\n \n\nCerberus perked up at the sound of treats and eagerly licked her hands. Percy smiled and fed him the treats.\n\n \n\n\"Do you remember me buddy? I have been here before. More than three thousand years I descended here to get water from the Lethe. I gave you treats then too.\"\n\n \n\nCerberus tilted his head in curiosity, gently sniffing her before letting out a happy bark. Percy smiled as she patted him. Such a good dog, and the poor thing looked so lonely. She wondered if anyone took care of him. Like all dogs he needed love and care. Someone to play with him.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately they had to leave because the daimones noticed them. Percy apologized to Cereberus before she, Will and Lee had to rush through the metal gates and then evade the daimones. Percy could hear Cereberus' sad hows a they run.\n\n \n\n\"That poor dog.\" Will said.\n\n \n\n\"For a three headed giant dog he is adorable.\" Lee opined.\n\n \n\n\"Yes he is. And he is lonely the poor dear. A neglected pet is such a sad thing.\" Percy told them as she gathered Will close to her.\n\n \n\nTheir next destination was the Asphodel Fields. Percy gawked in utter astonishment when she saw it. Before it had been desolate fields dotted with people. Now it was a nightmare. It reminded Percy of a crowded famous rock star concert, if the stadium was packed with millions upon millions of fans and the lights had gone out. The black grass had long been trampled. Percy could see a few black poplars growing sparsely among the throngs of dead souls.\n\n \n\nShe pictured every person that she had met in her short life. This was what awaited most of them after death. She pictured every classmate, teacher, salesperson, waiter ending up here. It was a bleak picture. The underworld had more people than it could comfortably hold. Percy took out her phone and snapped a few pictures. Next time someone accused Hades of trying to start a war to get more subjects she would show them these overcrowded conditions. Percy already knew that it was not the dark king, but this was further confirmation.Percy looked up, just like in her past lives, the underworld was a gargantuan cavern. She could look up and see the ceiling even if it was so high that it looked more like storm clouds adorned with glowing silvery stalactites. Percy clutched Will closer. A few times, when Hades had been especially angry, a stalactite or two had fallen. Usually over the Fields of Punishment. Percy spied a few of the stalactite over Asphodel indicating that Hades had a few more temper tantrums in the last few centuries and millenia. Idly she had to wonder how many had been caused by Disney's Hercules.\n\n \n\nPercy, Will and Lee tried their best to blend with the dead and to avoid the daimones. Lee looked closely at the dead, as if he was trying to find someone. Percy was almost tempted to ask but she decided otherwise. They moved along, keeping up with the new arrivals from the gattes and the large black pavilion which was announced by more clarly labelled signage:\n\n \n\nJUDGEMENTS FOR ELYSIUM AND ETERNAL DAMNATIONWelcome, Newly Deceased!\n\n \n\nThe lines past the pavilion were quite smaller. On the left, the daimones escorted struggling souls to the Fields of Punishment. That area was visible in the distance, glowing and smoking, a huge, desolate wasteland doted with rivers of lava, minefields and quite a lot of parbed wire separating the areas of torture. Percy culd see souls used for sport by hellhounds, burned at the stake. Fairly standard punishments and more unusual ones like people forced to run in cactus patches completely naked. She covered Will's eyes. And to her surprise there were people forced to listen to opera music.\n\n \n\nFar away, on a hill she could see what could only be Sisyphus rolling his boulder up the hill. Percy saw much worse things too. She firmly kept her hand over he son's eyes as she guided him through.The right side was must more palpable. Percy was very familiar with this one. It lead toward what had been a walled city but it was now a gated community. She smiled briefly as she saw Elysium, where Hyacinthus had been taken right after death. The place that had been home to Icarus and Alexios for over three thousand years before their respective rebirths. Percy could see palaces and manors in the style in which she had lived in her previous lives. Disctitively Roman villas, medieval castles and Victorian manors. Gorgeous flowers bloomed everywhere, the grass was in every shade of color possible. If Percy strained she could make out the noise of happiness, laughter and pleasant chatter.\n\n \n\nJust like before in the middle of Elysium was a beautiful green lake. From her previous lives Percy knew that it was a saltwater lake. In the lake there were three islands. The islands of Blest. Her destination if she died in this life. Percy swallowed with dread and unease. If she went there she would be forever separated from Apollo, Asclepius, Clio, Artemis and Ariadne. She would even be separated from Will. She looked away from it before Will noticed how upset she was.\n\n \n\n\"Lets go my darling,\" She told her son, grabbing hold of his hand.\n\n \n\nThey vacated the area and walked further into Asphodel. The lights dimed. The colors faded from them until they looked like black and white photographs come to life. The crowds of souls became sparser. They walked for miles until they heard screeching int he distance. In the distance they saw an elegant palace made of shiny black obsidian. In the parapets Percy saw the Furies in their monstrous forms. The three Kindly Ones clearly saw them but made no move to stop or confront them. Likely they knew that they were here to talk to Hades. Maybe were even ordered by him to let them pass.\n\n \n\nThe backpack hanging on Lee's back tightened and began dragging him away. Percy and Will startled. Lee immediately began to try and remove it but the straps were stubborn. Percy pulled out Katoptris.\"Lee!\" Called out Will, grabbing hold of his brother. Will did his best to hold on but the force dragging Lee was too strong. Percy grabbed hold of her son as she tried to reach Lee.\n\n \n\n\"Remove the backpack!\" She told Lee.\n\n \n\n\"I can't!\" He cried out as he was indeed struggling to shrug of the clearly enchanted or cursed item.\n\n \n\nPercy for a moment thought that this was Hades doing, to ensure that they did not grew cold feet and left but instead of being dragged to the dark palace, Lee was dragged sharply to the left, int he opposite direction of Hades' home.\n\n \n\nThe ground grew coarser and steeper. Percy's blood chilled as she and Will run after Lee. The cavern walls narrowed and became a tunel. Lee did his best to hold on to protrusions along the wall. Percy sprinted ahead, leaving Will behind. Maybe it was not the backpack itself but what was in the backpack. Maybe if she could open it if not cut it off Lee it would stop dragging him off.\n\n \n\nThe tunned grew colder and darker and Percy could feel the evil emanating from further in. Her blood turned to ice as she realised what this was. A gateway to the pit. She had seen it recently in her dream of the Crooked One and his servant.\n\n \n\nPercy seized Lee and tore open the backpack. She was not one bit surprised to see the box tha Luke Castellan had given to her son' brother fly off into the chasm. Just to be on the safe side she cut off the tightened straps on Lee's shoulders. Lee breathed in relief.\n\n \n\n\"Mom! Lee!\" Will called out from further back.\n\n \n\n\"Will! Stay where you are! Don't move any closer!\" She screamed.\n\n \n\nThe last place she wanted her son in was anywhere near the Pit.\n\n \n\nLee grabbed his backpack by the upper handle and the two of them run away from the Pit and towards Will.\n\n \n\n\"Gods above!\" Lee called out.\n\n \n\n\"What was that!\"\n\n \n\nPercy grimaced.\n\n \n\n\"The flying shoes that you were given. They flew straight into the Pit.\"\n\n \n\nLee paled, understanding the implications.\n\n \n\n\"No! It can't be!\" He implored her.\n\n \n\nPercy gave him a look of pity.\n\n \n\n\"Luke Castellan is a natural thief as a son of Hermes. He has access to an item that grants invisibility. And everytime he speaks of his father, I can see the loathing in his eyes and hear the hatred in his voice.\"\n\n \n\nLee gave her a look of both anger and disbelief before he slumped in sad acceptance.\n\n \n\n\"He is my friend.\"\n\n \n\n\"You will be betrayed by one that calls you a friend.\" Percy quoted the prophecy.\n\n \n\n\"Seems that the prophecy does not just apply to me but to all three of us.\" She told him.\n\n \n\nThey caught up with a terrified Will who immediately rushed to hug the both of them. Percy kissed his curls. Lee was looking at Will with a puzzled expression. Percy gave him a questioning look.\n\n \n\n\"The incident a year and a half ago.\"\n\n \n\nLee spoke, making Will go tense in her arms. Percy raised an eye brow. Not liking the sound of this.\n\n \n\n\"What accident?\"\n\n \n\nLee swallowed before answering.\n\n \n\n\"Our cabin decided not to tell you, but two Solstices ago after attending the party at Olympus we travelled back. At our stop at Stony Brook one of the unclaimed demigods in Cabin Eleven misted Will to stay behind.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's heart stuttered in her chest. Her arms tightened around Will who drew even closer to her.\n\n \n\n\"Will was surrounded by monsters but he jumped into the sea and swam to camp.\"\n\n \n\nPercy's jaw dropped.\n\n \n\n\"He swam to camp! It is twenty five miles of sea from Stony Brook to Camp, and it was December!\"\n\n \n\nLee smiled.\n\n \n\n\"He takes after you then. But once he was back, dad appeared. He found out who the person responsible was...\"\n\n \n\nLee paused and looked at her. Percy rolled her eyes.\n\n \n\n\"Punished him severely. I know Lee. I was never naive about your dad's temper.\"\n\n \n\nLee gave her a look of almost disbelief.\n\n \n\n\"I supposed not. But all the campers were shocked and horrfied. Especially the ones in Cabin Eleven. Luke might not be the thief and he could just have done this for revenge.\"\n\n \n\n\"Were they shocked and horrified that someone in Cabin Eleven tried to murder a seven year old?\" Percy hissed.\n\n \n\nShe was sick and tired of people murdering her kids. First it was Alexios, murdered by a greedy son of a bitch of bitches. Then it was Asclepius, murdered by his own grandfather for saving a life. At least Asclepius had gotten to ascend to godhood which made it possible for her to meet him someday, hopefully soon. But now someone had tried to murder Will and campers were holding against him because Apollo frightened them when he punished the attempted murderer.\n\n \n\n\"It was really horrible to see.\" Lee told her.\n\n \n\n\"I don't care. That demigod tried to murder my child. Had I been ther I would have killed him myself.\"\n\n \n\nLee grimaced but stayed quiet.\n\n \n\n\"Let's go. We have to meet with Lord Hades.\" Percy told him, firmly taking her son by hand. Lee followed, backpack in hand. A reminder of their close call. Percy was in disbelief that they had almost fallen into Tartarus. Apollo, Artemis and Poseidon needed to know about this but she knew that prayers of people in the Underworld did not reach the gods in Olympus. It would likely reach Hermes, but Percy did not think it wise to pray to him when all evidence was pointing to his son being the thief.\n\nGetting to the confrontation with Hades is hard to write, but soon I will have to stop delaying the inevitable. Going to reread a few more Hades scenes from the books and watch that episode in the show.\n\nPercy meets Hades\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nThe close brush with the Pit left them all rather rattled. Percy had it easier than Lee due to her past lives experience. As Hyacinthus he had been a crown prince and thus the one people looked to for leadership and assurance in a crisis. He had always needed to appear unruffled and in control. Amyclas and Sparta would not have tolerated anything else in the heir. Icarus had needed to be in control of himself when in Minos' court. Occasionally Icarus had slipped up and Ariadne had needed to do damage control. Percy decided to lean on Hyacinthus' experiences the most to face Lord Hades. She and Lee ensured to walk slightly ahead of Will and to shield him with their own bodies.\n\nIt was reasuring. Percy had noticed that outside his own cabin Will was somewhat isolated at camp due to both his age and Apollo's blatant favorism. At least Lee and the rest of Apollo's children had Will's back. Percy swallowed down the rage that someone had tried to murder her child. Lee refused to say exactly what Apollo had done to the culprit, but Percy could imagine. Her beloved had always been rather fond of skinning. Even the modern parts of her could not bring themselves to care. Will was her child, her mortal, fragile child. His safety was paramount, no matter the price.\n\nPercy looked up at the parapets of Hades' palace. The Furies flew high, but the three of them had the demigod trio in sights. Percy could not tell which one was Mrs. Dodds, but none of them seemed pleased to see two sons of Apollo. Given that Apollo had unwillingly been party to their disgrace and dishonor during the mock trial of Orestes, Percy was well aware why. She wondered what Zeus had been thinking. While it had curbed Hades' influence and power in the human world, it had also handed the world to the humans in a sense.\n\nIf a court could decide if a kinslayer, the most accursed of all wrongdoers, could get off scott free, then what stopped everyone else from committing all sort of sacriledges and then just bribing a few judges? She wondered if the laws of non interference were just a cover for Zeus' blunder. Unfortunately she would never be able to speculate these thoughts to anyone, not even Apollo. But she was certain that Apollo had thought similar at some point. He definitely was not happy with the laws of non interference. How it must grate him to be considered just a myth, the invention of some long dead bard.\n\nThey reached the gates and stopped to admire the engravings. Predictably it was scenes of death. A lot of them were from ancient times. Percy saw the Attic city petrified of the map by Medusa, what had to be the Siege of Troy, the Burning of Rome. But also more recent events. Hiroshima and Nagasaki which made Percy bite her lip. How was such a weapon allowed to exist? The atomic bomb imitated godly wrath, and not just any godly wrath but Elder Olympian godly wrath.\n\nShe looked away from it and saw a trench from WWI, full with solders wearing gas masks. Percy also saw African famine victims waiting to be given food. Leaning closer she noticed that the etchings seemed ancient, even the one depicting fairly modern events. She wondered if these scenes were prophecies made thousands of years ago. If yes, who had done so? Apollo had never been permitted in the Underworld without Hades' leave and the two gods had always had some degree of bad blood between them. Apollo would not have agreed to do this for Hades. Percy could not think of an underworld deity with prophetic powers.\n\nThe doors opened for them and they stepped inside the courtyard. Will let out a gasp of amazement at the sight of the garden. Percy could not help but smile and stroke his golden curls.\n\n\"Mom, this place is beautiful!\" Will told her, craning his neck to see.\n\nPercy eyed the garded with more caution. It was full of multicolored mushrooms, plenty of shrubs that she recognized as poisonous, bioluminescent plants and more. In many areas, she saw gemstones of many kinds. Piles of enormous rubies, clusters of diamonds, glinting in the dim light.\n\nPercy then spotted the statues, or to be more accurate, Medusa's victims. She had seen the receipts and knew that Persephone was a frequent client of Medusa's grisly artwork. To Percy's horror, most of the statues were children. She gathered Will closer to her and reminded herself that Medusa was slain and according to interview that Apollo had given to Olympus Weekly, this time it was for good. The dreaded gorgon would not rise again. She looked away from the children. The rest of the statues were satyrs, centaurs and perhaps nymphs. All of them had grotesque, terrified smiles on their faces. Percy gently steered Will so he would not look to closely. She looked at Lee and saw the expression of utter disgust in his face. He too had realised what the statues were.\n\nThe centre of the garden was the piece de resistance, an orchard of pomegranate trees. Her mouth watered as her nose caught a whiff of the wonderful sweet and tart scent of the fruits. In her previous lives, while figs had been her favorite fruit, she had still love pomegranates. She shook her head to clear the impulse to go and pick one. Percy's hand curled gently on Will's shoulder to keep him in place. With her other hand she grabbed hold of Lee.\n\nLee had a dazed look in his eyes and almost stepped of the path. Percy's hand darted quickly like a viper to grab his wrist. Lee startled, his own hand lashing out. His nails had grown out in the last few days and were awfully sharp. His attempt to slap Percy's hand away gave her a fairly deep scratch. A few drops of her blood fell on the soil next to the paved path.\n\n\"Lee!\" Percy called out, hissing slightly in pain.\n\nLee startled, the dazzed look in his eyes replaced by horror when he saw the bloody scratches on her hand.\n\n\"Percy! I am so sorry!\" He told her.\n\nLee grabbed hold of her hand and Percy saw his fingers glow slightly. The slight pain receded and when Lee released her hand she saw that the scratches were gone.\n\n\"Don't worry about it. It was literally just a scratch.\" She tried defusing the situation with humour but Lee still seemed tense.\n\n\"Those pomegranates are enchanted to tempt people. Don't worry. Just focus on the task ahead and ignore the allure. Okay?\" Percy advised him.\n\nLee nodded, still giving guilty glances at her hand as they walked.\n\nThey went up the steps of the palace, between black columns. Percy was reminded of Amyclas palace with it's saffron columns and of the Knossos palace with the red columns. She felt a pang of nostalgia. The architecture was so similar. The portico ws black marble and she wondered if Hades, Persephone and their children ever got sick of the color black. It would explain the very colorful garden.\n\nThe entry hall had a bronze floor so polished that she could see her reflection. She looked up and there was no ceiling but then again, it never rained.\n\nThe doorways were guarded by skeletons bedecked in armour. She recognized a lot of the Ancient Greek armour from her past lives, some Roman styles from her personal history studies. British redcoats and almost every other military uniform in existence. All the skeleton guards held weapons. Be it spears and swords or muskets and automatic riffles. None of them even twitched at the presence of three living demigods but all of their hollow sockets followed their movements eerily.\n\nThe main doorway was guarded by two skeleton solders in Marine uniform. They held rocket-propelled grenade launchers. As they walked past the two Marines, Percy felt the weight on the bags on her back increase. She abruptly stopped, making Lee and Will crash on her.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" Lee asked her in concern.\n\nPercy removed her original backpack and the one given to her by Ares. She opened the first one, nothing was out of order. She then opened the second one. Percy screamed and threw the bag away when she saw what it was. She grabbed Will and scrambled away from it.\n\n\"Mom! What is happening!\"\n\nPercy pointed at the bag and the lightning bolt that was poking out of it. Lee gasped.\n\n\"Is that the bag that Ares gave us?!\" He yelled.\n\n\"Yes.\" Percy spoke.\n\n\"This was his plan all along. The stupid little sidequest at Waterland was not to waste our time and delay us. It was so he could plant the Bolt and frame us!\"\n\nLee looked at Percy and then at the Bolt.\n\n\"Shit.\" Was his short but succinct reply.\n\nPercy heard clapping and looked directly ahead of her. Hades, the Dark King and Lord of the Underworld sat on his macabre throne. He was at least ten feet tall, dressed in black silk robes and on his head was a simple crown of braided gold. His skin was paper white and his shoulder length hair was the same shade of jet black that Poseidon's and Percy's hair was. But unlike Poseidon's unruly waves and Percy's hyacinthine curls, Hades had pin straight hair. The power emanating from him almost caused Percy to fall to her knees.\n\nPercy decided to bow to her uncle instead, tugging the hands of Will and Lee so they followed suit.\n\n\"Lord Uncle.\" She greeted the god who had been her king for three thousand years.\n\n\"My former subject, reborn against my wishes.\" Was the reply.\n\nPercy winced. Even if she wanted to lie in this situation, the enchantments on Hades' throne room prevented any soul from lying to him.\n\n\"I could not resist the temptation to be alive again.\" She decided to tell him the truth on her own volition rather than have it forced out of her.\n\nHades gave her an unimpressed glare.\n\n\"However, Lord Uncle. I did not steal your brother's Bolt or your Helm of Darkness.\"\n\nHades eyed the bag and the Bolt peeking out of it. He gestured to it.\n\n\"Explain in detail. From your little conversation with the sunny spawn of your lover, Ares seems to be responsible?\"\n\nPercy picked up the bag and passed it to Lee before moving closer to Hades. She pulled out her own backpack where the offerings to Hades were. She pulled out the glowing, petrified heart of the sun dragon. Then the potted planting of the Icarus tree and the black calyx with the design of Hades and Persephone on their thrones. She gathered the items Apollo had given them and approached the throne. She carefully placed them before Hades.\n\n\"Offerings for our intrusion in your domain.\" She told him\n\n\"The petrified heart of a sun dragon. The rarest of gems. A cutting form the Icarus tree, the only one of its kind. An calyx dating back to the rein of Minos in Crete. I personally crafted it myself from the finest materials under Daedalus' supervision. It was meant to be offered to your shrine on the first anniversary of Alexios' death but Theseus happened shortly before and then I died and Daedalus had to flee.\"\n\nHades waved a hand and the objects flew up, level with his eyes. He inspected each one, nodded and then a three skeletons appeared. One took the Icarus mini tree and headed toward the garden. Another took the petrified sun dragon hear and walked off to a direction Percy assumed was the treasury. The third one picked up the calyx and went in another direction, likely where Hades kept his ceramics.\n\n\"I suspected that it was a war deity when I first heard of it my lord.\"\n\nThat startled a laughlike sound from Hades.\n\n\"You suspected a brave war deity and not evil old Hades?\"\n\nPercy winced as she recalled Chiron's words and suspicions against Hades.\n\n\"You would have no motive to cause a war. The primary flaw of mortal is well, mortality. All mortals will die and come in your kingdom. The little I recall from my stay here was your rage everytime there was a large scale war or natural disaster. I know how much you dislike excessive paperwork. So you would have no reason to commission the theft of the Bolt.\"\n\nHades looked like he wanted to smirk.\n\n\"Continue.\" He ordered.\n\nPercy took a deep breath.\n\n\"But there were some questionable actions. One of the Furies masqueraded as Mrs. Dodds and attacked me at the museum, accusing me of stealing something from my uncle. At the time I had no idea that I even had an uncle.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes. My mother is an only child and all I knew of my father was that he was lost at sea.\"\n\n\"Lost at sea?\" That prompted a raised eyebrow and Percy felt herself flush. It sounded ridiculous and she could not believe that she had once believed it.\n\n\"It is what my mother told me.\" She defended.\n\n\"Given that you had no motive to steal or want the Bolt then the only reason you would undertake this actions would be if your own symbol of power, your Helm was stolen.\"\n\n\"Only a war god would want a three way war between the Big Three. Ares gave himself away when he waylaid us in Denver to assign us a quest. I realised then that it was him and I prayed to Apollo, Artemis and my father to let them know of my suspicions.\"\n\nHades eyed the bag.\n\n\"My Helm is not there.\" He told them.\n\n \n\nPercy grimaced, looking at the Bolt in distaste.\n\n\"I believe that Ares has it. But there is more.\"\n\nHades gestured at her to continue.\n\nPercy told him about her demigod dream. The mortal servant addressing an immortal entity as 'The Crooked One'. Hades drew in a sharp breath and almost sat up on his throne.\n\n\"On our way here. Lee's backpack started to drag him toward the Pit. We managed to open it and the flying shoes that were gifted to Lee flew straight in.\"\n\nHades finally looked at Lee, inspecting him in a cold and clinical manner.\n\n\"Who gived him those shoes?\" The god asked.\n\n\"Luke Castellan, son of Hermes. He was also one of Thalia Grace's two demigod companions. The other one possesses a cap of invisibility, gifted to her from her mother Athena. Castellan is the most likely suspect for the thief but I am not sure if the other one is involved as well.\"\n\nHades' obsidian eyes grew cold at the mention of Thalia Grace.\n\n\"I can't be lied to while siting on my throne. And in your second life you did build a shrine to me and you did aid my son and priest in his duties to me. I will act on your testimony Perseus Jackson.\"\n\nPercy's heart stuttered at the mention of Nicodemos.\n\n\"Lord Uncle. What happened to him. To Nicodemos?\"\n\nHades' mouth tightened.\n\n\"Your death greatly grieved my son. More importantly, he lost a trusted and valuable quest partner. Without you, he had to do everything on his own. Eventually, he slipped up and used his powers where others saw. He died from poison in his food, given to him by one of his fellow priests. That priest still screams in the Field of Punishment.\"\n\nPercy felt tears run down her face. Nicodemos had deserved so much better. Hades' eyes followed the tears from her eyes to where they fell on the polished bronze floor.\n\n\"You weep for a son of mine?\" His tone was curios, almost amused.\n\nPercy glared.\n\n\"Nicodemos was my friend. Is he in Elysium?\"\n\nHades eyed her blankly for a moment.\n\n\"He was, but chose to be reborn about eighty years ago. He was once again my son. When he was ten years old, a certain prophecy was issued. Zeus demanded that I send him and his sister to Camp Half-Blood. I refused. Zeus vaporised the hotel they were staying with their mother.\"\n\nWill clutched her hand tighter, his face clouding with sadness but no surprise. Will already knew that Zeus murdered Hades' children. Percy looked at her uncle, mulling over his phrasing. Hades said that Zeus vaporised the Hotel, not that Zeus killed the children. She thought back to the two demigods at Lotus Hotel who thought it was still 1945. The boy's name was Nico and he had obsidian black eyes, much like Hades eyes. Percy decided to keep this to herself. Hades would not react well. Thinking that she meant to blackmail him. Besides little Nico would be safer there. It was a far from ideal situation, for him to be frozen in time, but better than Zeus killing him. Unlike Percy, who had several gods invested in her living status, Nico and Biaca would get an automatic kill order from the council. Hades had never been popular and it had only gotten worse in modern times.\n\n \n\nHades's voice snapped her out of her thoughts. He snapped his fingers and Percy's mother Sally appeared, frozen in golden light. Percy startled.\n\n\"Originally I meant to offer you your mother back in exchange for my Helm but you don't have it.\"\nHades looked at the Bolt.\n\n\"Unlike what my youngest brother believes I have never wanted that hideous thing. It is however powerful. And if my father is returning, I will need a powerful weapon to defend my realm from him.\"\n\nPercy looked at her mother, then at the Bolt. She then looked at Will, her son. Her hand went to her pocket, where the pearls that her immortal brother had given her were.\n\n\"I have a counteroffer Lord Uncle. I will get your Helm back from Ares and return it to you.\"\n\nHades started to sit up and Percy quickly used the pearls. As they vanished from the Underworld Percy heard her uncle curse out her father and his little tricks.\n\nAgonized on how to portray Hades. Did not want to do the book version. I went with a blend of his mythological self and the series version. I hope I did ok. Let me know, please!\n\nPercy has a conversation and an altercation with her currently least favorite cousin\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nThe pearls created by her father exploded in viridian light at their feet, bringing a delightful burst of fresh saltwater breeze. They were encased in milky white spheres, very much resembling pearls. Percy felt as if she were journeying at high speed through the ether. She recalled what Crocus had once told Hyacithus. What belongs to the sea will always return to the sea.\n\n \n\nThe spheres broke through the ocean floor and they moved upwards extremely fast. Percy looked at her son and Lee. Poor Lee looked rather queasy but Will seemed delighted with the water.\n\n \n\nThey burst through the surface of the water, right in the middle of Santa Monica Bay, where Triton had appeared to give them the pearls. Lee's sphere knocked a surfer of his board.\n\n \n\n\"Dudes!\" the surfer cried out, quickly grabbing hold of his board.\n\n \n\nPercy tried to brag Will first but he swam like a fish toward a buoy. She recalled what Lee had told her about Will's misadventure a year and a half ago. Will had definitely inherited more from her than Icarus had inherited from Neucrate. Percy grabbed Lee and dragged him to the life buoy. Percy noticed a shark lingering by, a magnificent great white nearly eleven feet long. Percy smiled at the shark.\n\n \n\n\"Lady?\" The shark moved closer to her.\n\n \n\nPercy held out her hand and gently patted the shark.\n\n \n\n\"We are fine. Don't worry.\"\n\n \n\nShe felt the creature's delight and smiled.\n\n \n\n\"You should not be this close to the shore. Especially if you see human settlements nearby. Humans are very afraid of sharks and their fear makes them violent. You could get hurt.\"\n\n \n\nPercy calculated a distance that would be safe and sent the mental image to the shark.\n\n \n\n\"I see, My Lady.\" The shark sounded chastised. Like a little kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.\n\n \n\n\"Also beware of boats.\" Percy told the great white.\n\n \n\n\"You might want to leave. It is going to get dangerous here.\"\n\n \n\nThe shark hesitated but Percy firmly pointed to the open sea and with great reluctance and one final glance the shark swam away. Percy swam toward Will and Lee, ignoring the surfer screeching about being slipped halucinogenic mushrooms in his dinner. She rolled her eyes as the surfer paddled his board away. She discreetly manipulated the water to get him to the shore quicker.\n\n \n\n\"Mom!\" Will cried out in delight.\n\n \n\nPercy looked at him. During her conversation with the shark her son had gotten off the life buoy and was now int he water.\n\n \n\n\"I can breathe underwater!\" Will's joy was evident and Percy could not help but smile back. Lee looked stupefied in his life buoy.\n\n \n\nPercy used her abilities to rush them all to the shore and to Santa Monica Pier. She could see huge plumes of smoke in the distance and hear multiple types of sirens. Police, ambulances and firetrucks. She wondered what on Olympus had happened.\n\n \n\n\"I can't believe that it was Ares!\" Lee exclaimed once they were safely in land.\n\n \n\n\"It was more of Athena's wheelhouse.\" He continued, making Percy snort.\n\n \n\n\"While Athena just loves getting my father in trouble, she is also terrified that her own father will eat her again if she steps too much of of line. Why do you think she is constantly sucking up to him?\"\n\n \n\nLee raised an eyebrow.\"What about the Olympian Riot? She was part of it, wasnt she?\"\n\n \n\nPercy gave a bitter laugh at that.\"That was a trap to get Zeus to stop trusting his brother and his most powerful child, Apollo. Getting Hera too was a huge bonus. Really cemented her position with that one move. Apollo and Poseidon realised it right after but by then it was too late.\"\n\n \n\nLee grimaced.\n\n \n\n\"Still, we are left with Zeus' Bolt. Hades at least knows that neither I or my father are involved but he might still go to war to recover his Helm. Without proof, Zeus will not believe that it was Ares.\"With that reminder Percy clutched the camera that she had taken from WATERLAND.\n\n \n\n\"So, what do we do?\" Will asked, his tan complexion rather pale.\n\n \n\nPercy looked at him.\n\n \n\n\"First thing. You and Lee go to a safe distance and I will try and reason with the war god.\"\n\n \n\nWill looked like he wanted to protest but Lee picked him up and started carrying him away with a nod to Percy.\n\n \n\nPercy started walking to the lone figure in the distance. On the way she dropped her bag, ensuring that the camera was turned on and camouflaged by the bag.\n\n \n\n\"Hey, princess,\" Ares mocked, smirking down at her with an incredulous smile as if he could nto believe that she was still alive.\"You were supposed to die.\"\n\n \n\nPercy looked at Sparta's patron god.\n\n \n\n\"It was you behind the theft of the bolt. You did all this and framed Poseidon. You stole both the Bolt and the Helm!\" She spoke up in a fairly high voice, acting the part of the indignant victim of a frame job.\n\n \n\nAres laughed with genuine pleasure.\"Well, now. I didn't steal them in person. Gods can't take each other's sympons of powers. But you are not the only demigod that can be sent to fetch things and run errands.\"\n\n \n\n\"Was it Luke Castellan from the Hermes Cabin that you used? He gave Lee cursed shoes that almost dragged him down to Tartarus.\"\n\n \n\nUp here, a safe distance from the Underworld and it's sinister basement, she felt free to utter the name of the Pit.\n\n \n\nAres seemed amused.\n\n \n\n\"That might have been his name, yes. But it doesn't matter. The point is, princess, you are getting in the way of war. You have to die in the Underworld so that golden bastard, his bitch twin and Old Seeweed can get furious at Hades for killing you. Last time you died, the golden bastard caused the downfall of an entire age and that was with the hope that he would get you back one day. Now he has no hope of ever doing so.\"\n\n \n\nAres reached into his pocked. Percy jumped back and brandished Riptide, which prompted another laugh from Ares. But what he took out was a ski cap, a staple for all sort of criminals looking to hide their identity. Percy narrowed her eyes as they cap transformed into a highly elaborate bronze war helmet. She could feel the power emanating from Hades' symbol of power.\n\n \n\n\"The Helm of Darkness,\" She spoke, nodding slightly at the item, thankful that the way she dropped her bag would have a clear view of it.\n\n \n\n\"Indeed,\" Ares bragged.\n\n \n\n\"Where was I? Ah, yes! Hades will be furious at both Poseidon and Zeus because he still does not know who took this. Very soon we will have one glorious three way divine war between the Sons of Kronos.\"Percy glared at him.\n\n \n\n\"There is a flaw in that plan, Lord Ares,\" She spat out lord as if it was an insult.\n\n \n\nHe gave her a look of disbelief.\n\n \n\n\"What would that be, princess?\"\n\n \n\nPercy snorted in laughter.\n\n \n\n\"I already spoke to Hades and I swore on the Styx that I was not the one to steal either the Bolt or the Helm. Our uncle knows that the bag that has the Bolt was given to me by you. He knows that it was you.\"\n\n \n\nThat wiped the smirk of the god's face but he recovered quickly.\n\n \n\n\"It does not matter. Who will believe Hades? He has been banned from Olympus since the Trojan war, only tolerated during Winter Solstice. He is just an outsider!\"\n\n \n\nPercy gave him a look of disbelief.\n\n \n\n\"And given your actions, don't you think that you could end up an outsider just like him?\"\n\n \n\n\"Sure, you might get your divine war which will collapse Western Civilisation to ashes. But you are part of the Western Civilization. The war might enrich and empower you for a while, but once the war is done, you will end up just as you started, if not even worse.\"\n\n \n\n\"Really? And why is that princess?\"\n\n \n\nPercy moved closer.\n\n \n\n\"Because war is a waste. Of lives, resources and energy. Once it is over all that is left is destruction that must be rebuild. After a large scale war, there is a along enforced period of peace since there are no more resources to keep on fighting. How long has it been since World War II that there was any sort of majour war? I don't mean regional trouble or civil war, but an actual, prolonged war involing more than two governments?\"\n\n \n\nAres glared at her twitching.\n\n \n\n\"And you know it. Most people can't stomach the horrors and devastations of war. After your war is over, there is going to be peace for a very, very long time. If the utter destruction of civilization doesn't drag Olympus to Khaos. Which can very well happen. There is a prophecy about that even.\"\n\n \n\nPercy almost jumped when she received a mental command from Apollo.\n\n \n\n\"Keep stalling him my love!\"\n\n \n\nPercy lilted her head. She needed to get some sort of confirmation about Kronos. Hades was reasonable and would at least be on guard from being reported a demigod dream, but Zeus would not.\n\n \n\n\"I am curious about one thing. Why send the Bolt to Hades?\"\n\n \n\nAres twitched again.\n\n \n\n\"What?\" He asked, as if having trouble believing it himself.\"Why send the Bolt to Hades. Why not keep such a powerful weapon yourself? Why would the god of war give away a weapon? Doesn't it go against your nature?\"\n\n \n\nAres looked at her stupified. He twitched again. For a moment, he seemed to be listening to something else. Percy's hand that was not holding Riptide balled into a fist.\n\n \n\n\"Why didn't I?\" The god of war asked himself.\n\n \n\n\"That kind of power? Why did I give it away?\"\n\n \n\nHe continued twitching and Percy held her breath, hoping that he would come to his senses. Then he shook his head, glaring at her with fire in his eyes.\n\n \n\n\"I did not want the trouble. Better to use it to frame you and get Hades to kill you.\"Percy laughed.\n\n \n\n\"You know, Lord Ares, you sound like you are lying to yourself.\" She looked at him with pity.\n\n \n\n\"Sending the bolt in the underworld was not your idea. It never was.\" Percy hated having to stall the most volatile of the gods.\n\n \n\n\"Of course it was my idea!\" He literally started smoking as he gnashed his teeth.\n\n \n\n\"You didn't order theft in the first place.\" Percy continued. The servant of Kronos had been caught and Kronos had to interfere after all. And the shoes that Luke had given Lee were enchanted to drag them to Tartarus, where Kronos dwelled as a pile of shredded ichory bits.\"Someone else sent a demigod to steal the two items. Then, when Zeus sent you and the rest of his Olympian children to hunt down the thief, you caught him. Naturally, as the god of war you are the best at finding a weapon.\" A bit of flattery would not go amiss. No version of her had ever met a god who disliked flattery. Even Artemis, was not immune.\"But for some reason, you didn't had the thief and the items over to Zeus. Something that would have made you his favorite child for at least a couple of millennials. Even Athena would have been pushed aside in your favor had you done so.\"\n\n \n\nAres looked at her with a look of horror in his face, as if just realising the missed opportunity. Percy ruthlessly pressed on.\n\n \n\n\"Something stoped you from turning in the thief and the bolt. Someone who wanted the Bolt to end up in Tartarus. You held on to the hot potato which would get you incriminated until another demigod came along, one that you could frame.\"\n\n \n\nAres snarled.\n\n \n\n\"I am the God of War! I take direction from no one! I don't have dreams!\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled, pleased at the reaction.\n\n \n\n\"I did not say anything about dreams? Why are you talking about dreams? Unless I am misremembering what Apollo told me once ago, gods don't dream. Unless of course another deity with domains relevant to mental manipulation is influencing them. That or they are having a prophetic vision. But you have no connection to the domain of prophecy.\"\n\n \n\nAres was visibly sweating but he quickly collected himself.\"Never mind your little theories princes. You are alive and you have the Bolt. I can't let you get back to Olympus. You might just stop those stubborn idiots from going to war. I can't let that happen.\"\n\n \n\nAres snapped his fingers in a desultory manner. Percy put Riptide back in hairpin form and tapped the pearl in her ring, transforming it into a trident. A spear would be a better choice, but a trident was better than a sword for boar killing.The ferocious animal charged her. Percy willed some seawater to snake around the beasts' hooves and quickly threw her trident at it's neck, striking it dead.\n\n \n\nPercy Jackson stood on the sands of Santa Monica Beach, her chest heaving as she stared down at the massive boar she had just slain. The trident in her hand dripped with the creature's blood, and she could feel the adrenaline coursing through her veins. She turned her gaze to Ares, the god of war, who watched her with a mixture of amusement and irritation.\n\n \n\n\"You think a boar can kill me, Ares?\" Percy called out, her voice steady despite the pounding of her heart.\"I was a Spartan Prince in my first life. I used to hunt boars for sport. Save them for your girlfriend's lovers.\"\n\n \n\nAres' eyes narrowed, and a slow, dangerous smile spread across his face.\n\n \n\n\"Is that so, little girl? Then let's see how you handle this.\"\n\n \n\nWith a flick of his wrist, a massive two-handed sword materialized in his grasp. He lunged at her with a roar, the blade slicing through the air with deadly precision.\n\n \n\nPercy dropped the trident and reached up to her hair, pulling out a simple hairpin. In an instant, it transformed into the familiar form of Riptide, her trusty sword. She met Ares' attack head-on, the clash of their weapons ringing out across the beach.\n\n \n\nAres was stronger, his blows heavier and more forceful. But Percy had the memories of her past lives--Prince Hyacinthus, Icarus, --guiding her movements. She had regularly spared with Apollo on both previous lives and with Artemis in her second. Unlike them, Ares definitely was trying to do her harm, and even take her life, but the experience was greatly helpful. She ducked and weaved, using her smaller size and speed to her advantage. Each time Ares swung his sword, she was already moving, anticipating his next move.\n\n \n\nThe trident lay forgotten in the sand, its hollow interior filled with sacred salt waters. As Percy dodged another powerful strike, she reached out with her mind, calling the trident to her. It responded instantly, flying into her hand just as she leaped to avoid a blow meant to bisect her.\n\n \n\nAres' eyes widened in surprise as she switched weapons mid-air. The trident's prongs glinted in the sunlight as she drove it into his abdomen. He staggered back, a look of shock and pain on his face. Golden ichor poured from the wound. The god looked at it in disbelief.\n\n \n\n\"You... little... brat,\" Ares growled, clutching at the wound. He raised his sword to retaliate, but before he could strike, a brilliant light filled the beach.\n\n \n\nApollo, Artemis, and Poseidon appeared, their divine presence overwhelming. Apollo and Artemis moved swiftly, their movements synchronized as they subdued Ares and clapped him in chains.\n\n \n\n\"That's enough, Ares,\" Apollo said, his voice a deadly wrathful calm that promised and eternity of pain and suffering. His golden eyes blazed like miniature suns\n\n \n\n\"You've caused enough trouble for one day.\"\n\n \n\nArtemis nodded in agreement, her silver eyes flashing with nearly as much anger as Apollo's.\n\n \n\n\"You should know better than to harm Apollo's true love. And my own adopted child.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon approached Percy, his expression a mixture of pride and concern.\n\n \n\n\"Are you alright, my daughter?\"Percy nodded, though she could feel the exhaustion setting in.\n\n \n\n\"I'm fine, Dad. Just a little tired.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon placed a hand on her shoulder, his touch comforting. She could almost close her eyes and be back in Sparta with Amyclas or back in Crete with Daedalus. Despite Zeus' laws and his own godly perception of time, Poseidon might make a fairly good dad.\n\n \n\n\"Let's get you to safety.\" He told her.\n\n \n\nAs they walked away from the beach, Percy glanced back at Ares, who was still struggling against his chains. Apollo took that as an excuse to use him for a punching bag. Percy suppressed a smirk, using her courtly experience to keep a blank expression. Poseidon had no such compunction. He laughed at his nephew's misfortune. Then again, Poseidon had been called a thief for six months.\"Was the recording live?\" She asked her father.\n\n \n\nPoseidon nodded.\n\n \n\n\"Yes. Hephaestus kept an eye on his camera. He ensured that every screen on Olympus projected Ares' confession.\"Poseidon waved a hand and Percy's bag flew up to him. He took the camera and made it disappear.\n\n \n\n\"It is better to be prompt when returning a god's property. And don't forget to burn a few sizable offerings to Hephaestus.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled.\n\n \n\n\"I will dad, I will.\"\n\n \n\n\"Very well, lets get your son and the other one.\"\n\n \n\n\"His name is Lee.\"\n\nAres did not like the Adonis reference. If he and Hades have one thing in common is their everlasting hatred towards Adonis.\n\nThe Helmet is returned to it's rightful owner. Posiedon and Hades have fun messing with mortals. Five gods and three demigods go to Olympus.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nAs they walked towards where her son Will and his brother Lee Fletcher were waiting, Percy noticed something glinting in the sand. She bent down and picked up the Helm of Darkness.\n\nPoseidon's eyes widened as he saw the helm. He looked into the distance, and Percy followed his gaze to see Hades approaching on a chariot, the three Furies flying behind him and an army of skeletons in tow.\n\n \n\n\"Stay back,\" Poseidon growled, his expression growing angry.\n\n \n\nPercy decided that de escalation was what this situation called for and hurried forward instead, stepping around the undead horses to offer her godly uncle his helm back.\n\n \n\n\"Here, Uncle Hades,\" she said, holding out the helm.\n\n \n\nHades snatched it from her hand, his eyes narrowing. Percy had a feeling that he had been expecting to fight for his own symbol of power.\n\n \n\n\"Poseidon,\" he sneered,\n\n \n\n\"Hades,\" Poseidon replied.\n\n \n\n\"Instead of kidnapping Sally, you could have just talked to me.\"\n\n \n\nHades bristled. \"When was the last time you even deigned to talk to me, Poseidon?\"\n\n \n\n\"We spoke right before I entrusted Percy to the care of an Oceanid,\" Poseidon retorted.\n\n \n\nPercy interjected,\n\n \n\n\"I met Galaxaura when I was five years old. I'm twelve now, almost thirteen. It's been more than seven years.\"\n\n \n\n\"That's no time at all,\" Poseidon said dismissively.\n\n \n\nPercy rolled her eyes at the way gods perceived time and turned to reunite with Will and Lee. As she walked away, she heard sirens in the distance and stopped.\n\n \n\n\"Why is LA in flames?\" she asked Hades.\n\n \n\n\"Ares caused a fair bit of destruction to frame me further,\" Hades replied.\n\n \n\nPercy hurried to Will as Poseidon and Hades began to argue again. She knew that despite the chaos, she had to stay strong for her family and for the world that depended on her. But now, for something more important. She needed to reassure her son that everything would be fine.\n\n \n\nPercy hurried to Will as Poseidon and Hades began to argue again. Lee had been holding on to Will to ensure that the eight-year-old boy did not go running toward his mother in the danger zone. They were both visibly relieved to see Percy unharmed. Percy immediately hugged Will and dragged Lee into the hug too.\n\n \n\n\"I'm so glad you're okay, Mom,\" Will said, his voice muffled against her shoulder.\n\n \n\nLee nodded, tears slipping out of his eyes.\n\n \n\n\"I thought it was over.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled, though her eyes were serious.\n\n \n\n\"It won't be over until we give Zeus back his lost sparkler.\"\n\n \n\nLee laughed at her phrasing, but the tension in his shoulders eased. They sat down on the sand, watching Apollo beat up Ares and occasionally glancing at Poseidon and Hades, who were still arguing.\n\n \n\nThe sound of approaching sirens grew louder, and Percy saw the mortal police and rescue personnel heading their way. She had no idea how to deal with them, so she called out to her dad and pointed to the approaching officers. Poseidon heard her and went to greet the officers. Not wanting to be left out, Hades followed him.\n\n \n\nPercy, Will, and Lee watched as the two gods manipulated the mortals. Poseidon started by playing the part of the angry father, whose daughter was kidnapped and the police, instead of trying to rescue her, accused her of having something to do with her mother's disappearance and accused her of terrorist acts when she kept trying to escape her kidnappers. The officers were unable to get a word in.\n\n \n\nHades added his two cents.\n\n \n\n\"I was minding my own business when my niece and the other two kidnapped children arrived in my home, chased by an insane madman. I had to get in touch with my estranged brother so we could hire some private security to do your job.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon even asked the police, \"Why do we even pay you taxes for?\"\n\n \n\nThat classic line of Karens everywhere.\n\n \n\nPercy, Will, and Lee started to giggle. Percy pointed out,\n\n \n\n\"For having such a terrible relationship, Hades and Poseidon sure put on an Oscar-worthy act together.\"\n\n \n\nWill nodded, his eyes wide with admiration.\n\n \n\n\"They're really good at this.\"\n\n \n\nLee grinned.\"Yeah, they are.\"\n\n \n\nAs the gods continued their performance, Percy felt a sense of relief wash over her. Despite the chaos and danger, she knew she had her family by her side, and together, they could face anything.\n\n \n\nOne of the officers asked if they could interrogate Percy and the other two kidnapped children, Will and Lee. Poseidon denied them permission.\n\n \n\n\"I will never allow the likes of you to interrogate my daughter who had to fight a kidnapper because of your uselessness.\" He snarled, making the officer step back and flinch.\n\n \n\n\"Also, Will is my grandson and Lee my grandnephew. All three are minors and can't be interrogated without the leave of a parent or guardian. I am their guardian right now, and I will not allow you to traumatize them further.\"\n\n \n\nThe gods ensured that the mortals couldn't see Ares, Apollo, and Artemis by the shore. Hades told the police,\n\n \n\n\"The culprit unfortunately escaped on a motorboat, but Percy managed to wrestle the gun from him and shot him in the abdomen. You need to look for a tall man with an abdominal gun wound.\"\n\n \n\nThe police and rescue personnel were forced to leave. Poseidon approached the three demigods.\n\n \n\n\"We need to get to Olympus.\"\n\n \n\nPercy picked up the bag that still had Zeus' bolt in it. Poseidon held out his hand for it. Percy hesitated.\n\n \n\n\"Is it a good idea for you to hold on to it?\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon nodded.\n\n \n\n\"We need to get concessions from Zeus. He will be more cooperative if I am holding his beloved symbol of power.\"\n\n \n\nTo Percy's surprise, Hades agreed.\n\n \n\n\"Give the bolt to your father.\"\n\n \n\nPercy handed the bolt to Poseidon. The two gods and the three demigods then went to the shore to join Apollo, Artemis, and the chained-up Ares. Apollo stopped kicking Ares and turned to Percy, Will, and Lee.\n\n \n\n\"Close your eyes and keep them closed until I tell you to open them.\"\n\n \n\nThe three demigods obeyed, trusting in the gods to handle the rest.\n\n \n\nPercy, Will and Lee kept their eyes tightly shut as instructed by Apollo. The teleportation to Olympus had been swift, and now they awaited Apollo's signal to open their eyes. The air around them buzzed with divine energy, and Percy could feel the presence of the gods surrounding them.\n\n \n\n\"Alright, you can open your eyes now,\" Apollo's voice rang out.\n\n \n\nPercy opened her eyes and gasped. Olympus was more magnificent than she had ever imagined. Towering marble columns, golden palaces, and lush gardens stretched out before her. The sky was a brilliant shade of blue, and the air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers. She looked around in awe, taking in the grandeur of the home of the gods.\n\n \n\nApollo smiled at her reaction, his eyes twinkling with amusement. Will and Lee, having attended Winter Solstice Parties before, were less impressed but still respectful of their surroundings. Percy noticed that Hades' Palace, back in the Underworld, bore a striking resemblance to Olympus, though it had a darker, more somber aura.\n\n \n\nAs they walked, they attracted the attention of many gods and nature spirits. Whispers and gasps followed them, and Percy could hear snippets of conversation about her.\n\n \n\n\"Is that her? Hyacinthus reborn?\"\n\n \n\n\"She's so small!\"\n\n \n\n\"That's the one who exposed Ares!\"\n\n \n\nShe ignored the gossip and focused on the task at hand.\n\n \n\nPoseidon, clutching Zeus's Bolt, led the procession with Hades by his side. Ares, in chains, was dragged along by Artemis, while Apollo kept an arrow notched and aimed at the war god. Percy gathered Will closer to her, ready to protect him if necessary.\n\n \n\nBefore confronting Ares at Santa Monica Beach, Percy had turned on one of Hephaestus's cameras she had taken from WATERLAND. According to her father, Hephaestus ensured that the live footage was transmitted on every screen on Olympus, TVs, personal computers, and cellphones. Everyone saw Ares confess to stealing the Bolt and the Helm to start a three-way divine war that would have seen civilization and possibly Olympus itself destroyed. They also saw Percy fight with Ares and stab him in the abdomen with a trident.\n\n \n\nSeveral gods pointed out how small and young Percy was, but she ignored them and walked with determination. Poseidon and Hades were at the head of their little procession, with Poseidon very pointedly holding onto Zeus's Bolt. The divine twins, Apollo and Artemis, followed after the eldest sons of Kronos, with Ares between them, still chained. They allowed Ares to walk under his own power rather than drag him behind.\n\n \n\nPercy, Will, and Lee were right after the younger Olympians. Percy and Lee flanked Will, ready to cover him if needed. As they approached the throne room, the doors swung open, revealing the majestic hall where Zeus awaited them.\n\n \n\nZeus sat on his throne, his expression stern as he watched the procession enter. Hera stood beside him, her eyes narrowing as she took in the sight of Ares in chains. She also eyed the abdominal wound, still oozing golden ichor. The other gods were gathered around, their faces a mix of curiosity, amusement and concern. Athena though was very studiously neutral. Percy briefly met the eyes of the goddess of strategic warfare, who had missed every single clue and failed to stop this mess.\n\n \n\nPoseidon stepped forward, holding up Zeus's Bolt for everyone to see.\n\n \n\n\"Brother, we have retrieved your Bolt and apprehended the one responsible for its theft.\"\n\n \n\nZeus's eyes flickered with anger as he looked at Ares.\n\n \n\n\"You have much to answer for, Ares.\"\n\n \n\nAres glared defiantly but remained silent. Artemis tightened her grip on his chains, and Apollo kept his arrow trained on him.\n\n \n\nHades stepped forward next, holding his Helm of Darkness.\n\n \n\n\"I have also recovered my Helm, thanks to Percy Jackson.\"\n\n \n\nZeus's gaze shifted to Percy, and for a moment, she felt the weight of his scrutiny.\n\n \n\n\"You have done well, Percy Jackson. You have prevented a great disaster.\" He told her with clenched teeth.\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, feeling a mix of relief and pride.\n\n \n\n\"I only did what needed to be done.\"\n\n \n\nZeus turned his attention back to Ares.\n\n \n\n\"You will be judged for your actions, Ares. But for now, you will remain in chains.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon, not missing the opportunity, spoke up.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus, you accused me of stealing the Bolt without any proof. It turns out it was your own son who committed the theft.\"\n\n \n\nAres, trying to defend himself, said, \"I was influenced. It was Kronos--\"\n\n \n\n\"Be quiet!\" Zeus thundered. \"I will not hear any talk of Kronos returning. Don't make up nonsense to cover up your misdeeds, boy!\"\n\n \n\nHades snorted in disbelief.\n\n \n\n\"Zeus, you have no say in the Underworld. And you need to compensate me for the theft of my Helm of Darkness, by your sole legitimate son.\"\n\n \n\nPoseidon added,\n\n \n\n\"And I need concessions for being called a thief since Winter Solstice.\"\n\n \n\nZeus looked at his brothers, frustration evident on his face.\n\n \n\n\"We will discuss this further. For now, let us deal with Ares.\"\n\n \n\nPercy, sensing an opportunity, asked,\n\n \n\n\"Has anything been done about Luke Castellan, the main suspect for the person who physically stole the Bolt and the Helm?\"\n\n \n\nZeus's attention was on his Bolt, in Poseidon's hands. Hermes spoke up,\n\n \n\n\"It could not possibly be my son.\"\n\n \n\nPercy interjected,\n\n \n\n\"Luke is a very talented thief, has access to an item that grants invisibility, Annabeth Chase's invisibility cap, and he also gave us a pair of flying shoes, which nearly dragged Lee into Tartarus.\"\n\n \n\nHermes, realizing the truth in Percy's words, insisted,\"Luke must have been threatened by Ares.\"\n\n \n\nAthena objected,\n\n \n\n\"My daughter would never be involved in such a scheme.\"\n\n \n\nPercy resisted the urge to roll her eyes at Athena and replied,\n\n \n\n\"Annabeth has a huge crush on Luke. All he would need to get the cap from her is to ask.\"\n\n \n\nZeus decided,\n\n \n\n\"I will send the Dioscuri, the immortalized demigod twins I had with Queen Leda of Sparta, to capture Luke Castellan for questioning.\"\n\n \n\nPercy and Hera made identical expressions of displeasure at the mention of the Dioscuri. Hera, because they were products of Zeus cheating on her, and Percy, because she used to be Hyacinthus, Sparta's heir to the throne and Crown Prince. Sparta should have been inherited by Hyacinthus's son with Apollo, Asclepius, not gone to a daughter of Zeus with not a single drop of King Lelex's bloodline.\n\n \n\nSensing the rising tensions, Apollo took Percy, Will, and Lee away from the Hall of the Gods. Once they left the throne room, he turned to Percy with a smile.\n\n \n\n\"Clio and Asclepius are waiting to meet you.\"\n\n \n\nPercy gasped and jumped with delight. She was eager to meet her mother and her firstborn son. Will also shared her excitement, as he had not been able to freely interact with his godly grandmother and brother due to Zeus's restrictions. Lee followed them, not wanting to be left behind on Olympus but also looking rather unsure if he should go with them. Percy just gestured him to come along. Lee was Asclepius' brother too. Clio had always been fond of Hyacinthus' friends and after this horrendous quest, Lee was definitely a friend.\n\nShort chapter I know, but it just wanted to come out of me. Can't wait to write about Percy's reunion with her first mother and her firstborn son. Clio and Asclepius have been waiting for so long. Asclepius for his entire immortal life.\n\nHades to the mortal police: I did not go low contact with my terrible family so my niece would need to come to me because as usual police were useless.\n\nA long awaited reunion. A crowning and an nice family dinner.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nThe weight of Percy recent quest still hung heavy on her shoulders, but today was different. Today, Apollo was taking her, Will, and Lee to see Clio, her mother in her first life, and Asclepius, Hyacinthus' firstborn son with Apollo.\n\n \n\nPercy was nervous. She hadn't seen Clio since her first life as Hyacinthus, and she had never met Clio during her second life as Icarus. The thought of facing her mother again after so many lifetimes filled her with a mix of excitement and dread. To settle her nerves, she turned to Apollo, who was walking beside her, his golden aura radiating warmth and reassurance.\n\n \n\n\"Apollo,\" Percy began, her voice trembling slightly, \"why didn't Icarus ever meet Clio?\"\n\n \n\nApollo was silent for a moment, his expression thoughtful. \"There were several reasons,\" he finally said. \"First, I was afraid of what Clio's reaction would be. She was deeply grieved by Hyacinthus' death, and I didn't want to cause her more pain. Second, Artemis partially raised Icarus and came to see herself as his mother. She was adverse to sharing that role. And third, Icarus might have grown suspicious. I was uncertain if the rules of death allowed for a reincarnated person to know who they once were.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, absorbing Apollo's words.\n\n \n\n\"And Asclepius?\" she asked. \"Why didn't Icarus ever meet him?\"\n\n \n\n\"For the same reason,\" Apollo replied.\n\n \n\n\"It would have been hard for Asclepius to have his mortal parent not recognize him as a son.\"\n\n \n\nPercy sighed, but she realized that Apollo was right. The situation was too complex.\n\n \n\n\"In all my lives, I've been fond of your children, not just the ones that were also mine,\" she said softly.\n\n \n\n\"Icarus would have liked Asclepius.\"\n\n \n\nApollo smiled, his eyes filled with warmth.\n\n \n\n\"I believe he would have,\" he said.\n\n \n\n\"And I know Asclepius would have liked Icarus.\"\n\n \n\nAs they approached the palace, Percy noticed that the gardens were filled with hyacinth flowers, their sweet fragrance filling the air. She felt a strange sense of familiarity, as if she had been here before. The garden was adorned with several statues of Hyacinthus, each one capturing a different moment of his life. Percy felt a pang of sadness as she realized that these statues were of her, from a life long past.\n\n \n\nThey entered the palace, and Percy was struck by the beauty of the tapestries, murals, and paintings that adorned the walls. Each one depicted scenes from her life as Hyacinthus. She saw herself playing the lyre, laughing with Apollo, and even the tragic moment of her death. It was overwhelming, and Percy felt a lump form in her throat.\n\n \n\nAs they walked through the halls, Percy recognized several of her belongings from her life as Prince Hyacinthus. There was a pythos showing Apollo slaying the python, a statue of Clio that Hyacinthus had commissioned when he was eleven years old, and a carved wooden desk that she had used to write letters to Apollo. It was as if time had stood still, preserving these memories for eternity.\n\n \n\nPercy realized that this palace was less the home of the Muse of History and more of a shrine entombing the memory of Hyacinthus. It was not a healthy way to grieve, and Percy felt a deep sadness for Clio. She had never borne a child except Hyacinthus, and it was clear that she had never moved on from his death.\n\n \n\nApollo noticed Percy's sadness and placed a comforting hand on her shoulder.\n\n \n\n\"Clio has never been able to let go,\" he said softly. \"She loved Hyacinthus deeply, and his death shattered her.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, tears welling up in her eyes.\n\n \n\n\"I understand,\" she whispered. \"But she needs to move on. Hyacinthus as I was wouldn't want her to be trapped in the past like this. I am reborn but things can't go back to the way they were. The world has changed too much.\"\n\n \n\nApollo smiled sadly. \"You're right, Percy. Perhaps you can help her find peace.\"\n\n \n\nThey continued through the palace until they reached a grand hall where Clio sat, surrounded by scrolls and books. She looked up as they entered, her eyes widening in shock as she saw Percy.\n\n \n\n\"Hyacinthus?\" she whispered, her voice trembling.\n\n \n\nPercy stepped forward, her heart aching for the woman before her.\n\n \n\n\"No, Mother. It's me, Percy. But I remember. I remember everything.\"\n\n \n\nClio's eyes filled with tears as she stood and embraced Percy.\n\n \n\n\"My child,\" she sobbed. \"I've missed you so much.\"\n\n \n\n\"Percy,\" Clio said, her voice trembling with emotion. \"It's been so long.\"\n\n \n\nPercy took a deep breath and stepped forward, her eyes meeting Clio's.\n\n \n\n\"It has,\" she replied, her voice steady.\n\n \n\n\"But I'm here now.\"\n\n \n\nClio's eyes filled with tears as she reached out to embrace Percy.\n\n \n\n\"I've missed you so much,\" she whispered.\n\n \n\n\"I've missed you too,\" Percy replied, her own eyes filling with tears.\n\n \n\n\"In every life, I've missed you.\"\n\n \n\nAs they held each other, Percy felt a sense of peace wash over her. She was finally home, reunited with her mother and her son. The journey had been long and difficult, but it had led her to this moment, and for that, she was grateful.\n\n \n\nAs they stood there, surrounded by the memories of the past, Percy felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that this was just the beginning of a new chapter, one where she could honor her past while embracing her future. And with Apollo, Will, Lee, and Clio by her side, she knew that she would never be alone.\n\n \n\nJust as Percy was about to speak, another god entered the hall. He had golden curls just like Apollo and Will, and amethyst eyes that mirrored Hyacinthus'. Percy's breath caught in her throat. She knew who he was.\n\n \n\n\"Asclepius,\" she whispered, her voice trembling with emotion.\n\n \n\nThe god, who looked no older than twelve, smiled warmly.\n\n \n\n\"Mother,\" he said softly.\n\n \n\nPercy's eyes filled with tears as she called out to her firstborn son, the son she never got to meet because Asclepius was born after her first death. She rushed forward and embraced him tightly. Asclepius eagerly returned her embrace, and both of them wept in each other's arms.\n\n \n\nEventually, they let go, and Percy cradled Asclepius' face to look at him. He had the same eyes Hyacinthus had. The exact same shade of purple, the exact same shape and even his eyelashes seemed to be just the same. His smile was still the same that Percy had, that Will had. That Alexios once had. Apollo truly made the most perfect children.\n\n \n\n\"Why do you look so young?\" she asked, her voice filled with wonder.\n\n \n\nAsclepius smiled gently.\n\n \n\n\"My usual middle-aged appearance would be too alien and incomprehensible to you given your tender age,\" he explained.\n\n \n\nPercy frowned and shook her head.\n\n \n\n\"You are my son. I already love you just for existing. You don't have to change or alter yourself for me.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius' smile widened.\n\n \n\n\"I like being young. I've struck a friendship with Hebe, the goddess of youth, and I'm realizing just how much fun youthfulness is.\"\n\n \n\nPercy smiled, her heart swelling with love and pride.\n\n \n\n\"I'm delighted that you are happy,\" she said softly.\n\n \n\nAs they stood together, surrounded by the memories of the past and the promise of the future, Percy knew that she had found a new sense of purpose. With her family by her side, she was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\n \n\nPercy turned to Clio.\n\n \n\n\"Some time ago, Apollo told me that among my' belongings that you confiscated and preserved was the Crown of Lelex, which was given to me by my first father, King Amyclas, to formalize and ratify my' position as heir to the Spartan throne and future king of Sparta. Unfortunately, I died before I could become king, and my firstborn son and heir was denied his rightful inheritance due to the circumstances. I ask you now, Mother, for the Crown of Lelex so I can fix the great wrong done to my son.\"\n\n \n\nClio immediately retrieved the crown. Percy removed the ancient gold crown from the box it was kept in and approached Asclepius. She recited the oath that the chosen heir must recite before being crowned.\n\n \n\n\"I take as my own the kingdom of Laconia and its people. None shall starve that my hand can feed. None shall be slaughtered that my hand can protect.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius recited the oath after her, and she placed the crown on his head. The crown shone brightly golden, acknowledging Asclepius as the rightful heir of Sparta.\n\n \n\n\"I chose you as my heir. As Sparta's king. Forever may you reign my son.\" She told Asclepius with a smile.\n\n \n\nClio ordered her attending nymphs to prepare a table so they could all share a meal. Clio and Asclepius had quite a few questions for Percy, Will and even Lee. Percy looked at the table, it was a mix of modern and ancient dishes. She was delighted to see Spartan black broth and spiced honey cakes. She gladly took a helping of the soup but noticed Will and Lee look at it weirdly.\n\n\"You don't have to eat it if you don't want too. My ancient contemporaries were iffy about it, I know how it appears to a modern person.\"\n\n \n\nWill frowned but tentatively filled a small bowl halfway and took one tiny sip with his spoon. His eyes widened.\n\n \n\n\"It is good!\" He told her and proceeded to eat more.\n\n \n\nEmboldened by his brother, Lee filled a bowl of his own and tried it.\n\n \n\n\"Just a pork meat soup, a little boring if weird looking. Why were the Athenians so afraid of it?\" He asked.\nPercy chewed and swallowed one of the chucks of pork meat before answering Lee.\n\n \n\n\"Athenians were just babies.\" She told him, prompting a giggle from Will.\n\n \n\n\"Tell me everything about your third and current life,\" Clio said, her voice filled with warmth.\n\n \n\nPercy smiled, trying to focus on the positives.\n\n \n\n\"Well, I've had quite an adventure. I've made some amazing friends, and I've learned so much about myself and my abilities. Will and Lee have been incredible companions, and we've faced many challenges together.\"\n\n \n\nAsclepius, still wearing the crown of Lelex, joined them at the table, along with Will, Lee, and Apollo himself. The atmosphere was light and filled with laughter as they shared stories of their exploits. Percy took note of the sword that Asclepius removed and put beside his chair. Unless she was mistaken that was one of the swords she had used in Sparta between the ages of ten to thirteen, before having a growth spurt which made the sword too small to handle comfortably.\n\n \n\nHowever, Apollo's expression grew serious as he mentioned the interviews Percy's stepfather, Smelly Gabe, had given to the press.\n\n \n\n\"I've read what he said about you, Percy. I want to know the truth.\"\n\n \n\nPercy hesitated, unsure of how to phrase her response without causing Apollo to unleash another plague. She had read the articles on both Olympus Weekly and on the mortal press about the new virus that was spreading fast and terrifying the authorities. She took a deep breath, trying to find the right words. She had no doubt that Apollo and Artemis would hunt the miserable excuse for a human fairly soon, but that man was not something to discuss during a nice dinner. Hades had promised to return her mother soon and she hoped that Smelly Gabe would be gone before Sally returned to their apartment.\n\n \n\n\"Smelly Gabe... he isn't a good person. He made my life difficult, but I managed to overcome it. I don't want to dwell on the negatives. We can talk about him later. Lets not ruin a perfectly nice dinner discussing him of all people.\"\n\n \n\nJust as she was struggling to convince a stubborn looking Apollo to drop it for now, one of Clio's nymph attendants announced three arrivals. The first was Galaxaura, the Oceanid that Poseidon had tasked with keeping an eye on Percy. Galaxaura was also the head of the child model agency where Percy had worked since she was five years old. Percy rose from her chair and smle when she saw Galaxaura. She had not seen her since before the Montauk trip and had missed her agent dreadfully.\n\n \n\nWith Galaxaura was Anteros, the god of mutual love and the son of Poseidon and Nerites, making him Percy's half-brother. Anteros unfortunately looked like a carbon copy of Apollo, which was slightly disturbing. Percy looked between her half-brother and her beloved, trying to catalogue differences between the two. Physically they were identical, but their godly auras were utterly different. Apollo was bright and golden like the sun he controlled. Anteros had that rosiness of love along with a strong whiff of salt and water. The third guest was Rhodos, daughter of Poseidon and another immortal half-sibling of Percy.\n\n \n\nGalaxaura approached Percy with a warm smile. Clio's smile became rather fixed as Oceanid and demigod embraced.\n\n \n\n\"You've grown so much, Percy. It's been an honor watching over you.\"\n\n \n\nGalaxaura also noticed Clio's unease and was declaring her intent not to step on Clio's toes in regard to the maternal role in Percy's life. Percy had a feeling that Clio and Artemis would need to come to some sort of understanding, hopefully without bloodshed, because Percy really did not think that she could chose between them. At least neither goddess would see Sally, a mortal, as competition. But to be on the safe side, Percy would suggest that her mortal mother regularly sacrifice to Artemis and Clio in order to sweeten them toward her.\n\n \n\nAnteros and Rhodos also greeted Percy warmly, and the atmosphere in the hall lightened once more. Percy felt a sense of relief as the conversation shifted away from her past struggles.\n\n \n\nAs they dined together, Clio continued to ask Percy about her life. Percy decided to focus on her academic career. She explained how dyslexia and ADHD made schooling difficult for demigods, but despite that Percy had managed to maintain good grades in History, which was her favorite subject. Clio was delighted to hear that.\n\n \n\nRhodos wasted no time in addressing the room after reading some messages in her H Phone.\n\"Poseidon is still holding Zeus' bolt hostage until he and Hades get the concessions they want. Ares' actions in framing Poseidon for the theft of the bolt and for stealing Hades' helm have caused quite a stir. So far, they've managed to get Zeus to agree to leave Percy alone and not make a fuss about her being born against an oath.\"\n\n \n\nApollo's face darkened as he replied to a message from Artemis. Percy was not sure if Artemis was speaking on his behalf or if Apollo had split his consciousness to be both at the council and at dinner.\n\n \n\n\"Aphrodite just snitched that Zeus intended to have Percy undertake numerous quests to earn her right to live. Poseidon put an end to that.\"\n\n \n\nPercy glanced at Apollo, noting the anger in his eyes.\n\n \n\n\"It's a good thing Thalia Grace is a tree,\" she muttered to Lee, seated at her left.\n\n \n\n\"She wouldn't be safe from Apollo after this.\"\n\n \n\nLee glanced at his incensed father before whispering back.\n\n \n\n\"Please remind him that her tree powers our wards so he does not burn it down.\"\nApollo, obviously able to hear them, just rolled his eyes at them but he gave a brief nod to Percy. She smiled at him as she peeled some tangerines for Will and Asclepius.\nHades' banishment from Olympus had been lifted, much to the chagrin of Demeter and Hera, who had tried to disagree but were overruled by the others. Percy acutely understood why Demeter hated Hades and wanted him out of her home, but why did Hera have such a disdain for her brother? During Demeter's search for Persephone, Hera never aided her sister and she had never been fond of Persephone. Clio had once told Hyacinthus that Leto's twins and Demeter's Persephone fit Hera's criteria of 'perfect children', which caused the Queen of the Gods to resent them something fierce.\n\n \n\nPercy turned to the gods. Demeter's wrath was not something to take lightly. Last time she took umbrage, humanity almost did not survive.\n\n \n\n\"You need to find a way to make Demeter happy, or she might cause a famine. We don't need that on top of Apollo's plague.\"\n\n \n\n\"We could make some new plants for Persephone to play around with. If Persephone is happy and Hades is not involved, Demeter is happy too.\" Clio suggested.\n\n \n\nRhodos' phone buzzed, and she glanced at the screen.\n\n \n\n\"It's a message from my mother, Aphrodite. Apparently, Poseidon is trying to stop the tribute of his cyclops sons to Hephaestus. This was something decreed by Zeus thousands of years ago to ensure that Atlantis did not gain a technological edge over Olympus. Hephaestus is objecting, but Poseidon is willing to negotiate privately about internship programs for cyclopses. He just doesn't want his sons forced into indentured servitude.\"\n\n \n\nPercy raised an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n\"Aphrodite is your mother? I thought Amphitrite was.\"\n\n \n\nRhodos laughed.\n\n \n\n\"It took me centuries of bribing bards and singers to become known as a daughter of Amphitrite.\"\n\n \n\n\"Why go to such lengths?\" Percy asked.\n\n \n\n\"Aphrodite is a fairly decent mother to her immortal children, but I really dislike my half-siblings from her, especially Eros,\" Rhodos explained.\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, conceding the point. Apollo's eyes flashed a burning gold at Eros' name. Percy recalled that Eros had been the one to shelter that wind god from Apollo's wrath.\n\n \n\n\"I suppose I've never had to put up with Eros.\" Percy could not help but feel glad that Zephyrus had spent thousand of years under the whims and caprices of Eros. It might not be the dismemberment and shoving into Tartarus that Apollo had wanted, but it was still a harsh punishment.\n\n \n\nThe conversation continued, the gods and demigods discussing the delicate balance of power and the intricate web of relationships that bound them all. It made Percy realise that even of Olympus, live was not easy. She was reminded of life at Minos' court, but cranked up to the eleven. Unlike Minos, Zeus was an immortal god and thus needed to be endured and appeased for eternity.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, all the gods' phones issued an alert. Clio's nymph attendant re-entered the room, her face pale.\n\n \n\n\"Luke Castellan has been captured by the Dioscuri and brought into Olympus. However, they realized that Luke has bathed in the Styx, making him invulnerable, and his mind is shielded by strong magic. They can't interrogate him. But Luke has stated that he will speak to Percy Jackson and Will Solace.\"\n\n \n\nZeus' voice boomed through the devices, issuing a direct order.\n\n \n\n\"Percy Jackson and William Solace are to go to the holding area to interrogate Luke Castellan immediately!\"\n\n \n\nApollo immediately objected. \"I don't want Percy and Will near Luke. It's too dangerous.\"\n\n \n\nPercy stood up, her expression resolute.\n\n \n\n\"I don't want Will near him too but we cant disobey Zeus right now.\"\n\n \n\n\"Also, Luke is just one demigod in chains, even if he is a servant of Kronos. It's unlikely he'll manage to do anything. Besides, we can't ignore Zeus' direct orders. It might mess up Poseidon's and Hades' negotiations. Will will stay a fair distance away and I will interrogate the thief.\"\n\n \n\nPercy nodded, turning to Will. \"Let's go, Will. We have a demigod to interrogate.\"\n\n \n\nApollo and Asclepius stood up, intent on following Percy and Will. Percy took the hands of both Wil and Asclepius into hers and Apollo walked ahead of them. He set the pace, walking very slowly and taking his sweet time. Percy smiled at her beloved's pettiness and malicious compliance. She looked around and spotted a few gods. She recognized Hecate, Morpheus, Hypnos and Nemesis. She nodded respectfully to each god and got a slight nod of recognition back. Hecate even gave her a smile. There were a few more minor gods milling around, especially around Hecate and Morpheus. Percy idly wondered why did they find Luke's interrogation so interesting. She was fairly certain she had not seen any of them when Poseidon and Hades had ushered the people involved in the Bolt Quest toward the Hall of the Gods mere hours before.\n\nCan anyone guess what will happen next?\n\nAn interrogation is had and then a series of surprises for the gods.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nPercy stood at the edge of the grand pathway leading to the Hall of the Gods. Her heart pounded in her chest, from a strange anticipation. Beside her stood her son, Will Solace, his face a mask of determination. Apollo, her beloved, led the way, his steps deliberately slow, his displeasure evident in every movement. Asclepius, their other son, walked beside them, his eyes scanning their surroundings with curiosity.\n\nWill looked at how slowly Apollo was walking and turned to his mother.\n\n\"Mom,\" He pointed to his father. \"Why is dad walking so slowly?\"\n\nPercy's lips quirked in a slight smile.\n\n\"He is not happy about the situation and is being difficult to annoy his father.\"\n\nWill nodded, smiling a bit as well.\n\nAs they walked, Percy couldn't help but notice the gods watching them. Hecate, Morpheus, Hypnos, and Nemesis stood in the shadows, their eyes following the small procession with keen interest.\n\nPercy nudged Asclepius and whispered, \"Why do you think they're so invested in this?\"\n\nAsclepius shook his head, his brow furrowed. \"I have no idea, Mother. It's strange, though.\"\n\nApollo glanced back at them, his expression softening slightly.\n\n\"Stay close,\" he murmured. \"We're almost there.\"\n\nThe Hall of the Gods loomed ahead, its grandeur both awe-inspiring and intimidating. They entered a side chamber, where Luke Castellan was bound in chains. Hermes, Athena, and Enyo stood near him, their expressions a mix of frustration, distaste, and anger. Hermes was pleading with Luke, his voice desperate.\n\n\"Please, Luke,\" Hermes implored. \"Tell the truth. Ares threatened you to steal the Bolt and the Helm. You don't have to protect him.\"\n\nLuke's eyes blazed with utter fury as he glared at Hermes and spat. \"You ruined my life!\" he shouted. \"You were never there for me! Why should I help you now?\"\n\nAthena sighed, her voice tinged with regret. \"We can't just torture him or extract the information from his mind. His mind is shielded by strong magic.\"\nEnyo crossed her arms, her tone mocking. \"Why are you even here, Athena? You failed to figure out that Poseidon had nothing to do with the theft. This whole mess was to provoke a war on Olympus.\"\nAthena's eyes narrowed as she retorted, \"I am an enthroned Olympian, Enyo. You are just a minor goddess of war.\"\nBefore Enyo could respond, Apollo stepped forward, his voice firm. \"Both of you, shut up.\"\nLuke's gaze shifted to Apollo, then to Percy and Will standing behind him. His face twisted with hatred and dislike as he sneered,\n\"So, Zeus really sent the precious Hyacinthus and the favored little sunbeam to question me. How pathetic.\"\n\nPercy stepped forward, her voice calm but firm. \"Luke, we're not here to hurt you. We just want the truth.\"\n\nShe did not like Luke Castellan. From the first moment he reminded her too much of sly, deceitful courtiers in the royal courts of Sparta and Knossos. She could always read the rage in his eyes. But that paled to the fact that he gave Lee, someone who considered him a friend, shoes cursed to drag the wearer to Tartarus. But since Athena and Enyo had already played bad cop, it was better if she joined Hermes in playing good cop.\n\nLuke's eyes flickered with a mix of bewildering array of emotions before he looked away, his jaw clenched.\n\n\"You wouldn't understand.\"\n\nWill stepped closer to his mother, his voice calm but firm.\n\n\"Try us, Luke. We deserve to know.\"\n\nThat seemed to be a mistake, seeing Will caused something to shutter in Luke's eyes. Percy urged her son away from the chained demigod, firmly directing him to his brother. She approached Luke instead. Athena looked from Luke to Percy with a calculating glint in her grey eyes. She gave a haughty nod at Percy, silently urging her to keep asking Luke questions.\n\nPercy took a step closer, her voice soft but insistent. \"How did you get the idea of framing me for the theft?\"\n\nAthena, her curiosity piqued, added, \"Yes, boy. We need to know that too.\"\n\nLuke smirked at Athena, his contempt evident. The goddess narrowed her eyes and her lips went thin at the palpable disrespect from a mere demigod. In any other situation Percy would have quite enjoyed the sight.\n\n\"I can't believe you fell for our trap, Athena. I was afraid you'd figure things out quickly, given your domains of wisdom and strategy. But my patron told me to frame Poseidon. He said you'd be too blinded by the possibility of getting one over on Poseidon to see past your own overly large nose.\"\n\nAthena gasped in outrage, her hand briefly touching her nose. Enyo laughed at her, but Apollo intervened, his voice sharp.\n\n\"Athena, stop being vain and focus on the task.\"\n\nPercy thought that it was a bit rich of him telling someone else to stop being vain but she pressed on, her voice steady.\n\n\"Luke, how did you get the particulars of framing Poseidon? How did you find out about me?\"\n\nLuke's expression hardened as he replied,\n\n\"I overheard a FaceTime conversation between Grover and Chiron. Grover reported to Chiron that he suspected you weren't a daughter of Aphrodite as they initially assumed, but a daughter of Poseidon. He also suspected you were the third reincarnation of Hyacinthus. That's when I got the idea of framing you and Poseidon for the theft.\"\n\nPercy exchanged a glance with Apollo, who nodded in understanding. The pieces were finally falling into place.\n\nPercy took a deep breath and asked, \"Luke, how did you manage to steal the Bolt and the Helm?\"\n\nLuke's eyes darkened as he recounted, \"I made a theoretical plan years ago. I noticed how both Zeus and Hades left their symbols of power unattended during the Winter Solstice party like idiots. I asked Annabeth for her invisibility cap.\"\n\nAthena startled at that, her eyes widening. \"My daughter was involved?\"\n\nLuke shook his head. \"No, I didn't trust Annabeth enough to involve her. But she's fond of me, so I knew she'd give me the cap. She'd given it to me before for pranks. This time, I used it to steal from two god-kings. I put the cap on and stole the Helmet of Darkness first. I took it to a secluded place and swapped the cap for the Helm. Then, with the Helm on, I went to steal Zeus's Bolt. I used the Mist to confuse the demigods returning to camp and went on the run. I called Chiron to let him know I was checking on my insane mother. He didn't question it because he feels guilty about my mom.\"\n\nPercy nodded, understanding the depth of Luke's plan. Percy noticed Hermes flinch and his blue eyes glaze over with grief and pain when Luke mentioned his mother, and she saw the god glare at Apollo. She realized there was a rather painful story there, but now was not the time. They needed to confirm who Luke's patron was. Zeus was adverse to accepting the fact that his father was returning and Athena always followed Zeus lead. Percy needed to clear Ares of being Luke's patron first.\n\nPercy asked, \"Who did you meet when you were on the run with the Helm and the Bolt?\"\n\nLuke's lips curled into a bitter smile. \"Can you believe it took Zeus almost two days to notice his Bolt was missing? I was relying on that, given the articles on Olympus Weekly about Zeus's overly long afterparties, but I really couldn't believe it.\"\n\nPercy replied, \"Once Zeus noticed it missing, he immediately sent out his Olympian children to find the Bolt. Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Athena and Hermes.\"\n\nEnyo interjected, her voice sharp. \"My father should have sent me too.\"\n\nApollo shot her a warning look. \"Enyo, this isn't about you. Focus.\"\n\nLuke continued, \"I was caught by Ares while trying to get a train ticket. I couldn't risk getting on a plane because Zeus would have sensed the Bolt in his domain, the sky. Ares wanted to drag me to Zeus right away, but my patron convinced Ares to use this situation to mastermind the greatest war ever seen. Thankfully for me, Ares fell for it.\"\n\nPercy concluded, \"So Ares was an accessory after the fact and not involved in the initial theft.\"\n\nLuke sneered. \"You're silly for giving Ares that much credit, just because he was once the patron deity of Sparta.\"\n\nThe room fell silent as the weight of Luke's words settled over them.\n\nPercy finally asked the essential question. \"Who is your patron? What is the name?\"\n\nLuke laughed. \"You already know. You were dream spying on us. You heard his epithet and his voice.\"\n\nPercy insisted, \"I need to hear it from you.\"\n\nLuke wondered aloud, \"Is it you who needs to hear it, or is it Athena, her daddy's little lickspittle?\"\n\nPercy did not look at Athena but her expression could not be pleasant. Luke's eyes were trained on the goddess of strategy and whatever she was emoting greatly pleased Luke. Percy wondered if Luke had some grudge against Athena or if it was just his general contempt for the gods.\n\nPercy repeated, \"Who is your patron?\"\n\nLuke's eyes gleamed with malice. \"Kronos. My patron is Kronos.\"\n\nAthena leaned forward insisted, \"That can't be possible.\"\n\nLuke taunted, \"Believe what you want, or more accurately, what your daddy wants. Kronos told me your biggest weaknesses are your inherent need to please and cater to Zeus and your hatred of Poseidon. Play on those weaknesses, and the goddess of wisdom and strategy becomes useless.\"\n\nEnyo confirmed, \"Luke's patron is very correct.\"\n\nAthena tried to retort, but Apollo reminded them,\n\n\"We are questioning an agent of Kronos who is trying to sow discord among. Stop falling for Luke's ploys.\"\n\n \n\nAthena glared at Luke.\n\n\"You are lying! It is impossible for Kronos to be back and to have enough strength to act this much!\"\n\nEnyo sighed.\n\n\"He is returning. The Great Prophecy in 1945 foreshadowed his return. If you lot would stop freaking out at every singe prophecy and actually analyse them carefully you would know!\"\n\nApollo nodded at Enyo.\n\n\"Yes, anyone who has studied the art of prophecy knows that prophecies are just warnings about the future. A trailer or a blurb before the Fates weave their tapestry. No matter how much some people might try to change the outline will not change. The more you flail and scream trying to alter fate to your wishes the nastier the Fates get.\"\n\nHis eyes were shadowed and Percy knew that he was thinking back at her second death. She wondered if in the Fates original design Icarus' death and it's circumstances were so horrific. She had heard a few versions in which Icarus was supposed to fall of the ship at night and drown. Had that been what the Fates intended? Drowning took too long and typically had no witnesses. Apollo's resolve to keep Icarus alive at all costs could have caused them to alter the script. Or it could have been exactly as they originally intended. The Fates and their workings were mysterious after all.\n\nEnyo spoke up, startling Percy from her thoughts.\n\n\"I have been sensing a devastating and immense war in the horizon since 1942. Ares has too, which is why he has gotten this twitchy in the last decades.\"\n\n \n\nSo three years before the Great Prophecy.\n\n\"The more the Great Prophecy gets delayed, the worse it will be.\" Apollo confirmed to Enyo.\n\nThe goddess of war nodded solemnly, her extression grave, but Percy saw the gleeful anticipation in her dark eyes.\n\nUneasy by the war goddess glee, Percy turned to Luke, who was watching them with a very pleased smile.\n\nPercy stepped forward to try and reason with Luke and get more information out of him,\n\n\"Why do you think Kronos, a vicious, cruel tyrant who ate his own children, is trustworthy?\"\n\nLuke's eyes blazed, \"Western Civilization is a disease choking the world. The gods use demigods like pawns. I'm tired of it. I want them gone.\"\n\nPercy felt the urge to roll her eyes. Luke had access to indoor plumping, took daily showers and ate meals of food that he never worked in fields to grow. He had also received all vaccines to protect him from childhood illnesses. And he wanted the Western Civillization which made all these luxuries possible to fall. Still she needed him cooperative.\n\n\"Yes, the gods can be awful, but they are still better than the titans.\"\n\nPercy could feel the glares of the gods on her when she said that. She glanced back at them, mentally screaming that they were interrogating a dangerous suspect.\n\nLuke's voice rose, \"The rule of Kronos was known as the Golden Age.\"\n\nPercy shook her head, \"That's naive. It was propaganda. As Hyacinthus, I read Clio's historical records as dictated by Mnemosyne, who was around for Kronos' reign. It was awful. The titans regularly snacked on humans, and humans lived in caves.\"\n\nLuke insisted, \"The second reign of the titans will be different. Demigods that aid them will be rewarded, and demigods will finally be able to flourish.\"\n\nPercy asked, \"How will there be demigods to flourish if there are no gods? You need gods for demigods to exist in the first place.\"\n\nLuke was lost for words when a magical explosion rocked the chamber. Hecate, Hypnos, Morpheus, and Nemesis appeared. Hypnos managed to put Asclepius to sleep. Enyo, deeply affected, tackled Hypnos. Hecate engaged Apollo, her eyes blazing with black magical fire. Apollo responded with golden fire in his hands, and the two clashed. Morpheus engaged Hermes, attacking with a staff, while Hermes responded with his caduceus.\n\nApollo yelled at Hecate, \"What are you thinking, Hecate?\"\n\nHecate's voice was cold, \"I am tired of being dismissed and shunted aside. I am the goddess of magic, the one who created the Mist in the first place.\"\n\nNemesis went for Athena, wielding a pair of scimitar swords. Athena defended herself with her spear and shield. Neither of them spoke at first, locked in combat. But Athena broke.\n\n\"Do you think you can get away with this?\" Athena snarled with a vicious spear thrust.\n\nNemesis sneered at Athena.\n\n\"Afraid that a certain misdeed of yours in which that winged monster of Aphrodite assisted you with will come to light? I know it. A sweet little flower suspected you and told me. Your son had fully paid for his sin! There was no need for further punishment!\"\n\nWhat was Nemesis talking about? Percy had no idea. She understood the allusion to Eros and a flower nymph? She had no idea when and where Athena had anything to do with a flower nymph. Which son of Athena was she talking about?\n\n\"Thanks to your father you have never been held accountable for anything, constantly erring toward my domain. That certainty, that entitlement you wear on your head like a crown? It won't last. Eventually, there will be a reckoning. I will not miss out on this chance!\"\n\nLuke slipped through the chains. It was unclear if it was his powers as a son of Hermes, or if it was the doing of one of the gods. Percy pulled out Riptide and started fighting him.To her utter outrage, Luke had the gall to grab Hyacinthus' sword from the belt of the slumbering Asclepius, and he and Percy clashed. She attacked him fiercely, driving him away from her slumbering son, both her sons. Will thankfully moved out of the way of any of the fights, pressing himself against a corner wall.\n\nAt first, Percy had the upper hand, but she couldn't injure Luke and the Styx either enhanced fighting skills or Luke had been holding back a lot during spars. They were too evenly matched. Luke scrambled away as Hecate threw him a dagger. Percy sensed poison on it. She thought Luke planned to use it on her, but he threw the dagger at Will instead. Percy saw Will's eyes widen, and her precious boy froze. Percy could not allow him to get hurt. Not again. Never again.\n\nPercy instinctively stepped in the path of the dagger to protect Will. It hit her in her upper abdomen, and the poison acted fast. Apollo screamed when he saw her injury. His voice raw and piercing. Hecate and the rest used the distraction to grab Luke and teleport away.\n\nApollo rushed to Percy's side, his voice trembling, \"Percy, stay with me. Please.\"\n\nPercy gasped, \"Will... protect Will.\"\n\nWill knelt beside his mother, tears streaming down his face, \"Mom, don't leave us.\"\n\nAsclepius, now awake, hurried to his mother's side, \"We need to get her to the healing chambers, now!\"\n\nApollo nodded, lifting Percy gently, \"Hold on, my love. We'll save you.\"\n\nIn the healing chambers, Apollo laid Percy on a bed, his hands glowing with divine energy as he tried to heal her. But the poison was too potent.\n\n\"It's Elder Python Venom,\" Apollo said, his voice breaking. \"I can't heal it.\"\n\nWill cried, \"No, there has to be a way!\"\n\nApollo's tears fell onto Percy's face, \"You will fail to save what matters most, in the end,\" he whispered, recalling the prophecy.\n\nPercy, despite the pain, refused to give up. She reached deep inside herself, finding a glass sphere at her core. With a final effort, she cracked it. The poison and the poisoned blood flowed out of her wound, leaving her weak but alive.\n\nApollo's eyes widened in amazement, \"Percy, you did it.\"\n\nPercy smiled weakly, \"I couldn't leave you all behind.\"\n\nWill hugged his mother tightly, \"Thank you, Mom.\"\n\nAsclepius placed a hand on Percy's shoulder, \"You're a true hero, Mom.\"\n\nApollo kissed Percy's forehead, \"Rest now, my love. We'll take care of everything.\"\n\nThe gods outside the chamber breathed a collective sigh of relief, knowing that another Dark Age had been avoided for now.\n\nAs sleep was claiming her, Percy heard Athena complain,\n\n\"Apollo wasted time on a mortal instead of chasing down the rebel gods. The rebel gods had this planned. Castellan demanded Jackson and Solace to buy more time for Hecate, Morpheus, Hypnos, and Nemesis to act. The target for the dagger was never Solace; it was Jackson. Luke knew that if he threw it at Jackson, she would easily dodge, but if he threw it at Solace, she would shield him with her own body.\"\n\nAthena derided, \"Silly maternal instinct.\"\n\nPercy realized why Athena's kids were so messed up. Enyo congratulated Athena,\n\n\"Well done, Athena, for only figuring out the enemy's plans well after the damage is done.\"\n\nPercy saw Apollo about to rise, intent on yelling at Athena but she grabbed hold of his hand to keep him near her. This situation did not need anymore complications. Let Athena keep her pride and posturing for know. The coming war would humble her enough. Nemesis definitely seemed bent on ensuring that.\n\nIn my original outline, the plan was for Percy's mortality to crack when she was fighting Ares on the beach but it did not fit the overall flow of the story so I changed it.\n\nThe year 1942 is important because a certain daughter of Pluto died then.\n\nCredit to IWantColouredRain for the idea of Luke aiming at Will to get to Percy. Check out her awesome stories insipired by this one. Links right above.\n\nZeus decides to make the ostrich his new sacred animal.\n\nHermes confesses a huge secret.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nThe grand hall of Olympus was filled with tension. The gods had gathered to discuss the recent revelations regarding Luke Castellan, who had stolen Zeus' bolt and Hades' Helm. The air crackled with divine energy as the gods took their places, their expressions ranging from anger to concern.\n\nApollo, Hermes, Athena, and Enyo stood before Zeus, ready to report on the events that had transpired during Luke's escape. Apollo's golden aura shimmered with frustration, while Hermes' wings twitched with impatience. Enyo's eyes burned with a fierce intensity, and Athena's gaze was sharp and calculating.\n\nZeus sat on his throne, his eyes blazing with anger.\n\n\"Explain to me how Luke Castellan managed to escape confinement on Olympus itself,\" he demanded, his voice echoing through the hall.\n\nApollo stepped forward, his voice steady but filled with emotion.\n\n\"Father, Luke confessed that Kronos is rising. He has bathed in the Styx, making him physically invulnerable, and his mind is shielded by strong magic. The minor gods Hecate, Morpheus, Hypnos, and Nemesis helped him escape.\"\n\nZeus' eyes narrowed.\n\n\"The boy must be lying. The magical protections on him likely confused your truth sense and Hermes' lie detection.\"\n\nHermes bristled at the accusation.\n\n\"Father, we are not easily deceived. Luke's words rang true.\"\n\nAthena shook her head in disagreement.\n\"This talk of Kronos rising might just be a smokescreen to cover the machinations of Hecate and her fellow rebels. They want us to go chasing a destroyed titan king and miss their movements.\"\n\nEnyo's lips curled into a sneer.\n\n\"The Castellan boy was right about you, Athena. Always so eager to please daddy that you can't see past your own large nose. All that is missing is for you to accuse Uncle Poseidon of some nonsense!\"\n\nPoseidon, who had been silent until now, spoke up, his voice filled with anger.\n\n\"Why was my daughter Percy forced to be present during Luke's interrogation? You insisted on it, Zeus, and she was gravely injured and almost died!\"\n\nZeus raised a hand to defend himself, glaring at his brother in annoyance.\n\n\"Luke refused to talk unless Percy Jackson and her son Will Solace were present. It was the only way to get him to speak. It was a necessary risk. Besides she did survive.\"\n\nPoseidon glared at his brother but Artemis caught her uncle's eye and shook her head. Better to let it go for now. Zeus was definitely dispeased that Percy was alive when his own daughter Thalia Grace was not.\n\nEnyo's eyes flashed with anger.\n\n\"It was a trap. Luke stalled until Hecate and the other rebel gods were ready. They used Percy and Will as distractions to cover their escape. We could hardly go all out with someone with as many ties to the council as Percy Jackson and her son present. I for one don't want another civilization collapse.\"\n\nAthena's eyes narrowed. \"You are stealing my deduction, Enyo.\"\n\nThe two goddesses of war began to argue, their voices rising in anger. Zeus quickly intervened, his voice booming.\n\n\"Enough! Enyo, leave us.\"\n\nEnyo glared at Athena before turning to leave, her eyes briefly meeting those of her mother Hera and her brother Ares, who had been freed from his chains at Hera's insistence. Ares however did not dare speak and found himself glared by almost every other Olympian save for Hephaestus who was smirking at Ares and his recent blunders. Ares seethed but kept his mouth closed after warning glares from both his parents.\n\nAs Enyo stormed out of the hall, the remaining gods turned their attention back to the matter at hand. Apollo's voice was filled with determination.\n\n\"We must find a way to to recapture Luke Castellan and break the protections on his mind so we can have true and full confimation. If Kronos is truly rising, we cannot afford to be divided.\"\n\nHermes nodded in agreement.\n\n\"We need to work together, now more than ever.\"\n\nAthena's eyes softened as she looked at her fellow gods.\n\n\"We must put aside our differences and focus on the greater threat. This rebellion would spell disaster for us all, especially given that prophecy. We need to investigate if Hecate and the other three have more supporters.\"\n\nApollo, Artemis and Poseidon glared at Athena for mentioning the prophecy and the possibility that it could be about Percy.\n\nArtemis decided to interject.\n\n\"I understand that no one wants to accept the possibility of Kronos returning, but we must investigate just in case.\"\n\nZeus' expression softened slightly as he looked at his daughters.\n\n\"Very well. We will work together to uncover the truth and stop the rebels. But be warned, any further betrayal will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThat last one was aimed at all his sons, Ares in particular.\n\nThe gods nodded in agreement, their resolve strengthened by the gravity of the situation. As they left the hall, they knew that the road ahead would be difficult, but they were determined to face it together.\n\nWhen the gods dispersed, Apollo and Hermes discreetly followed Ares and Aphrodite. Artemis went to check that Percy was all right. As Apollo and Hermes eavesdropped, they heard Aphrodite's voice rising in anger.\n\n\"How dare you think that the abandoned and derelict WATERLAND was a place suitable for a romantic date with me?\" Aphrodite's voice was filled with fury. \"I bragged about the 'special date' you were preparing, and now all of Olympus is laughing at me!\"\n\nAres defended himself, his voice strained. \"Kronos was affecting my mind, Aphrodite. I can't be blamed for what I did under his influence.\"\n\nAphrodite scoffed. \"I've noticed the lowering quality of our dates recently. What's your excuse for that?\"\n\nAres sighed.\n\n\"Hephaestus keeps a keen eye on romantic places. I have to work around it.\"\n\nAphrodite's eyes narrowed.\n\"Try harder, or there will be Tartarus to pay. And another thing, I'm very angry that you tried to get Percy, the third incarnation of Hyacinthus, killed. I've been looking forward to observing the third run of Apollo's and Hyacinthus' romance. I will not be pleased if Percy dies before the romance even starts. Considering the recent revelations about Icarus, Percy and Apollo might just become my favorites.\"\n\nAres looked taken aback. \"I didn't realize...\"\n\nAphrodite cut him off. \"You'd better start realizing, Ares. Or you'll have more than just Hephaestus to worry about.\"\n\nApollo and Hermes exchanged glances, their expressions grim. They knew that the situation was more complicated than they had initially thought. As they continued to listen, they realized that the battle against Kronos would require not only their strength but also their unity.\n\nBack at Apollo's healing chambers, Percy, Will and Asclepius were joined by Artemis. The goddess of the hunt placed a comforting hand on Percy's shoulder.\n\n\"Are you all right, Percy?\"\n\nPercy nodded, her eyes filled with determination.\n\n\"I'll be fine, Artemis. The poison is out and Apollo and our son healed the injury. I barely even have a scar. They just want to monitor me because of the bloodloss and for any side effects to the poison. No one has survived Elder Python Venom before apparently.\"\n\nArtemis smiled softly.\n\n\"We'll get through this together, Percy. You have the strength of your past lives and the support of your friends and family. We won't let Kronos win. I will make that boy pay for this.\"\n\n \n\nAs Apollo and Hermes entered the room, Clio and Lee Fletcher also arrived. Clio and Artemis exchanged strange glances as they both positioned themselves near Percy.\n\nPercy looked up at Apollo, her eyes filled with worry.\n\n\"When am I leaving? Zeus can't possibly be happy that three mortals, Will, Lee, and I, have stayed in Olympus for this long.\"\n\nAsclepius snorted, \"The only reason Zeus doesn't bring his mortal hookups to Olympus is because Hera would make a scene.\"\n\nApollo warned Asclepius, \"Avoid talking ill of Zeus right now. The king of the gods is angry enough as it is.\"\n\nClio spoke up, \"Before Hades left, he informed me that he will be returning Sally Jackson to her apartment soon.\"\n\nPercy's worry deepened, \"What about Smelly Gabe? He might harm my mother. He claimed money from the life insurance when Sally was assumed dead. He won't be happy when he has to return the money.\"\n\nApollo placed a reassuring hand on Percy's shoulder, \"Don't worry, Percy. I've already dealt with Gabriel Ugliano.\"\n\nPercy was almost tempted to ask how, but she caught Will's eyes and decided it was not for the ears of an 8-year-old. Likely there was a very ugly and stinky skin hanging somewhere. Percy could swear that Apollo had barely left her side, but she knew that gods could be in multiple places at once. She was snapped out of her musings by Hermes' voice arguing on behalf of Luke.\n\nHermes, trying to convince the others, kept saying, \"My son Luke might be influenced by Kronos, just like Ares was.\"\n\nApollo shook his head, his golden eyes blazing with barely veiled anger.\n\n\"That's not how it works, Hermes and you know it! Luke is a mortal and would have decided out of free will to help Kronos. Ares wasn't directly controlled either, just given strong suggestions that acted on his impulses. Luke is serving Kronos out of his own free will, and you need to accept that.\"\n\nHermes stubornly insisted, \"Luke is not a bad kid. He might be misguided and could be brought back to the right path.\"\n\nPercy spoke up, \"Luke stole Zeus' bolt and Hades' Helm. Zeus will want Luke's head on a spike for this humiliation, and Hades will ensure that Luke's afterlife is very unpleasant. With his actions, Luke has doomed himself.\"\n\nHermes argued, \"It's not fair.\"\n\nPercy laughed at Hermes saying that it was unfair that it was unfair that his disgrace of a son would pay for his crimes.\n\n\"Unfair? Unfair?\"\n\nPercy reminded him, \"I almost died and I am in bedrest because Luke threw a poisoned dagger at Will, an 8-year-old, hoping I would intercept the knife and get lethally injured instead. It's sheer luck that I managed to survive.\"\n\nHermes had no reply to that. The messenger god looked at Will, whose eyes were still red and swollen from all the crying and lack of sleep over the trauma he had endured recently due to Luke Castellan and then at Percy, pale and exhausted, constantly sipping elixirs that Asclepius handed her regularly like clockwork.\n\nPercy, curious, asked, \"Why do you care so much about Luke?\"\n\nHermes startled at her question and replied with some incredulity,\n\n\"Luke is my son.\"\n\nPercy countered,\n\n\"Chris Rodrigues is your son as much as Luke is, but Chris hasn't even been claimed by you. Why is Luke so special to you when your other kids aren't?\"\n\nFrom her memories of Icarus' life, Percy recalled that Hermes never visited his son Cydon, the founder of a city that still stood. She had a feeling that if she asked Hermes about Cydon now, the god would not even remember that sweet little baby who had been a rather lively five year old when Icarus had died. Out of respect for that long dead demigod who had to the best of her knowledge not committed any serious crimes she decided not to ask Hermes about him.\n\nDuring Luke's interrogation, Percy noticed that Hermes grew upset when Luke mentioned his mother. The god flinched, his eyes showing pain and then he glared in anger at Apollo. Had it been anyone else, Percy would have assumed that Apollo had done something to Luke's mother, but Hermes was Apollo's favorite brother. They avoided steping on each other's toes. The only time they had done so was during the Trojan War when they supported different sides. And even then Hermes had helped Priam reach Achilles to get Hector's body back.\n\nPercy wanted to know, \"Who is Luke's mother, and why is she so important to you?\"\n\nApollo demanded, \"Yes, Hermes, tell us.\"\n\nThe sun god had definitely realised that there was a deeper story there.\n\nCornered, Hermes had no choice but to confess. \"Luke's mother, May Castellan, is the reincarnation of Crocus of Sparta, son of Poseidon, best friend of Prince Hyacinthus, and my favorite lover.\"\n\nThe room fell silent as the weight of Hermes' confession settled in. Percy, Apollo, and the others exchanged glances, realizing the depth of the connections and the complexities of their intertwined fates.\n\nPercy, utterly stunned and processing the revelation, asked,\n\n\"So, Luke is the son of May Castellan, the reincarnation of Crocus, your favorite lover? My favorite brother? Crocus is back?\"\n\nHermes nodded, his expression somber. \"Yes, and that's why I care so much about him. I see Crocus in Luke, and I can't bear to lose him.\"\n\nPercy sat up wringing her hands and looked at Hermes.\n\n\"Where is May now? Why didn't Luke stay with her?\"\n\nHermes looked into the distance, guilt and regret flashing in his blue eyes.\n\n\"After giving birth to Luke, May tried to become the Pythia, the Oracle of Delphi, but she failed to house the oracular spirit and went insane.\"\n\nPercy's jaw dropped. What was May thinking? Was she truly that different from Crocus. Was the lack of a Spartan upbringing that caused such a difference between the two incarnations of her best friend and brother?\n\n\"She lives in Westport, Connecticut. I ensure that she doesn't lose her home, her utilities don't get cut, and she has food, but I haven't been able to find a caretaker. Everyone I try to hire gets frightened by May's bursts of oracular power and leaves.\"\n\nHermes blamed Apollo's Oracle for May's insanity. Apollo reminded him with a stern glare.\n\n\"I forbade any more mortal women from attempting to house the Oracle almost thirty years ago because the world didn't need any more mad oracles. I didn't have oversight over May's attempt. I would have forbidden her from trying.\"\n\nHermes told him, \"Chiron allowed May to try.\"\n\nApollo was irritated. He had told Percy that the only reason the Pythias were supposed to be maidens was to avoid pregnancies so the fetus would not be corrupted by the Pythian energies but it still was a longstanding tradition. To have it casually broken must rankle.\n\n\"A woman in a romantic relationship who had given birth a child was allowed to do so? I really need to have a long talk with Chiron.\"\n\nHermes explained, \"May's clear sight was very strong. She already had some prophetic talent and was certain that she would succeed.\"\n\nPercy interjected, \"My mother Sally's clear sight is very strong too, but she would never dream of trying to become the Oracle. Not after having me. Also, I recall Crocus, and he would have never done something as reckless as what May did, not with the responsibility of a child.\"\n\nPercy looked between the two gods and wondered aloud, \"Was May influenced somehow to try and assume the Oracle? It led to Luke awakening Kronos. Kronos's sister Phoebe was the Keeper of Delphi before Apollo was born and the current regime has given her little reason to like Olympus.\"\n\nThe room fell silent as everyone pondered Percy's words. The implications were troubling, and the gods knew they had to tread carefully in the days to come.\n\nI am on a crazy roll today. Enjoy this short chapter.\n\nPercy catches Sally up on things.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\nPercy stood at the threshold of Apollo's healing chambers, fully recovered from the poisoned dagger that Luke Castellan had aimed at her son, Will, Percy was ready to face the world once more. She and Apollo had already said their goodbyes and Zeus was keeping Apollo busy looking for Hecate and the other rebel gods. Apollo was also looking for Luke Castellan and Percy knew that when her beloved got a hold of that young man, he would wish for something like the fate of Marsyas.\n\nLee had already gone to camp several days earlier. Percy was injured while a guest on Olympus after Zeus had put her in danger so the King of the Gods could not raise that much a fuss over her presence on his precious mountain, and Will was too young to be sent away from his sick mother. Lee however, Zeus had pettily demanded to leave. Apollo, not wanting to provoke his father given the state of affairs had taken his son to Camp. Percy had missed Lee in the last three days.\n\nAriadne, the former Princess of Crete and Icarus' best friend, arrived to escort Percy and Will back to Camp Half-Blood. Alongside them was Asclepius, Percy's son and the god of medicine. As minor gods, they were usually beheath Zeus' notice unless he had a reason to be fixated on them. Right now, Zeus had bigger concerns and since Ariadne was Dionysus's wife and Asclepius Apollo's son, their loyalty was not in doubt. The king of the gods was busy monitoring other gods, who werent so closely tied to Olympians.\n\n\"Are you ready, Percy?\" Ariadne asked, her eyes filled with concern and tenderness.\n\nImmediately after Ares' confession had been aired live on every screen on Olympus, Ariadne had read through the lines, genius that she always was and hurried to Aeaea to talk to both her mother, Queen Pasiphae and her aunt Circe. Both Immortal Sorceresses were very old, highly skilled and knowledgeable. Ariadne had hoped that they knew something of Kronos' rise. Unfortunately, neither daughter of Helios had been approached by Kronos' allies.\n\nPrivately, Percy thought that it was foolish of them. Circe and Pasiphae might not be the powerhouses that Hecate was, but they were still powerful, skilled and very, very dangerous. They also had ample reasons to resent at least two Olympians. Poseidon might be Percy's father but she was aware that what he had done to Pasiphae was nothing short of horrible. Circe was still obligated to stay in her island due to a decree by Zeus done thousands of years ago. Percy hoped that Ariadne's godhood was enough to keep both goddesses neutral if not cooperative with Olympus.\n\nPercy nodded at Ariadne, her heart heavy with the weight of recent events.\n\n\"Yes, let's go. But before we return to camp, I need to see my mother.\"\n\nOut of the corner of her eye, she noticed Asclepius made a strange expression but his face smoothed to its sweet youthfulness when she looked at him directly. Percy smiled at her firstborn son. She had given him the Crown of Lelex, which was his birthright but Luke had stolen Hyacinthus' sword, which Asclepius had received from Clio thousands of years ago, shortly before he himself went to Chiron's camp. Asclepius had held on to that sword and kept it in perfect condition only for a thieving, murderous little bastard to steal it from him. Despite what Hermes believed, Luke was nothing like Crocus.\n\nAriadne's chariot, disguised as a sleek car, awaited them outside. As they drove through the bustling streets, Percy couldn't help but reflect on the journey that had led her here. The quest for Zeus' bolt had revealed the true culprits: Luke Castellan, Ares, and the rising threat of Kronos. The gods Hecate, Morpheus, Hypnos, and Nemesis had aided Luke's escape, and Zeus' refusal to accept the possibility of Kronos' return had only complicated matters. She could not understand why Zeus was being so stubborn. Even if they did not have irrefutable proof that Kronos was back it was still obvious that he was. Ares' had been influenced. Hecate, Morpheus, Hypnos and Nemesis had unmasked themselves as rebels to help Luke escape. That told Percy that Luke was important to Kronos. The Titan king and his allies needed Luke Castellan.\n\nApollo had agreed with her. Luke was likely the conduit by which Kronos' essence was rising from Tartarus. The more demigods swore alliance to Kronos, the more anchors he would have to the world and then it would be a matter of time. Time which the king of the gods was wasting playing ostrich. At least both Poseidon and Hades would prepare their kingdoms for war. They were also terrified of the possibility of their father rising but they at least could be counted to prepare properly and accept reality.\n\nArriving at Sally Jackson's apartment, Percy felt a surge of emotion. Hades had kept his word and returned her mother unharmed after receiving his helm. The negotiations between Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus had resulted in concessions, including the revocation of Hades' banishment from Olympus.\n\nSally Jackson opened the door, her eyes widening in surprise and relief. \"Percy! Oh, my dear, you're safe!\"\n\nPercy embraced her mother tightly. \"Mom, I'm so glad to see you.\"\n\nSally's gaze shifted to the others. \"And who are these young men?\"\n\nPercy introduced them with pride. \"This is Will Solace, demigod son of Apollo, and Asclepius, immortal son of Apollo and God of Medicine. And this is Ariadne, a dear friend.\"\n\nSally's eyes widened further. \"Two gods? How?\"\n\nPercy nodded, her heart swelling with emotion. \"Yes, Mom. And I promise, we'll explain everything.\"\n\nAs they settled into the apartment, Sally couldn't help but ask, \"What happened to Gabe?\"\n\nPercy's expression hardened. \"Apollo dealt with him. You won't have to worry about him anymore.\"\n\nSally nodded, accepting the answer. \"Tell me everything, Percy. What happened while I was in stasis?\"\n\nPercy recounted the events of her quest, how she and Will had been sent by Zeus to find his bolt, and how they had uncovered the truth about Luke and Kronos. She explained how Poseidon had manipulated the mist to portray her as the victim and how the police were now hunting for Gabe. The police were under the impression that Gabe Ugliano hired criminals to kill his wife for the life insurance money and his stepdaughter for the money from her modelling career. Percy was in the clear. She had seen how social medial had blown up in her defense.\n\nSally sighed with relief but also with a hint of sadness. \"I never wanted this life for you, Percy. I married Gabe to protect you from the monsters that were drawn to your scent. His stench kept them away.\"\n\nAsclepius interjected gently, \"You could have sent Percy to camp, Mrs. Jackson.\"\n\nSally shook her head. \"I couldn't bear to lose her. She is my daughter, my only child.\"\n\nPercy reached out and took her mother's hand. \"I understand, Mom. But now, I have to stay at camp. I can't be separated from my children, just like you couldn't be separated from me.\"\n\nSally's teacup slipped from her hand, shattering on the floor. \"Children... How can you have children?\"\n\nPercy took a deep breath and began to explain. \"Mom, there's so much you need to know. I am the reincarnation of Prince Hyacinthus and Icarus of Crete. After Hyacinthus died, Apollo created Asclepius from the essence of the original hyacinth flower. When Icarus died, Apollo transformed my corpse into a tree and convinced Persephone to create a magical connection between the tree and my soul in the underworld. When I was born as Percy, the tree pulled my essence to alert Apollo that Hyacinthus had been reincarnated again. While trying to get a vision of my whereabouts, Apollo accidentally mixed his godly essence with mine and created Will.\"\n\nSally's eyes filled with astonishment and tears. \"So, I'm a grandmother?\"\n\nPercy smiled softly. \"It's a long story, but the important thing is that we're together now.\"\n\nSally hugged both Will and Asclepius, her changing blue eyes overflowing with love.\n\n\"Welcome to the family, boys.\"\n\nAs they continued to talk, the understanding between mother and daughter grew stronger. Sally accepted Will and Asclepius as her grandchildren, and the family found solace in each other's presence.\n\nThe journey ahead was uncertain, with the threat of Kronos looming and the gods divided. But with the support of her family and friends, Percy Jackson was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\nAs they prepared to leave for Camp Half-Blood, Ariadne's chariot awaited them once more. Percy turned to her mother, her heart filled with determination.\n\n\"Mom, we'll be back. And we'll make sure the world is safe for all of us.\"\n\nSally wiped her tears and smiled. \"I understand. Maybe I'll move to Montauk so I can be closer to you and Will.\"\n\nAriadne and Asclepius both nodded in approval. \"That's a great idea,\" Ariadne said. \"We don't want Percy making long trips outside of camp.\"\n\nAs they prepared to leave, Sally hugged Percy tightly. \"Stay safe, my dear. And remember, you always have a home here.\"\n\nPercy smiled, her heart filled with gratitude. \"I will, Mom. Thank you for everything. I will be in touch with you as often as I can.\"\n\nSally nodded, her eyes filled with pride. \"I know you will, Percy. I believe in you.\"\n\nWith that, Percy, Will, Asclepius, and Ariadne set off on their journey, ready to face the trials and tribulations that awaited them. As much as Percy would like to believe that it would be smooth sailing from now on, she was all too aware of how much the Fates liked to torment her.\n\nAt the edge of camp Asclepius had to say goodbye to his mother and little brother.\n\n\"I have to go back to Olympus to help manage the virus that father caused when you fell of the Arch. It will be a long pandemic, and it will take years for the world to go back to normal.\"\n\nPercy looked at her son with concern. \"What will happen to schooling, work, and everyday life?\"\n\nAsclepius sighed. \"Only time will reveal, but it won't be easy.\"\n\nThey closed their eyes so Asclepius could flash away to Olympus, Ariadne telling them when it was safe to open their eyes again. Ariadne would be coming with them in camp. In exchange for getting the agreement of neutrality from Circe and Pasiphae, Ariadne had managed to finagle more visits to her husband from Zeus. Once again Percy had to shake her head at how petty the king of the gods could be. Not only he had punished his son with a century of forced sobriety but he was also punishing the innocent Ariadne by forcibly separating her from her husband.\n\nPercy Jackson, the reincarnation of Prince Hyacinthus and Icarus, walked through the gates of Camp Half-Blood with her son, Will, by her side. The twelve-year-old demigod had just recovered from Luke's murder attempt on Olympus, and now she was returning to the place she called home. Beside her, the goddess Ariadne, Icarus' best friend, accompanied them to visit her husband, Dionysus, the camp director.\n\nAs they made their way through the camp, Percy couldn't help but notice the stares and whispers that followed them. The camp was in shock after learning that Luke had stolen the bolt to start a war between the gods and had almost killed Will, an eight-year-old child trying to reach his mother.\n\n\"Mom, why is everyone staring at us?\" Will asked, his voice filled with curiosity and a hint of fear.\n\nPercy squeezed his hand reassuringly. \"They're just surprised, Will. A lot has happened, and they're trying to process it all.\"\n\nAriadne, walking on Percy's other side, nodded in agreement. \"It's not every day that such events unfold. Give them time.\"\n\nAs they approached the Hermes Cabin, Travis and Conner Stoll, the new head counselors, stepped forward. They looked nervous but determined.\n\n\"Percy,\" Travis began, \"we wanted to apologize on behalf of our cabin. We had no idea what Luke was planning, and we don't support his actions.\"\n\nConner nodded vigorously. \"We promise, we don't want any part of his goals.\"\n\nPercy smiled warmly at them. \"I only hold Luke responsible. As long as the rest of the Hermes Cabin doesn't support him, I have no grudge against you.\"\n\nThe brothers visibly relaxed, relief washing over their faces. \"Thank you, Percy,\" Travis said. \"That means a lot to us.\"\n\nAs they continued towards the dining pavilion, Percy noticed that there were fewer people at the Hermes table. Most of the unclaimed demigods, including Chris Rodrigues, were absent.\n\n\"Are they delayed for lunch?\" Percy asked, her brow furrowing in concern.\n\nTravis winced. \"Shortly after the Dioscuri arrived to arrest Luke, a lot of demigods quietly slipped away from camp when Mr. D was called away.\"\n\nPercy's heart sank at the news. \"The more demigods swearing themselves to Kronos, the easier it will be for the Titan King's essence to rise from Tartarus,\" she murmured.\n\nAriadne placed a comforting hand on Percy's shoulder. \"We'll find a way to stop them, Percy. My father in law might insist on being blind to the situation, but the rest of the Olympians are on alert.\"\n\nExcept Athena, Percy thought. The goddess of wisdom was determined to follow her father's lead as according to Artemis. But the rest of the gods would be ready to act if needed. Or get a demigod to act for them. Time would tell.\n\nAs they reached the dining pavilion, the whispers grew louder. Percy could hear snippets of conversations, all centered around the recent events.\n\n\"Did you hear? Luke almost killed Will!\"\n\n\"I can't believe he stole the bolt to start a war.\"\n\n\"Poor Percy, she's been through so much.\"\n\nPercy took a deep breath and held her head high. She knew she had to be strong for Will and for the camp. As they sat down at the table, Dionysus approached them, his usual grumpy demeanor softened by concern.\n\n\"Welcome back, Percy,\" he said, his voice uncharacteristically gentle. Percy blinked and pinched herself, incredulous that Dionysus was being so pleasant.\n\n\"I'm glad to see you and William are safe.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. D,\" Percy replied. \"It's good to be back.\"\n\nDionysus turned to Ariadne, a rare smile tugging at his lips. \"And you, my dear, it's always a pleasure to see you.\"\n\nPercy suppressed a snort, understanding why Dionysus was being so nice to her. It was all for Ariadne's benefit. Well, at least it meant that the god of wine truly loved and appreciated her friend. After what Theseus had done, it never hurt to be careful.\n\nAriadne smiled warmly at her husband. \"It's good to see you too, Dionysus.\"\n\nAs they ate, Percy couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The camp was on edge, and the threat of Kronos loomed over them all. But she knew they had to stay strong and united if they were to face the challenges ahead.\n\nPercy and Will sat down at Poseidon's table and prepared the customary offerings for the gods. Percy was relieved to see the campers follow the formula she had shown to them not long ago. An offering for each Olympian, even if she noticed the Apollo table make the meat pieces for Zeus and Ares practically pea sized. She prepared her own offerings, the customary twelve, Hestia, Hades, Zagreus, Asclepius, Clio, Ariadne and each one of the muses. Will followed her lead and he stuck very close to her, as it had become his habit since Luke threw the dagger. Percy looked at Will's red eyes with concern. She would have to make sure he got enough sleep from now on. Will was a growing child, he needed to get a full night's sleep, it was not negotiable.\n\nAs she was pondering what to do about Will's recent trauma she almost bumped into Clarisse and Ellis. Clarisse's face was carefully blank and Ellis looked rather guilty.\n\n\"Is this about your dad?\" She asked them as they walked to the hearth together.\n\nClarisse' lips pursed but she refused to give anything away. Percy looked at Ellis.\n\n\"We are sorry that our dad framed you.\" Ellis told her.\n\nPercy grimaced.\n\n\"Your dad was tricked by Luke and his patron. And even if he wasn't I am not in the habit of condemning the kids for the parent's actions.\"\n\nClarisse's face twitched and she finally grit out with great reluctance.\n\n\"Great fight. Beckendorff managed to get some footage of it. Can't believe you beat our dad.\"\n\nPercy gave Clarisse an incredulous stare.\n\n\"I didn't actually beat him? He attacked without me challenging him formally first. Immortals need to be challenged first in order to fight a mortal at their full ability. He didn't and that nerfed him a lot. Don't take that fight as a sample of his actual fighting ability. Had I done the mistake of actually challenging him it would have been a disaster for me. I wouldn't have lasted five seconds. And even with him nerfed and handicapped it still would have gone badly for me if the twins and my dad had not shown up when they did.\"\n\nClarise looked stunned for a moment before she smiled and looked haughty around at the eavesdropping demigods.\n\n\"Well, of course. My dad is the god of war. There had to be a reason he lost to a kid.\"\n\nPercy rolled her eyes and started burning her offerings. She heard someone mutter that Percy still got first blood on the god of war but Clarisse quickly descended on however that was. Not wanting to get in an argument Percy quickly ushered Will back to the Poseidon table.\n\nSo this is the end of TLT, Percy's first adventure. Since the document I am writing FTBL is getting ungainly I will continue SOM on a separate story titled When Warm Spring Drives the Winter Out. It might just be SOM or it might be the rest of Percy's books, depends on how long it gets. I will try to publish the first chapter sometime this week, inspiration allowing.\n\nBonus points if you find where I got the new title from.\n\nCheck for the sequel When the Warm Spring Drives The Winter out\n\nThe first chapter of the sequel is out.

{"work_id": 56676244, "full_story": "My back is pointed towards the tall tree as I effortlessly play my golden lyre. I suddenly stop when I see a lean boy almost float towards me, his assortment of tight and loose curls bouncing with each step. He sits down, one leg over the other and tilts his head with curiosity.\n\"Go on!\" He encourages me.\nI stare at him blankly\n\"Please? You are exceptionally good\" He gives a big grin, which intrigues me.\nI let out a warm smile and wave him closer. He sits beside me and I take his hand in mine. I overlap my hands over his, which are uncertain and chipped at the nails. His hands have calluses and scruff spotted on them, which made me thirst for more knowledge about this boy. I start to play a simple song as I guide his hands through each note. His hands are the slightest bit shaky, but I continue through.\n\"It's like a map. The strings are the locations while your hands are yourself. Just think of the notes as directions, and you follow them to get a pleasant sound. That is all it is.\" I say, in hopes that would calm his nerves.\n\"I'm not much of a musician.\" He admits as his hands find a way to his knees which are now to his chest.\n\"Nonsense,\" I counter. \"Everyone is a musician, some just do not know how to express the melody they create.\"\nHe giggles at my words and introduces himself.\n\"I'm Hyacinthus,\" His deep brown eyes flutter when he says this, my heart does the same.\n\"Apollo,\" I say, not sure of his reaction.\n\"That is why you are so very talented at the lyre?\"\nI laugh. \"Yes, I can teach you\"\n\"You can? I apologize, of course you can, but are you sure? That would take a lot of time, I am not a very fast learner\"\n\"I'm a patient teacher\"\n\nHis dark curls took me by storm. How, how could such a boy be that flawless? No, he was more than a boy, no boy was that perfect. He was considerably tall, no taller than I. His complexion reminded me of forest bark that had not been touched by light. His chestnut hair perfectly curved around his soft jaw and curled up from his neck. His personality mirrored that of a bee's, striking yet curious, which evokes me with childlike wonder.He looks at me and his lips draw up, a small smile. A smile that could bring me to my knees without hesitation. I start to snap out of my daydream, then I see his face, Thamyris. His red hair, and pasty white skin. His eyes frost with a green glaze. He stood taller than I. He is a lengthy and grown man, not worthy of Hyacinthus.I can tell his eyes are filled with love for my Hyacinthus. Thamyris is a well-known musician, but more well-known than I? Never. My blood boiled at the thought of him coming close to Hyacinthus. My eyes fill with rage and I walk up to him without thinking.\"Hello, Thamyris.\"\"Apollo, how is my favorite sun olympian?\"\"I am the only sun olympian?\"\"Yes, yes\" He laughs, I grind my teeth.\"Thamyris, I have decided to hold a banquet for you to rejoice in your musical talent,\" I say with false innocence, having no idea what I am thinking.\"A banquet you say? I shall be there.\" He laughs.\"Great.\"\"Will... Will he be there?\" He asks, referring to Hyacinthus.I pause. \"Yes.\"\"Good. I will see you later tonight then?\"\"Yes, I suppose you will.\"I acknowledge him and walk off. Thamyris, the man not worth the boy.I walk to see Hyacinthus. Perfect timing I say under my breath.\"Hm?\" He smiles and giggles, his hair swaying in the wind.\"Sunflower, how are you?\"\"Doing well, nothing new. Any news for you?\"\"Yes actually,\" I take a deep breath. \"Hyacinthus... How would you like to accompany me to a banquet I'm hosting? Just a small one, will not last through the night.\" I grab the cloth of my tunic, straightening it out.He smiles once more. \"I would love to. Who will be there?\"I take a breath of relief. \"Anyone can come. I know Thamyris will be there, I am holding it for him.\"His smile fades.\"You are holding it for... Thamyris?\"\"Yes, Hyacinthus, is that a problem?\"\"No! No. It's just that- Well you know how I feel about him.\"He is right. I do know. The way the fiery man lured Hyacinthus to his bed, and undressed him without his consent. A disgusting man, but not uncommon in Sparta.I grab Hyacinthus's cold, limp hand, and kiss his knuckle. I hold his hand to my chest, my tunic creasing around his soft hand.\"Trust me on this, I will not let him near you. I am throwing him a banquet for reasons I can not say just yet, but I promise, I do not like that man any more than you.\"\"Alright, 'Pello.\" His eyes are stricken with worry, but I need him for this.\"Thank you, Sunflower. You will not regret it.\"He walks off, and I feel guilty. Why am I feeling guilty? I vowed to protect him. I will make sure Thamyris never even glances in his direction again. It is the stars that swear to be there every night, they never break that promise and make even the darkest of nights bright, so, I will not break mine either. Hyacinthus will never feel unsafe again.Nothing more was to be said, so I walk away, a cloud of remorse forming above my head.\n\nThe banquet is gracefully decorated with candles, vines, and food from places I can not pronounce. I want this to be remembered throughout history, even if it is a ruse.I grasp Hyacinthus's hand, now warm and shaky. He looks at me, tilting his head up just the slightest to make direct eye contact.\"You okay?\" He gives a sympathetic smile.\"Of course, what about you?\" I kiss his soft lips, I can feel him smile as he kisses me back.\"I think nervous is the right word.\" He pulls away.\"I will not let him come near you, I promise, just stick with me.\" I squeeze his hand. He nods and I smile. I feel bad, but I will make it up to him. We will hang out, just me and him, no one else.Soon, Thamyris arrived.He entered the room with the confidence of an Ox, he might as well be as clumsy as one. He touches all the decorations that took hours to put up, and I bite my lip with annoyance.He keeps looking behind his neck, searching for Hyacinthus. Hyacinthus is with me, so I do not greet him like you usually would.The guests start to roll in and I smile. My Muses are set up in the back, playing the most amazing music, I really outdid myself.Everyone takes to the floor and starts to dance in diverse ways, I grab Hyacinthus's hands and I drag him over.He laughs and smiles as I hold his hands and move them up and down in a playful motion. He is not a very good dancer, so he relies on me for most moves. He holds me tight and I smile.But soon I cannot stall much longer, and I have to make an announcement about Thamyris because he is the whole reason I'm holding this banquet.I let go of Hyacinthus's hand and walk up to the front of the room, no one's attention directed towards me, yet.\"Excuse me, I would like to raise a toast to Thamyris, the reason we are all here tonight!\" I shout to grab everyone's attention.Thamyris waves his hand and smiles. I force a smile back as he walks up towards me.\"Well, I am not surprised. I am the best musician here,\" The crowd laughs. \"I just thank you all for recognizing that, and celebrating it with me! In preparation, I wrote a song tonight, just for you!\"He walks back to my table and grabs my lyre as he pats my Hyacinthus on the shoulder, I cringe with resentment, but I do not say anything as he walks back to his place next to me.He grabs the instrument, and starts to play. His fingers dance across the golden strings like a leaf in the wind, while the sound plays a beautiful soft and confident tone, perfectly mixing the 2 opposites together, and for a second I forget why I am here. The music starts to become sick and streaky as I remember what I need to do.I started to alter the tone of my lyre so it sounds untuned without touching it.I watch in delight as Thamyris's eyes grow wider and more impatient by the second. He frantically inspects lyre while snapping his neck back to the crowd.\"Thamyris, I thought you were good?\" I taunt as his skin grows as red as his hair.\"I- I am. I swear to Zeus, I am good! Better than the Muses themselves!\"\"Is that so?\" I laugh, and call over one of my Muses. As she comes, her white and golden dress flows behind her, her dark hair following.\"Yes, Apollo?\" Erato asks with a sing-song voice.\"Our guest, Thamyris here, says he is even better than you Muses?\"Erato tilts her head. \"Even better than I, Lord Apollo?\"\"Even better than you\"\"Well then. I challenge you to a music contest! Whoever wins will be declared the best in all of Sparta!\"And whoever loses?\" He asks.\"Will face a punishment designed by the other\"\"Very well\"It was settled, the competition would begin shortly. The crowd is still as water, and one word could create a tidal wave.Erato summons her Lyre and starts to play. Such a beautiful tale that I can visualize it. A million different interpretations can be imagined from her song. A hero's life cut short, a rival romance, or a happy ever after, something so rare, even I am impressed. I look over to see Thamyris. He purses his lips and runs his fingers through his curly hair.Erato finally stops, the crowd is in awe, no words are spoken, the water is still unbothered. She looks at Thamyris and gives a half sympathetic smile.\"Well, that was nothing- I could do better!\" Thamyris sneers while tripping over his own words.She nods, as if giving him the right of way to go and try to be better than herself.He hesitates for a moment, but then grabs my lyre, I cut him off. \"Ah, see that is mine, meaning, you cannot use it. Good luck though!\" Erato glances at me and silently her face reads 'Really? Just let him use your lyre. But I do not.He spits at her feet, and for a second I am about to maim him right here, but Erato cuts me off.\"Borrow mine. I will not mess with it or anything, you probably forgot yours, just borrow mine.\" She speaks softly, turning him away from the crowd so he is not embarrassed.I stare in awe. She is too nice. \"Erato-\"\"Apollo, you can not make it impossible on him.\"She is right, I nod, my golden hair sweeping in front of my face. I tuck it into my ponytail to see Erato handing her lyre to Thamyris.Thamyris scoffs, and snatched her lyre. I turn to her and I whisper \"I'll make you a new one\", because Thamyris would somehow find a way to ruin hers.She nudges me in the side, and lets him play.He uncomfortably grasps the instrument, as it was not fitted and carved for his unnaturally long fingers. Eventually he situates himself and starts to strum it. He manages to play a beautiful tune. I hate to say it, but I start to become engaged with it. I listen closely as a bead of sweat trickles down Thamyris's freakishly long face. His pupils are shaking in the white of his eyes, and I give a sickly grin.The audience listens intensely, their full attention on Thamyris. I just sit back and watch. A little trick I learned from Dionysus: People crack under pressure. Dionysus has often said that people will mess up on various things when they feel pressure to be perfect. That is what I'm counting on.Thamyris slowly gets wrapped up in his own mind and his fears eat away at him. He starts to go off beat while feeling the audience's eyes burn into his hands. His hands eventually slip off of Erato's lyre and he is furious. He throws the instrument to the ground and tears swell up in his eyes.\"That- That is not fair!! It is not my lyre! It's Erato's fault!!\" Thamyris stammers, and Erato seems hurt. Her lyre, a gift from me to her, is shattered into a million silver pieces, and she is devastated.She looked at him, and with despair in her eyes she yells. \"You were challenged to a competition. You lost fairly. You took your anger out on my property. For that you shall suffer. You will never look nor speak on music ever again.\" And with that, she looks at me to finish it offI smile and I blind and mute him.Thamyris grabs his throat and tries to speak, but no sound comes out. His eyes, once frosted with green, are frosted with a gray film. His head turns in every direction in hopes that his sight might be magically regained, but it does not.The first still water, is now a tidal wave of commotion.\n\nOnce the banquet ended, I walk up to Hyacinthus.\"So, what did you think of it?\" I ask, pretty happy with myself.\"How could you do that, Apollo?!\" He snaps at me. \"How could you hurt him like that?\" He takes a step back from me, like he is appalled by my actions.\"Hyacinthus, he hurt you. He deserved it!\" I counter.\"Sure, he was not the best person, but you should not have blinded and muted him!! That could ruin someone's life!\"\"He ruined yours, I was just returning the favor.\"\"Apollo! He might have hurt me, but you should not hurt him back!\" Hyacinthus rebukes.\"Sunflower-\"\"Do not call me that.\" He walks away, I reach out to him, and he hits my hand out of his view.\"Leave me alone, I do not want to have anything to do with you, not now, not ever.\" Tears swell up in his eyes, I made him cry.I am speechless. This is nothing more to say, so he walks away.I am left there, alone. I hurt Hyacinthus. I hurt Hyacinthus. I swore I would not, and I did. It is all my fault. I never really took in account that things could be wrong because of me, but I think this is the worst thing I could've done.I punch the nearest tree and scream to anyone listening.The world seems to go on, kids in Sparta are throwing a discus at each other, and I yearn for the days I did not feel the guilt and loathe the touch of the green grass on my feet. I loathe the wind shoving against my back. I loathe the rich colors of the flowers. I loathe the sun beating against my back. I loathe myself for hurting him. I loathe the world, because everything reminds me of him. I loathe.I fall back onto the grass, the soft stems folding under my arms. I pluck one blade. I did not deserve Hyacinthus I think. I pluck another. He was right to leave me. I pick a few more. He deserves someone better. I pick at the green till there is just a bare space where my hands lay.I stand up, a handful of grass between each one of my fingers. I open my fist up, and a strong gust of wind blows each one from my grasp.\"Feels like no matter what I do, something will go wrong\" I cry to the invisible audience, hoping somewhere, somehow, Hyacinthus is watching.The wind blows my hair so it is no longer tied back.Message received, I mumble as I look towards the wind, now quiet, and still. I turn and walk away from any sign of him, I cannot bring myself to think of him, but that is all I can do.I decide that painting will be the best use of my time. Stroke after stroke I paint. When I step back, purple eyes and dark curls are staring back at me.I result in writing a song instead, but the harp just reminds me of how I failed him.Everything is a reminder of him.\n\nThe wind slams my back as I walk away from my sun. I am mad at him, no, not mad, furious. Why would he do such a thing? It's cruel. Thamyris never deserved that. No thing, mortal, or immortal can have that happen and have it justified.\nThe wind whips my hair against my vibrant cheeks once more.\nA gust of wind uproots the flowers from the green grass, which is now stirring around my curls.\nA boy, who could not be much older than me, gives a sympathetic smile, his wings fluttering behind him.\n\"Has something happened? You look wrong.\" He tilts his head with curiosity.\n\"Sorry, who are you?\" I inquire as I step back onto a flower breaking the stem.\n\"I'm Zephyrus, Hyacinthus.\" He grins.\n\"Oh! Well nice to meet you- How do you know my name? Have I met you before?\" I pick up the broken flower, a Wild Geranium, its purple pedals smashed from my foot.\n\"Oh no, but I know you.\" He riddles.\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"I have been watching you. I know all about your fret with Apollo. Oh, such an arrogant man. I hope you are doing alright now.\" He attempts to sympathize.\n\"Apollo is not arrogant, he's a kind god, and I quite like his company.\" I counter, a bit offended.\n\"That's too bad. Are you still speaking to him?\" He asks.\n\"I asked for a break after a situation that happened between us.\"\n\"Yes, him blinding Thamyris. What sort of 'kind god' would blind a mortal?\" He plucks the flower from my grasp.\n\"Uhm, he is not like that. He was just trying to protect me-\"\n\"By making you more upset with the situation you were already put in, which you were uncomfortable to begin with?\" He blows the flower out of his hand, it floats away.\n\"Well, I guess he did, but I just need some time by myself, he will understand!\" I counter.\n\"Oh, but will he? Has an olympian ever 'understood' a mortal?\" Zephryus chuckles.\n\"Yes, countless times!\" I start to get emotional with Zephyrus's apathy.\n\"Who?\"\nI find a blank in my train of thought. \"Well-\" I stop myself.\n\"A break should not hurt anyone, should it?\" He suggests.\nFor a second I leave my guard in hopes that maybe he is right. It wouldn't hurt to stay with Zephryus until I am ready to go back and talk with Apollo.\n\"I guess it could not harm anyone\" I agree, a bit reluctant nonetheless.\nZephyrus takes my hand, \"That's a good boy\" he grins.\nHe slowly moves his hands down to my arm, which travels to my waist. His hands barely feel like anything, a weightless touch.\n\"What are you doing?\" I snap and shove him away, feeling more than violated.\nHe pulls me back, \"Trust me\" his wings start to move back and forth in an angelic motion.\nWe start to lightly float up in the air, he flashes a malicious grin. I pull him closer, nervous that my feet are no longer on solid ground. Wrapping his arms around me we go faster, flying towards the mountainous range east of us.\nWhile we fly he does a few spins in the air which makes me more anxious than I already was. He then does a swan dive in mid air, letting go of me.\nHis once weightless touch feels like one hundred cows were lifted from my body. I quickly scrabble for composure as my skin feels like the strength of the gods is ripping it up, while my hair flips and twirls in every direction.\nAs I feel the vast field of grass, I feel soft hands under my arms, Zephryus.\nHe throws his head back and laughs, keeping a hold of me high in the air.\nI am distraught in such a way that my vision starts to blackout in the corner of my vision, but soon reaches the center of my eye.\nI lose consciousness.\n\nA/N: If any of you lovely readers want to see more Behind-The-Scenes work and what not, please comment letting me know !! On my main socials I post about BOTS more <33\n\n \n\nI wake up in a cave on the side of the mountains. A feathery slab below me, someone's bed. By the loose decorations scattered around the space, I could only guess one person.\n\n\"Hyacinthus! You are alive! I was afraid you would not wake up!\"\n\nZephyrus.\n\n\"Where am I exactly?\" I inquire, my eyes dart around the spacious living arrangement.\n\n\"Where I live! Make yourself comfortable!\"\n\n\"Hey, I really appreciate this, but you almost killed me and you expect me to just stay here?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah. You said you would.\" His tone becomes a lot more serious.\n\n\"That was before I lost consciousness?\"\n\n\"You still made a promise, Prince of Sparta. Hold up to your end of the bargain.\" His tone transitioned from layed back to demanding in a matter of seconds.\n\n\"And if I do not, Zephyrus?\" I start to get defensive.\n\n\"If you do not comply, let's just say your 'break' with Apollo will be longer than short time\"\n\n\"Are you,\" I pause to make sure I processed what he said correctly \"Are you threatening me?\"\n\n\"I would not say threaten, I prefer the term strongly encouraged with a consequence\" Zephyrus corrects, though I doubt it's a correction.\n\nI stare at him in a nonplus manner. \"You said-\" I gather my thoughts. \"You said gods are cruel! You said you were better than the other gods!\" I try to understand why he is doing this.\n\n\"Sweet, Hyacinthus. Gods are not fair\" He assures me.\n\n\"You have proven that\" I scowl and look away, feeling betrayed.\n\nHe turns to me, lifts up my chin ever so slightly, and turns it towards himself. He leans in closer, and touches his lips on mine. To my surprise, I let him. He sits next to me and places his hand behind my neck, my curls knit between his fingers. And I let him.\n\nHe kisses me once more, his lips slowly parting. His hand starts to leave my body, but I lightly touch his hand.\n\n\"No,\" I pause to think if this is what I truly want. \"Continue.\"\n\nHe gives a playful smirk, placing his hands on my waist, kissing along my jaw. I fall back, as he lays on top of me, weightlessly.\n\nAnd I let him.\n\nI start to feel the weight of what I am letting him fall on top of me, but I let him continue. His kisses turn into small nibbles along my neck, as our bodies perfectly hold one another.\n\n\"Zephyrus,\" I manage to say, his lips moving to my cheek as my jaw moves down.\n\n\"Hm?\" I can feel his smirk against my skin.\n\n\"I,\" I stop myself \"Continue\"\n\nHis smirk grows larger and his hand finds its way to the collar of my tunic, and rests on it for a few seconds, silently asking if he could go underneath. I nod, and his hands find their way below the thin layer of cloth protecting my skin from his.\n\nAnd I let him.\n\nHis hands search my skin as he kisses my lips, his tongue entering my mouth.\n\n\"Zephyrus, I.. I do not like you like that. I am sorry, it's Apollo who I love\" I blurt out, as his hands reach the dip of my hips.\n\n\"Oh.\" His words are like a stab to my side.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I just.. It is not you. You are truly wonderful, but I do not want you to think we have,\" I gesture to us \"A relationship like that. My loyalty is to Apollo, and Apollo alone. I apologize\"\n\nZephyrus nods, disappointment painting his face, each brush stroke more tragic than the last.\n\nThe next morning, Zephyrus was especially quiet. Unlike his usual eccentric and loud nature. I try to strike up a conversation, but it ends in nods and simple hand gestures.\"Zephyrus,\" I stop and ask myself if leading on with the conversation would be an intelligent choice \"I want to apologize, I never meant to lead you on and...\" My voice trails off.\"Do not. I am aware of your situation and relationship with Apollo, I did in the past too, not just after you told me. I apologize.\" He avoids eye contact, and paces around his home, his breathing becoming more erratic.\"I truly am sorry, please forgive me\" I plead, turning his shoulder to face towards me, holding him in place.He scoffs, shoving my chest away from him \"No, it is fine. I beg, it is fine\" . I notice his chest rising and falling, and I slowly breathe in and out.\"Follow the pattern of my breaths\" I place my hand on the middle of his chest, applying slight pressure to control his chest and its spontaneous breathing.And he lets me.\"I apologize\" the words are caught in his throat as he gently puts his hand over mine.\"No, do not.\" I offer a smile in which he takes, with a tear falling down his cheek. I remove my hand from his chest and place it on his cheek, wiping his tears. He gives a small chuckle and pulls me into a soft yet firm hug, his hands wrapping around my back and his arms find themselves over my shoulders.\"Hyacinthus,\" He whispers into my ear, and I hug him back. \"I beg, do not go\"My head falls into his shoulder and tears well up in my eyes, tears staining his tunic ever so slightly. \"I have to.\" I whisper back, tightening my grip on him.I feel him shake his head. \"No. No you do not. You can stay with me. There is more than one way, forever.\"I just stand in the silence, not letting go, what we have. No, what we had. Was not, is not love. Infatuation, that is a possibility, but never love. Not now, not ever. I am in love, in love with a bright, radiant, creative, innovative, emotional, thoughtful, helpful, Olympian; and he loves me the same. That is my hope. I hope that he loves me the way I love him. I do not hope Zephyrus loves me, I hope he likes me. I hope we can be friends, but we want separate ideas.Thamyris is a man, around a decade older than I, I was not in love. I was in pain, and he did not take that pain away. He replaced it. He said it would make me better, that being loved by someone is the feeling everyone should strive for. A feeling of being wanted. But I disagree.The feeling of mutual love between two people, man and woman, man and man, woman and woman, or different, that is the best feeling. Knowing that you have someone that can humor you, empathize with you, they know you. And you know them. That is the feeling I feel for Apollo. Thamyris I felt jealousy, Zephyrus I felt understood, not love. I am in love with no man or god. I am in love with my soulmate. He is neither man or god, he is just Apollo. He is mine. I am his.Finally, I am able to find the words for Zephyrus. \"I am sorry that I can not love you the way you love me. I have tried, but love is more than an emotion. Love is a person. Love is that one person in your life that you can never stay upset with for long. Love is someone that will always have your best interest in mind. Love is someone that supports you, but is not afraid to let you down with criticism when needed. Love is what Apollo is to me. I am sorry\" I glance down, and the hug loosens. I can feel the wind swirling around his home, and I take that as my presence is no longer allowed. I give a slight nod, and walk away.\n\nI am getting used to the constant wind pushing, shoving, and hitting all around my body. Zephryus wants to feel more of me, he wants me, but if I did let him have me, he would not be satisfied. I am not really in love, but he is, he would deliver too much, I would give too little.I make my way to the beach, my hair still whipping against the wind and the sand flying into my eyes, but I do not care. I look up at the sun, his golden rays outlining the water, trees, flowers, and grass. Flowers. Even though Apollo is an expert at his craft, and he is not Persephone by any means, he loves flowers. I lower myself into the sand and just sit in it.My finger glides across the grainy sand as I sketch the Sun. Adding rays of sunlight beaming from the circumference of it.I hear soft footsteps behind me, and a shadow starts to loom over my piece of art.\"Sunflower,\" A tenor voice greets me.The sides of my lips draw up. \"How did you find me?\"\"You never lose the things that were never meant to part from you\" His lips form a small laugh in his regular playful demeanor.Apollo bends down, and sits next to me, looking into my eyes.\"Your eyes are a deep blue currently\"\"Is that so?\" I flash my teeth at himHe takes my hand in his, and lays down on the sand facing towards me, I do the same, looking at him.\"Apollo, I truly apologize.\" I start with, avoiding eye contact.He just nods, and I rest my head on his chest, matching my breathing with his.His lips part, but not a sound leaves his body. \"I,\" He pauses, rethinking what he is going to say. \"I apologize as well.\"A smile tugs at my lips. \"I know.\" I kneed my fingers into the sand as the grains passes through the spaces of my hand. \"Apollo?\"His blond hair bounces as he nods, encouraging me to go on. I hesitate. \"What happens,\" I can feel my throat build up tears \"When I die? What will we be?\"He pauses, giving my question great thought. \"A memory\" he offers a sympathetic smile, but I do not take it.\"Will you move on?\" I ask, focusing on his blue eyes that resemble the afternoon sky.\"Will you?\" He counters my question, and I just sit there in thought. Will I move on as just a memory?\n\nA/N: SORRY for not updating, I got into this play at school (YAYAY), and just a lot of stuff going on !!

A broken and twisted face of horror that walked among the people and gods plucking life from those who stood too close. Eyeing me up and down trying to figure out how my scars wrapped around my body like vines with blossoming roses rather than ugly reminders of what I had done. I glared back to the console. Three kings, the youngest and ruler of the sea, frozen in his seat pondering if he should agree with his brother, the middle, king of all and destined to punish me to my death, the eldest yet forgotten, eyeing me with indifference that shielded a pestering love. I was to be judged for the crimes I've committed among the mortals in the yesteryears of my immortal youth. \n\n\n\n\"Kore,\" Zeus's voice boomed through the grand temple. He always had to be so loud, demanding attention from budding insecurities that lay in the pits of his mind.  I shifted my eyes towards him and peeked through the wet and tangled kinks of my hair. I could sense how uneasy he was with the heaviness of my eyes boring holes into his. I said nothing, keeping myself as eerie and untamed as he knew me best. \n\n\n\nHe began to talk. Saying something of the other and gesturing to the room around us. I didn't care, I couldn't, these insufferable gods and goddesses knew nothing of compassion and emptiness as I did. They knew nothing of what it meant to be born with the heart of a mortal that was decomposing from within. I felt an ache ripple through my chest and I moved a hand up to grip my dress. Zeus noticed and paused his speech to look me over before continuing. \n\n\n\n\"Kore, your action upon the mortals has caused more damage to not only Gaia but also to Olympia. You've roamed far enough and left nothing but trails of bodies in your wake. You started small with the crops of the Earth, then to the livestock of all elements, to the bodies of people, you've managed to bring forth the wake of an armageddon.\" Zeus sounded utterly disappointed. Like a father who purposefully forced his child to grow up in a cage. It was an act. Zeus had more to lose with the mortals below us than his authoritative dictatorship disappointment towards my hubris behaviour. His ego, his id, and his self.\n\n\n\n\"You've put us all in danger,\" Zeus said. The lighting that circled his head like a halo came to life and the crack of thunder whipped as he dragged out the word danger. The lighting rippled down to his fingertips as he raised a sharp finger toward me. Another ache shot through like burning ice and I finally fell to my knees in a weakened gasp. The others around me began to murmur. My mother shot to her feet, wings spreading wide, knocking into those next to her as she flew down from her throne and pulled me in close.\n\n\n\n\"Silence!\" Zeus commanded and all sound around vanished. My mother held me tighter as if she was scared. She was never scared. She couldn't be scared. She created me. I closed my eyes and leaned into my mother's warmth, a chilling cold crept down my body and she was the only hope I had of feeling safe.\n\n\n\n\"Zeus!\" Demeter yelled. \"She is dying!

{"work_id": 54516907, "full_story": "\n   \n\n\n\n Prologue \n\n\nLong ago in Greece, in the temple of the goddess Anithea, there lived a priestess who worshipped said goddess daily. The villagers went to the temple only to admire the beautiful Priestess over the goddess, which started to frustrate her. Although the Priestess was beautiful and loyal to the goddess, she was vain, selfish, and unkind. She took advantage of their generosity, thinking she could get away with anything due to her beauty and that she had her purity due to being Anithea's Priestess.\n\nOne day, the sea god Posiwin arrived at the temple, and when his eyes first saw the woman, he fell in love with the vain Priestess. He tried wooing her with gifts and charms, but she rejected him, calling his trinkets trash. When he tried again, it seemed to work, but the vain woman called him a repulsive fish and rejected his offerings. Enraged by her rejection, he chased her through the temple and mated with her while she was praying to her goddess for help.\n\nThe fish then did her in front of the goddess statue, looking down on them. After being satisfied with what he'd done, the sea god fled the temple just as Anithea arrived at her domain to see her Priestess, worn and panicking, with her clothes torn and hair a mess. The Priestess begged the goddess to punish the sea god for defiling the temple. Anithea was enraged that the girl had allowed herself to be taken advantage of in her temple.\n\nThe Priestess, blazing with fury, unleashed a torrent of shouts at the goddess for failing to pursue the sea god for his transgressions. Growing even more incensed by the audacity of the Priestess trying to dictate her actions, the goddess realized that the Priestess showed no remorse for her behavior. In response, the goddess decreed a punishment befitting the Priestess's callousness and transformed her from a once radiant beauty into a monstrous Gorgon, the embodiment of her inner ugliness.\n\nThe metamorphosis was a terrifying sight to behold. It happened so quickly that the Priestess attempted to apologize, but it was too late. Shimmering wings of gold burst forth from her back, her once smooth skin transformed into glistening scales, her flowing locks morphed into a writhing mass of venomous serpents, her delicate hands turned into razor-sharp claws with a metallic sheen, her feet evolved into powerful talons, tusks erupted from her mouth while her teeth elongated into menacing fangs. Her visage twisted into a grotesque, snake-like appearance.\n\nThe Priestess, now transformed into a Gorgon, fled in terror from the temple and sought the help of the nearby villagers. However, when they saw her, they were instantly turned to stone. Misunderstood and feared, the Gorgon was mistaken for an aggressor and was relentlessly pursued by the villagers. As she fled, she delved deeper into the dense woods, where she caught a glimpse of her reflection in a clear pond and recoiled in horror. Confronted by her monstrous form, the Gorgon sought refuge in the desolate remains of a temple dedicated to the very goddess she once revered but now rejected.\n\nAs her sanity slowly deteriorated day by day and night by night, she found herself descending further into the abyss of the monstrous nature that the world and the gods had branded her with. Despite numerous valiant attempts by brave warriors to defeat the beast on behalf of the goddess, just like her own heart, they all met the same fate, turning into statues that adorned the ruins surrounding the temple she called home.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe eerie and petrifying visages of terrified individuals stood frozen in time, encircling the ancient temple. Emerging from the temple's depths, the gorgon Clardusa, cloaked in a veil of shadow, ventured to survey the faces of the unwelcome intruders. Countless had sought to end her life, only to meet the same stony fate as those who preceded them. Upon reaching out to touch one of the statues, she recognized the likeness of a woman from the nearby village. This villager had arrived with a blade, seeking vengeance for her husband's transformation into stone. The frozen countenance of the statue conveyed the unyielding fury of its former living form.\n\nShe hears a noise in the distance of the wind and quickly hides behind one of the pillars. After hearing someone land, the sound of footsteps walking toward the noise stops as the invisible person becomes visible. He hears faint breathing coming from the pillar where Clardusa is hiding. He holds his blade behind the pillar around her neck with the pointy part on her cheek, causing small blood to come out from her cheek. As the blood falls into a puddle with a drop, her eye sees his reflection in the water below her, but it is small enough so he can't see her, but she gets a good look at him.\n\nThe individual was wearing a distinctive ensemble of mythical items. They donned the helm of darkness, a gift from Gaydes, and the harpe sword made of Adamantine, bestowed by Reus. Their winged sandals were a treasure from Julimes, while the mirror shield was a divine offering from the goddess Anithea. Lastly, the Hesperides gave them the kibisis, a special sack for carrying objects. Considering their possession of these extraordinary items, one might surmise that this person is a demigod. Furthermore, it seems likely that they had located Anithea's residence and may have been sent by her to carry out a sinister task, possibly involving the gruesome act of decapitation.\n\nShe needs to think fast. Trying to attack him head-on would most likely result in her death. He asked who she was, not knowing she was the Gorgon he sought. The Gorgon calls herself Minerva and asks for his name, to which he replies, \"Perball.\" He tells her he's looking for Gorgon Clardusa, who is in this domain, and then asks why she is not turned to stone like the others. Minerva tells him that she recently arrived at the forest before him, and the Gorgon usually naps inside the temple at this hour.\n\nAfter a brief pause, he expresses his gratitude for the information and instructs her to depart the woods, which she readily acquiesces. Perball then stealthily makes his way to the temple, utilizing his winged shoes to move silently and turning himself invisible as he enters. Taking advantage of his absence, Clardusa ascends to her temple by taking flight.\n\nAs she gently rests her head on the excellent, ancient stone, she strains to hear the faint echoes reverberating from the temple's depths. To conceal her presence, she artfully positions a decoy version of herself in the dimly lit interior, expertly crafted to mimic her form. Through this clever subterfuge, Perball would be convinced that he has stumbled upon the slumbering Gorgon, complete with convincing, pig-like snoring sounds.\n\nUsing the mirror to guide him, Perball got close to Clardusa's body, and then, with one fell swoop, he beheaded the \"gorgon\" with his blade. Perball put the head in the sack as he left the temple. After hearing the noise, Clardusa let out a sigh of relief. She could hear the rhythmic flapping of wings as Perball, the troublemaking pixie, flew away from her home. When she was finally confident that the coast was clear, Clardusa called out to the two hidden creatures. Emerging from their hiding spots were two remarkable creatures.\n\nThe first was a magnificent winged horse named Pegasus, its presence exuding grace and majesty. The second was a tiny, peculiar winged piglet named Chrysaor, its appearance contrasting sharply with that of Pegasus. Notably, Chrysaor carried a gleaming golden sword strapped to its back, an unexpected sight given its diminutive size. The two are Posiwin's twin sons. Clardusa gave birth to them a few years ago from her mouth. At first, they repulsed her because she was the sea god's kin. They were immune to being turned to stone. Eventually, she got used to them as they kept her company and prevented her from going insane.\n\nChrysaor approached his mother with concern as he noticed a small amount of blood on her face. He gently hugged her and licked the blood, worried about her well-being. Clardusa reassured him, and even Pegasus, the gentle creature, nuzzled the Gorgon, also showing his concern. With a smile, she comforted them, letting them know that everything was alright and no harm would come to her. In return, she embraced her sons, expressing gratitude for their care.\n\nPerball, still in the forest, was alerted by Anithena, who appeared before him. She told him that he had failed to kill the Gorgon. Perball denied this and then pulled out the head as proof to her, only for her to point out that the head was a fake. He quickly turned his head to discover that it was nothing but a clever trick. The false head was a stuffed imitation, filled with fur and slithering snakes that viciously bit his hand, forcing him to release it. Filled with fury, he plotted his next move to confront the Gorgon again, realizing that this formidable creature was not as easily defeated as he had initially presumed.\n\n \n\nUpon their return to the temple, Perball and the soldiers dispatched by Anithea were met with a relentless downpour. Suddenly, a blinding light cut through the rain, illuminating a previously unnoticed statue with its imposing wings outstretched, seeming to protect the ancient temple. Undeterred, they pressed forward, entering the dimly lit temple and seeing torches flickering on the walls. A sudden, chilling sound shattered the stillness, and before they could react, one of the soldiers was struck from behind, falling lifeless into the water. The gorgon emerged stealthily, her lethal arsenal at the ready - a bow, arrows, and a menacing sword. The soldiers lunged forward to confront the gorgon. Yet, their valiant efforts were swiftly met with a swift and deadly counterattack as the gorgon wielded a razor-sharp blade concealed on her back, mowing them down with terrifying precision.\n\nPerball hides in the temple walls, using the mirror shield to make the gorgon think he is there as it hits its arrows at the shield. Perball, using a different shield, waits for the monster to come to him. The monster slithers more and more to where he is, and just as the gorgon is next to him, a quick swing from the sword beheads the beast. He hears a squeal like a pig as the decapitated head starts running around. When looked at in the shield's reflection, the head was a tiny piglet with fake snakes on the head. He tries to run but trips due to his legs, which are bleeding from the wound. The decapitated body removes its disguise as a winged horse grabs the Pig and throws him to its back. Said Pig, holding him tight and not letting go. They run outside the temple, with the piglet squealing for his mom's help.\n\nClardusa, startled by the commotion, elegantly descended from the sky and discovered Chyroar in distress. As she drew near, she noticed the crimson trail of blood seeping from his wounded legs, inflicted by the treacherous Perball. Without hesitation, Clardusa plunged her brass fingers into her flesh, unleashing a radiant healing energy to mend her son's grievous injury. Unbeknownst to her, Perball, shrouded in invisibility, stealthily advanced toward them, closing in from behind. With malicious intent, he gripped the nape of Clardusa's neck, preparing to deliver a fatal blow with his menacing blade. Suddenly, with a thunderous impact, Pegasus intervened, lashing out with a powerful kick that forced Perball to release his grip. Consequently, Perball's helmet tumbled from his head, exposing his visage and dispelling his invisibility.\n\nClardusa, with her heart pounding in her chest, seizes the fleeting opportunity and takes flight with Chyroar tightly clutched in her arms. Perball, his mind a whirlwind of emotions, watches with rage and helplessness as the gorgon escapes his grasp. As Pegasus swoops down in a valiant attempt to intercept Clardusa, Perball, fueled by fury and determination, regains his senses just in time to fend off the majestic horse's attack. With a calculated and powerful blow from his shield, he incapacitates Pegasus, sending the noble creature crashing down in a cloud of dust.\n\nHis gaze locked onto Clardusa, a smoldering ember of vengeance raging inside him. Perball grasps his sword with steely resolve and flings it at the fleeing gorgon. The blade strikes true, piercing Clardusa's left wing, eliciting a painful and eerie shriek from her. Despite the unbearable torment, she clings to Chyroar with unyielding determination as they plunge further into the depths of the ancient forest. Determined to finish the beast, Perball dashes into the woods to claim her head and present it to the king.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"54516907\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"beheading\", \"Victim\": \"soldier\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Clardusa\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"slashing\", \"Victim\": \"soldiers\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Clardusa\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"beheading\", \"Victim\": \"piglet\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Clardusa\"}, \"death_event_4\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"fall\", \"Victim\": \"Pegasus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Perball\"}, \"death_event_5\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"piercing\", \"Victim\": \"Clardusa\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Perball\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 39728892, "full_story": "\n    Before the Trojan war, but after Aphrodite and her lost love, Adonis, there was me. Luctus Sine Lumen. I have never found a place to belong with people, I reside far outside of Athens, along the edge of the woods near an eerie lake and a field of flowers. At this time I am about 22, My parents had never really been around. My mother left when I was young, and my father drank all the time so, I found my interest in painting and sculpting by the age of six. \n\n\n\n    No one ever seemed to really want to see my paintings, but I think they're pretty good. I never had any friends- ok well I had one. Adrina, but she was busy taking care of her new family- so I usually just talk to the gods. When my father was around, he told me to never depend on Aphrodite. He told me over and over again that she was good-for-nothing and claimed that love was a facade for fools that are enamored by others. My entire life, my father had belittled the goddess of love, and the idea of it in overall- since, of course, he had been left by his own love. Not that I care of course, I never really paid him any attention, but even then, i still don't really trust the idea of love. I've had crushes of course, but I've never confessed, or dated anyone, or gotten married. I've just been by myself.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    My heart has always been in my sculptures and paintings. Never on people. When I was painting, my brush ran over my canvas several times again and again, until it was obvious that I was painting a woman. It was Aphrodite. I had no idea why I suddenly wanted to pay tribute to the goddess in such a manner, but I did so anyway. I suppose I had a childish idea of hope for true love. I spent days painting this woman. Her beauty in the painting was of course- unmatched, and she was watching. The gods could hear someone's prayers to them, their deepest desires, and even if i wasn't aware in the moment, there was the wish in the back of my mind that I would fall in love- maybe to someone as beautiful as the people in my portraits. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n     Aphrodite took great pleasure and pride in seeing such an act of devotion to her- even if I've never had the opportunity to go and rightfully pray in any of her temples, I still spent a very long time depicting someone of enormous perfection that looked similarly to the goddess. Because of this action, Aphrodite, who was of a great ego, felt the need to grant a wish of mine, and since I had longed deep down to feel what it is to be truly loved, she was going to prove she capable of granting such a desire. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n     Aphrodite had decided what she was going   to do for me so, she waited, and watched me for a while, catching all of my small comments about how i liked the different outcomes of different pieces. At one point, I had been sculpting the figure of a man, out of clay and rock. The goddess could hear all of my comments-- much to my dismay. Ones about how gorgeous this man was compared to all of the rest of humanity. It was then that she planned it out. On the first day of detailing this man, she would give the sculpture personality, on the second, compassion, the third, a brain, on the fourth, she gave him desire and love for his sculptor, on the very last day that I had worked on the sculpture, when I completed it, the goddess would give the statue life.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    I threw myself forward slightly, just enough to wrap my arms around the sculpture. I had sat there for a while, until I felt the warmth of another's skin against my own, and until I felt the pressure of someone else's arms snaking around me. It's as if you can feel how genuine someone is by how they hug- how tightly, how long, and by what they say to you in such a situation. In this instance, what was said by him would stay with me for an eternity, long after I pass on. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\"I can see you...\" \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n     I took a minute, but when I finally let my eyes drift upwards, to see who was hugging me, my breath staggered a little and the corners my lips tugged hesitantly into a smile as my glossy, teary eyes swiftly cleared up. There I saw eyes of a deep green color- like jade stones. My eyes scanned around. I cant believe I didn't recognize him immediately. I designed him. The sharp jawline and the shape of this perfect nose belonged to my statue. I gasped and reached my hands up to touch the man's face. He was given life from Aphrodite,and he would from now on, only live for his sculptor. Always. Forever. I was speechless, but I could see the man's eyes looking at me, and then the creation spoke again, \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\"You're...gorgeous\"\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    I've never heard such a thing said to me before- under any circumstances at all ever- especially not by a man I sculpted and spent over a week to perfect....or by a man at all. My mouth opened slightly and I tried to stand myself up, earning the assistance of the other man. Once we were both stood up, I sort of regretted making him so muscular and tall. Outside the window were two crows. To avoid awkward eye contact, for a moment, I just stared out at the birds- watching as another bird joined, the three birds stood in the grass for quite a bit before two of them left, leaving one by itself in the field. After a few seconds of that, I turned back to the stranger, having worked up the courage to speak.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\"Do you have a name?\" I spoke in a little bit more of a hushed voice than the other man did-but even so, it was loud enough to hear\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\"Aphrodite called me 'Novellus\"\" the other responded. Novellus was a name that suited this man quite well- In my opinion at least.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\"Novellus. It is perfect. My name is Luctus. Luctus Sine Lumen\" I answered the taller man immediately.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n     After we introduced ourselves, I allowed Novellus to stay in my house with me. We often picked fruits together, Nove had often tossed apples towards me, which I thought was rather odd, since no apple trees grow around us, but I chose not to think on it too much. As months went by, I fell in love with the 'son' of Aphrodite, just as the goddess herself intended. Everything went perfectly. Novellus adjusted to life as a human man and learned how to pick up on social cues. He took care of me every single day. In the winters, he would hardly leave my side. Seasons passed, and we both resided in our little home in the forest, selling some of the artwork to some locals in the town, and laying on the forest's soft grass base to watch the stars and the clouds each day. We loved each other, and always would until the end of time, and as for Novellus, he told me he would see me each and every day, until he couldn't. Even if he were going blind, he would never wish to look upon anything but me, which was far more than I ever could have asked for. \n\n\nThis is meant to be a short story. So there will be some time skips in this chapter.\n\n\n    within the year after I created him, he stayed with me. He refused to leave my side, and I don't think I wanted him to. I would say things like, \"Follow me. We are going to go pick up some foods from the city\" or maybe some days I would ask him to come with me to pick flowers and care for the wildlife and always. \nAlways \nhe would do it. He always went with me. That man is the best thing that has ever happened to me and everyday, I thank Aphrodite for granting him to me. \n\n\n \n\n\n    A year or two after that, things were great, but the fourth year after I created him, a war between the cities began. The Trojan war. It was horrible. Me and Novellus stayed in the countryside. We avoided the war, and the blood and gore as best we could. Nothing was worse than going into town and seeing men being carried into their homes, returning from the battlefield wounded or even dead. Blood dropped from their bodies as if it was water. It became so normal after a while, but people never stopped screaming. Their screams still ring in my ears sometimes. The children were always the worst to oversee. They cried. More than I thought was possible for any living thing. I felt sort of guilty- because I never had to worry about losing my lover. He was immortal. I don't think I could handle it if I lost him. \n\n\n \n\n\n    Months passed and it was fine- although the animals began to act weird. But only around our home. Plants started dying and we had to go further and further every time we needed to get some. It must be Artemis who has decided to cause havoc in the forest. It was well known that Aphrodite hated her because their beliefs were far different- as a result, she often killed Artemis' followers or made them fall in love, but I don't know why she would want anything to do with me or Novellus. \n\n\n \n\n\n    This went on for a very long time and the war got closer and closer to the town, and forest in which we resided. Novellus constantly offered to go and fight them off- to keep our home safe and protect me- but that was unnecessary. He insisted every day that he should go help fight the war. I was somewhat worried what that kind of experience would do to him. I knew he was immortal but an immortal life is not worth living if you are haunted by the lives you have taken. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"My dove, let me go help the town fight. I cant die, you know that.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I know, Nove, but I know what war does to people, and it's not worth it.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Well then let me go aid the wounded\" \n\n\n \n\n\n    I agreed to this idea because I know how desperately he wanted to help. It was torture to have to just stay on the side and watch people die and families mourn. He went to go help the injured every day he could, but the war drew closer. He left one morning a little earlier than usual to go help and I went into the other side of town to give some of the folks the plants I found deep in the gardens we grew, since our closer ones were dying. I liked to listen to the townspeople gossip as well. It was usually very interesting to hear but this time, it was anything but. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Did you hear? One of those woodland boys went to fight in the war\"\n\n\n \n\n\nI immediately stopped. My head turned like the shadow of a sundial. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"What?\" \n\n\n \n\n\n    When I spoke, I thought i sounded fine, but the lady I had said it to- the way she reacted seemed like she was looking at a child who burst into tears. She looked at me with such regret. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Oh wait! You're that boy! One of the ones from the fore-\" I cut her off. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"What did you just say...\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\"I- uhh...did you not know? Your friend...he left for the war a few hours ago\"\n\n\n \n\n\n    The way I stared at her must have made her feel some sort of sympathy because she looked like she wanted to rub my shoulder like distant relative would when they see you for the first time in a year. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I responded sharply. My slight anger that he disobeyed me immediately changed to pure worry. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Well the war came closer to the woods first, and when he overheard that he immediately left towards it.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n    There was such a mix of emotions I was feeling, and so many thoughts in my head that I couldn't hear what she was saying after that- I had tuned everything out. I wasn't in control of my body anymore. I blinked and I was running back home. I tripped over my own feet plenty of times and stumbled more than I could count. I couldn't see anymore. It was all so blurry and my face was wet. I was crying. Not crying. Sobbing. I made it to the field before the forest and already there were plenty of the dead. I ran there and I didn't see any living soldiers, only dead ones. Some from our army and some from the other's. When I tripped for the last time, it hurt to get up. \n\n\n \n\n\n    I glanced up from my spot on the ground and I saw him. He was knelt on the ground in front of the creek. The water ran red with blood. A doe was laying dead in the water. It was obvious the soldiers had no mercy for the animals. I tried to pick myself up and I managed to make it right next to him. He was frozen. He stared at the water and his hands were shaking. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Nove?\"\n\n\n\n\"Novellus!\" \n\n\n \n\n\n     I shouted a bit as I shook him but he didn't respond. I turned and looked around as grabbed his hand and held it tightly. I could see the house was a mess, the door was broken and things had been shattered. The wildlife was almost all gone. I knew the doe that was in the creek, I knew half of these soldiers that were bleeding out onto the grass- painting it a shade of crimson. \n\n\n \n\n\n    I tried to get Novellus to get up and come inside with me- I even tried to take him to the town but he didn't move. After that, I gave up. I let my hand caress his left cheek and I wiped the blood off of his face, then the water was used to clean his hands. I cleaned his smooth skin of the blood and regret, but I knew he would be different after this. That's when I heard shouting. People shouting. More soldiers. \n\n\n \n\n\n    This bit was mostly blurry. One of the men tried to pull me away from him, but I screamed and cried and remained next to him. He was alive. I could feel his hand gripping mine, but he wasn't completely conscious. I pushed the soldier over and managed to knock him out. I tried once again to pull him. The only thing that left my mouth were soft mumbles and cries.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Novellus...please. You have to get up. Please.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n    At that point I was on my feet, pulling at his arm- and then I wasn't. I felt a sharp pain in my gut and I fell to my knees again. I touched my stomach and it was blood. I was bleeding. Behind me was a soldier who had just removed his sword, freshly coated in my blood. I couldn't really speak- I just made incoherent soft whimpers and gasps of pain. It hurt. It hurt so bad. \n\n\n \n\n\n    That was when he turned around. He was finally conscious again, as I was being dragged by one of my arms, across the grass. There were about 3 soldiers there now. Novellus immediately grabbed the sword that had been next to him and sliced one of them completely in half, the second one was decapitated, and the last one, he stabbed him- in the same way I was stabbed. He knelt by my side and I cried softly. \n\n\n \n\n\n    My love tried to quiet me and calm me. He whispered and held me in his arms. I could tell he was panicked and manic. I paused after a while and winced. I nearly forgot I was bleeding. The only thing I could do was watch his face. His beautiful face. I could tell he knew I was in pain. He knew I was dying. But he refused to believe it. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Nove...\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\"No- shhh stop. Don't say anything- you're going to be fine.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n    I held his cheek with as much strength as I could get and I pulled his face to mine. We were covered in dirt, blood and sweat. Our foreheads met and both of our eyes shut. \n\n\n \n\n\n    I heard him cry. I did not speak to him but I opened my eyes and pressed a kiss onto his lips and cried with him. There is a saying I've heard before. Est quaedam flere voluptas which translates to- there is a certain pleasure in weeping. there is. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"You don't have to follow me this time, Nove\" \n\n\n \n\n\n    After I spoke that he seemed to weep harder and hold me tighter. I couldn't really hear him. But he was speaking. It all became fuzzy. \n\n\n \n\n\n    I bleed the blood of man. I know this because i have seen it. I did not think I would belong in this world like others do, so I tried to leave. I am not an immortal creation of the gods like he is. I designed him and the gods granted my most valued wish. I worry what he will do when I've gone from here. \n\n\n \n\n\n     I'm sorry, my love- I know you will be upset with me, and then with the gods that created you. I am not meant to live forever, and you are not meant to die forever.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLast chapter Les gooooo\n\n\n    Even though I was gone, I still felt him holding me. When I died, I was allowed by the gods to watch over him for a while, though once I passed on, or given a new life, I would forget what I saw in these moments, there was so much I wanted to say. \n\n\n \n\n\n    He held my body for the longest time, while he wept. I've never seen him cry before. He screamed. He shouted for his mother, the one who gave him life- Aphrodite. He told her to bring me back, and then he begged her to end his life. \n\n\n \n\n\n    Aphrodite rarely ever answered wishes in person. But she stepped out into the forest from behind a tree. Near her, there was a Stag. She raised her arm and the deer approached the creek and sat. Everyone in the forest was in mourning. \n\n\n \n\n\n    The goddess then walked towards Novellus. She held his face with a gentle hand- like a motherly touch. Here, he begged her again, to kill him...to which she refused. He cried and didn't stop hugging my body. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"Please mother!\" \n\n\n \n\n\n    The man raised his hand and placed his palm over Aphrodite's hand that was on his face. She seemed empathetic.\n\n\n \n\n\n\"You are not alone in your anguish, child, but a bitter heart eats its owner.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n    Everyone knew about Aphrodite's experience with heartbreak and grief because of what happened to Adonis, but in this moment, he, of course was thinking selfishly. The ones who weep always claim no one knows how they feel, but she knows how you feel, beloved- I know how you feel. \n\n\n \n\n\n    I was reincarnated a few times and had some good lives but I never saw him again. There was not a single moment I didn't wish to somehow come across him and stay with him forever. It's the most painful when you remember everything. When you remember what his voice sounds like and how his hands felt holding you. I'm always going to try and go back to him. Every single time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDum Spiro Spero \n\n", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"39728892\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"doe\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unknown\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"sword\", \"Victim\": \"narrator\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unknown\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"narrator\", \"Perpetrator\": \"unknown\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 51106009, "full_story": "First off, I didn't get my head chopped off by Perseus. He was being used as somewhere to hang drying linens, until Stheno said it 'interrupted the flow of the room', and made me drag him outside with the others. He's currently surrounded by a patch of crimson and amethyst geraniums, his face forever locked in a soundless, eternal scream. I think birds might be nesting in it, as little cheeps keep coming from it. I would look, but well, I don't want to kill a baby bird.\n\n \n\nMaybe Euryale will look for me. She's much more inclined to do what I ask of her, as long as I haven't annoyed her about anything else, like untidiness, or leaving dead soldiers in odd corners. To be fair to her, when it was one or two, it looked quite stylish - when it gets to double figures, it looks obsessive. Bit like any collection really. So I try to keep them down to a minimum - some are in the gardens, others lined like a warning to the cave's entrance, some... some we grind to dust beneath our feet. But only on really bad, angry days.\n\n \n\nIt's exhausting to be angry all the time.\n\n \n\nIt's starting to rain, and I can feel the snakes wriggling in discontent, hissing sharply. Shame. I like to feel the rain on my face. Prefer it to sunlight. It gets heavier, soft as kisses on my brows. The snakes are getting more fidgety, tongues flitting out at my ears, deliberately annoying me. 'Fine,' I mutter, and start slinking back to the cave.\n\n \n\nThat's when I see him, on the edge of the beach. He's dressed in rough, practical clothes, but they are ripped and salt-streaked, soaked through. I can't see his face - he is lying like a ragdoll on his side, and it is obscured by sodden strands of onyx and silver. His body suggests a life of transience - slim firm thighs and well-muscled calves that suggested a lot of walking, a slightly soft belly that suggested a lack of physical labour and a fondness for food and drink. His arms, long and gangly, ended in hands with slim fingers. The nails were short and neat, though one was recently broken, blood welling underneath the cuticle, like he had been scrabbling at something. \n\n \n\nA few metres to the side were some shards of wood. A shipwreck then. I knelt beside him, lowering my head to see if - yes, his chest was rising slightly, and if I listened carefully I could hear his heartbeat, weak but stable. I got to my feet, and without thinking it through, scooped the unconscious man into my arms.\n\n \n\nI left him on the kitchen table, and that's where my sisters found me. Stheno sighed. 'This isn't a stray cat or dog we can just take in and look after you know?' she chided.\n\n \n\n'I know,' I mumbled, irritated as that's not something I could do anymore. \n\n \n\nEuryale looked him over, picking at his clothes. 'No rings, no pendants, no weapons, no mysterious birthmarks signifying that he's a scion of the gods. What do we think, legitimate castaway or something to fuck us over?'\n\n \n\nStheno sighed again. 'Who knows?' She tutted again. 'Why did you bring him in again Medusa?'\n\n \n\nI had got distracted by the candlelight reflection off the man's skin, like watching sunlight bounce off a copper kettle. I looked up to find them both smirking at me. 'I- I don't know!' I could feel my snakes coil and hiss. 'Just - just shut up!'\n\n \n\n'Pretty sure we didn't say anything,' Euryale mutters, but she turns back to the man. 'Shit, I think he's coming to. Pass me that glass of water, and you two get out, just in case he's up to something.'\n\n \n\nThe man's brows (thick and black, like caterpillars) moved together, and he sat up suddenly. He started coughing, and Stheno grabbed me and jumped back out of the room, out of his eyesight but we could still see him, hidden by the darkness. He sat up and turned his head. 'Where- where am I?' he asked, his voice parched and rusty.\n\n \n\nEuryale stood up straight, all nine-foot of her, wings wrapped behind her. She smiled at him through tusks. 'You are at the house of the Gorgons, so I wouldn't try anything.' We could see her smile start to falter. A look of confusion had settled on the man's (quite handsome) features, but there was no look of abject terror or fear, not like Euryale was used to.\n\n \n\nThere was silence for a while. 'I am sorry, but I don't know what you would be expecting me to be trying. To be honest, I'm just so grateful I'm safe and not yet in Hades. Drowning is a horrible way to go.' He cleared his throat. 'Thank you, just thank you' he said softly, his voice soft and sweet, musical like the chiming of bells. 'May I have a drink of water please?'\n\n \n\nEuryale's mouth fell open, and I had to swallow down a laugh. She looked so confused and foolish. 'Um, yes,' she said, bustling with the cups and carafe on the side. Euryale is always happiest when she is given something practical to do. She held out a cup towards him, but he made no move to take it. 'Here,' she said brusquely.\n\n \n\nHe moved a hand in her general direction. 'Um, if you could-'\n\n \n\n'Oh shit, he's blind!' shouted out Stheno, not only deafening me but also revealing we were there. \n\n \n\nHis head turned towards the noise, and I could see his face for the first time. He had eyes the colour of earth, but the pupils were off centre. He smiled, but it looked sad. 'Um, yes I am. Since I was a child.' He turned back to Euryale. 'I am Theofylaktos, but Theo please. I was travelling from Athens when the boat I took passage from was hit by a storm.'\n\n \n\n'What were you doing in Athens?' asked Euryale, guiding the cup to his hand. I could see he didn't shudder at her touch, though it must have felt cold and reptilian. \n\n \n\n'I am a storyteller.'\n\n \n\n'And that's a job is it?' said Stheno.\n\n \n\nTheo looked sheepish. 'Yes. Admittedly not a particular prestigious or lucrative one, but-'\n\n \n\n'And people listen to stories? As if they haven't got anything better to do?' scoffed Stheno.\n\n \n\n'Really? We're doing this?' I said angrily, before I could stop myself. His gaze flicked to my direction and I could see his smile grow warmer. I ignored the arched eyebrow that Euryale was giving me, and the snigger I could hear from Stheno. I took a deep breath. 'I should probably get dinner. How are you with fish, Theo?'\n\n \n\n'Well, I prefer them on the plate rather than beside me, but yes, fish for dinner sounds nice.'\n\n \n\nI could hear Stheno griping behind me about 'having to cook it first', but I ignored her and left. For some reason the cave, usually so comfortable and safe, suddenly felt stifling and cramped. The darkness suddenly felt too warm, like a coat I didn't need but couldn't take off. I needed air.\n\n \n\nI felt that itching underneath my skin. I needed to run.\n\n \n\n*\n\n \n\nI feel that if a man were writing about it, he'd start talking about the scenery. The way the guttering candlelight flickered on the walls, like spirits. Or that the precious jewels in the ceiling shone like stars. Or talk about it in the vaguest terms, like 'he moved in her', or 'as relentless as the sea, a force of nature'.\n\n \n\nThere was nothing natural about it. My ears were full of his grunting and my own panicked heartbeat. I couldn't see anything except his eyes, which swallowed everything. He was heavy, far too heavy, and I felt like all the air was being smothered out of me. My lungs felt full of concrete, and I was choking on a scream I couldn't get out. I could hear my bones grinding together where he held my wrists, and it hurt. From the waist down it hurt so much, like I had been torn in half. \n\n \n\nAfterwards he said nothing. Just adjusted his belt and his robes and left. I lay there, exhausted, body and mind numb. And then a flash of light, Athena in all her glory.\n\n \n\n'You have sinned-' she began to proclaim.\n\n \n\n'Where were you?' I snarled. I bared my teeth, and could feel my hands twitch. I burned with the desire to rush at her, to claw out her eyes. 'Where the fuck were you?'\n\n \n\nPerfect golden eyebrows creased, and alabaster skin wrinkled ever so slightly. 'Excuse me, you can't-'\n\n \n\n'Did you only just realise what was going on? Did you just leave me, when you could have shown up at any time?'\n\n \n\nHer face grew cruel, her mouth scar across a landscape. 'What you have done is an affront-'\n\n \n\n'WHAT I HAVE DONE?!' I screeched. I gnashed my teeth, and I looked at her, my blood boiling. 'I have done nothing.' I laughed, the sound bitter and venomous. 'You think I wanted this?'\n\n \n\n'SILENCE' she thundered, the sound hitting like a rain of fire. 'Beastly, beastly thing! Disgusting, corrupt...'\n\n \n\nOn and on she went, a thousand insults as I felt my body twist and snap, break and reshape. I could see my hair fall out, and heard the hissing around my ears. I saw my nails lengthen, my skin harden and become scales.\n\n \n\n'You think this frightens me?' I goaded, the pain making me brash and bold.\n\n \n\n'This isn't your punishment,' Athena said icily. 'Loneliness is.'\n\n \n\n*\n\n \n\nI got back, fish in tow, and a few herbs from the garden. I found my sisters around the table, watching Theo tend to the fire in the hearth. He moved with confidence, and he was chatting away. I wondered if he would feel so comfortable if he could see who he was talking to.\n\n \n\n'Fish,' I say, wincing at my lack of articulacy, and I shove the fish on a stick, over the fire. I cover it in oil and a few herbs that I crush between my fingers.\n\n \n\n'Smell nice,' he says, and then his eyebrows rise. 'The herbs, they smell nice.'\n\n \n\nI can't see my sisters to know they are smirking. I know they can see the blush on my cheeks. 'Bit of thyme.'\n\n \n\nStheno barks out a laugh, which she tries to pass off as a cough. Euryale is far less subtle. 'Well, we need to do a couple of chores, you guys watch the fish, yeah?' I see a whole conversation go on in a few seconds of eye contact and eyebrow wiggling, and then they are gone.\n\n \n\n'Older sisters?' Theo asked.\n\n \n\n'Yeah, yes. How could you tell?'\n\n \n\nHe smiled. 'A guess.' He sighed. 'They remind me a little of my sisters.'\n\n \n\nI laughed. 'If I were your sisters, I would take such offense at that.'\n\n \n\nHe turned to face me. I know he couldn't see me, but it certainly felt strange to look a person in the face. 'What do they look like?'\n\n \n\nI felt uneasiness, and it felt as if something was stuck in my throat. 'Um, why...'\n\n \n\nTheo moved a hand, as if he were going to touch me, then withdrew it. 'I know I was a bit slow earlier... I'm going to blame that on the nearly drowning thing... but I have heard of the Gorgons.' He shuffled his chair closer, dropping his voice. 'Forgive me, I'm a storyteller, but now I'm in a story of my own, and it's-'\n\n \n\n'What?' I ask, dreading his answer.\n\n \n\n'Well, it's exciting!' he says, almost breathless. He bites and wets his bottom lip, and I see a flash of pearly teeth. 'Sorry, I hope I haven't offended.'\n\n \n\n'It's not a nice story,' I say, voice cold as ice. 'This is my life, not a bit of whimsy for your entertainment.'\n\n \n\nHis eyes widen. 'I'm sorry, of course it isn't, I didn't mean...' He sighs. 'I'm sorry.' He taps his fingers nervously on his leg. \n\n \n\n'You say you have heard about us. Do you think you know everything? Do you think you know us?'\n\n \n\nHe shakes his head. 'Of course I don't, how could I?' He sits up straighter. 'But I'd like to.'\n\n \n\n'Not afraid we'll eat you?' I hiss.\n\n \n\nHe smiles, but it's a twisted thing. 'Maybe a little. But I'm more scared of gods than of monsters.' He stood up suddenly. 'Wasn't always blind, didn't have to rely on other people telling me things about  my  life.' He stormed out of the room, hands trailing the wall.\n\n \n\nI heard Euryale tut behind me. 'Smooth Med, smooth.'\n\n \n\nSorry this took so long, real life got in the way. As usual, all comments/kudos/feedback welcome. Hope you enjoy.\n\n'Smooth Med, smooth.' I heard her words, but I refused to think about what she had meant by them. 'Fish will be done soon.'\n\n \n\nThere was a clatter from further within the cave, an unmanly yelp and the sound of falling stone. 'Didn't expect something to be there, sorry,' came Theo's voice, penitent and sheepish.\n\n \n\n'Told you it was getting cluttered,' Euryale remarked. She began to shuffle onto the chair next to me, budging me with her hip. 'Go help him, I'll look after the fish. Give you a chance to apologise too.' I muttered something about not needing to apologise, my snakes hissing in discontent, but Euryale flicked my ear. 'Go on, bugger off.' \n\n \n\nI found Theo very cautiously standing near where the statue had toppled, one hand on the wall, slightly bent at the waist, other hand feeling in the air around him. His head turned to me as I approached. 'I'm sorry, I was being an ass,' he said. 'Now I'm breaking your things.'\n\n \n\n'Never liked that one anyway,' I said, my voice deceptively light. 'Fish will be ready soon.' I gently take his hand. 'Want me to guide you?'\n\n \n\nHis hand was soft and warm, and didn't shake at my touch. 'It sometimes takes me a while to get my bearings in a new place.' He moved off the wall, moving closer to me. He smelt of salt and also citrus. 'I won't be a burden to you for long Medusa.'\n\n \n\nI almost trip up over my own feet. 'You know what I am?' I ask.\n\n \n\n'Your sisters told me their names, and I could work out the rest.' His hand tightened in mine. 'I know  who  you are. I know that you were the one who took me from off the beach. I know that you can't hurt me in the way that you can hurt others.' He smiled softly. 'I know that you caught fish, and are cooking it for me to eat, and it's been a long time since someone has been so kind to me.'\n\n \n\nI can feel my face start to heat, and the snakes in my hair start to wriggle closer to it, a soft susurration caused by their movements. Theo's head shifts to one side, listening. 'So it is true...' he says softly. \n\n \n\nI jump away from him, as if burned. What, did I think I would be able to hide? Even without being seen, there were many things that made me monstrous. 'This way,' I say, letting my voice be a guide. It's hard to see clearly in the gloom, but he almost looks disappointed, but why he would be I do not know. \n\n \n\n*\n\n \n\nTheo proves to be useful with his hands, good at weaving and cooking. Stheno, with the tact of a stone wall, asked him why he was so skilled at women's work, and he only smiled and said 'no one wants to train a blind soldier'. \n\n \n\nHe told stories. Of gods. Of monsters. Of mortals. Some were short and silly - some long, epic tales. All were a delight to listen to. \n\n \n\nWe were sitting on the beach, backs against a rock, basking in the sun, which had become a habit of late. There was little space between us, and I could feel the heat coming off his side. It took all my control not to lean into it, to wrap myself around him, like the reptile people think I am. \n\n \n\n'...and that's when the ship sank. Bloody sirens,' he finished, leaning back and closing his eyes. He smiled. 'Now I am here, so can't complain I guess.'\n\n \n\nI take a deep breath. I want to ask, but I know it's a personal question. 'You said you weren't always blind,' I started, keeping my voice soft. 'How did it come to be so?'\n\n \n\nA frown crossed his features. 'Are you sure you want to hear it? It's a very boring tale, with an angry god.' He sighed. 'Hundreds of such stories.'\n\n \n\n'But it's a story of you, isn't it?' I say, shocked at how breathy I sound. Shocked at how desperately I want to know more of this man. 'How could it be boring?'\n\n \n\nHe barks a laugh, and smiles, and it's like sunshine. He opens his eyes, looks over to me. 'Med, you flatterer.' He laughs again, then his face turns serious. 'I will tell you, if you answer a question about you.'\n\n \n\nI feel my blood turn to ice-water. Surely he can't ask? He can't expect me to tell-\n\n \n\n'What colour are your eyes?' he asks suddenly.\n\n \n\n'Green,' I say automatically. \n\n \n\nHe smiles. 'Thank you, that's a start. But what sort of green?'\n\n \n\nI huff. 'Green.' \n\n \n\n'Yes, but -', and he waves his hands, warming to his theme, '-are they olive-green? Grass in sunlight green? The sea on a calm day green? The green of a forest, the green of emeralds, or the green of Stheno's awful cooking?'\n\n \n\nI make a dismissive noise, echoed by my snakes, who I would almost think are laughing at him. 'I wouldn't say any of that.'\n\n \n\n'That's because you do not have a poet's soul, like I do,' he says, voice sombre with mock solemnity. 'You are incredibly practical, it's almost weaponised.'\n\n \n\nI don't know why, but I reach over to the top of his thigh, resting my claws on top of it. A light enough pressure not to cut but just so he can feel the sharpness of them through the fabric. 'I have many weapons.'\n\n \n\nHe starts to breathe quickly, and his off-centre pupils start to dilate. He looks over to me, and I can see his throat move as he swallows. My own heart seems to be in my mouth, and I feel both hot and cold all over. He licks his lips, and all I want to do is put mine on them and taste him. \n\n \n\n'Med,' his voice is soft, almost reverent. 'I...' He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. \n\n \n\nI move my hand so it's the soft pads of my fingers on him, and I increase the pressure. I move it up slightly higher. I am nervous, but also feel powerful, and it is a confusing mix. 'Is this okay?'\n\n \n\nHe is biting his lip, and it looks as if he is close to shaking. 'Yes, it is, whatever you want...'\n\n \n\nWhat do I want? I want to see this man undone. \n\n \n\nI shuffle to my knees, both hands on him, one hand on his thigh, the other on his chest, over his heartbeat. I lean in, catching his scent, and it makes my mouth water. I mouth at his neck, licking at the skin. I forget the snakes for a moment, heedless as they brush against him. I can hear him whimper, and feel his heart race under my hand. \n\n \n\nMy skin feels too tight but also as if lightning was running through it. A core of molten heat undulates through me, and I  want, I  need ...\n\n \n\nWithout thought I am on top of him, my legs either side of his. My lips have moved onto his, and he is moaning into my mouth, and I swallow the sound greedily. His hands are on my back, and I freeze. He may not be able to see the monster, but he could feel...\n\n \n\n'You feel like polished shell and pearl,' he breathes, and his hands trail across my skin. 'Precious, beautiful...' he whispers, until his lips are busy with mine again. \n\n \n\nIt is no work to move his clothes, to press skin against skin, to welcome him into the deepest, darkest parts of me. It is pleasure, it is power and it is bliss.\n\n \n\nLater, we lie entangled on the sand, the light of the later sun soft but still warming. Our hands are interlinked, and I lean on his chest. \n\n \n\n'Do you still want to know my story?' he asks. I say I do, and he starts to tell me.\n\n \n\n*\n\n\n I lived in a small village by the coast. It was humble, mostly fishermen and their families. I was young, only eight winters, when a man came to our house, asking for alms. \n\n\n \n\n\n Now, my mother was very beautiful. Hair like spun gold, and eyes of sapphires. \n\n\n \n\nWhat was she like though?\n\nKind, very kind.\n\n \n\n\n The man has eyes like the sky at night, and he says he is hungry. And while I can see a wolf, no one else seems to. Not my mother, not my father, nor my sisters. And one day my father is sailing, and my sisters are at the market, he comes again.  \n\n\n \n\n 'Go out,' my mother says, though it doesn't sound like her. Her eyes are dull, and her voice sounds like it is coming from much further away. And I want to stay, but the man looks at me, his eyes like chasms in the earth,  GO  he says, and somehow my feet move without my mind agreeing. \n\n \n\n\n I am by the crossroads by the time I can feel myself in control again, and I feel a bone-crushing weariness. I need to sit, catch my breath, and this takes a few minutes. I realise I am a few miles from home, I must have walked for a good hour. \n\n\n \n\n\n Then I see her. She is tall, taller than any man could be. Skin so white it shines, and hair of garnet piled in delicate braids on her head. She is wearing a cloak of peacock feathers, and I know who she is and I am terrified.  \n\n\n \n\n\n Terrified if my mother is discovered. \n\n\n \n\n\n So I run. It is not a easy path, and I am a small child, weak, and I stumble. But I know I must get to my mother before Hera does, so I run. \n\n\n \n\n\n And I get to the cottage, and I start to scream, to bang on windows. My mother comes out to meet me, hastily dressed, and she catches me as I fall in exhaustion, 'Hera' on my lips. I hear the sound of thunder, and the air is thick with the smell of a storm. \n\n\n \n\n\n My eyes close. When I open them again I can see nothing but blackness. \n\n\n \n\n\n 'Zeus's little look-out, were you?' says a female voice, loud as waves crashing on the shore, a hundred birds in flight. 'You'll never look on anything again.' \n\n\n \n\n*\n\n \n\nHe is silent for a long time after his story, and I hold him tighter. As if my love could heal him, not his sight but his anger. He holds me back, fingers even entwined in my head of snakes, gentle with them.\n\n \n\nWe are both cursed. But now, at least in this moment, we are both blessed.\n\n \n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\n\nDays passed. I am not sure how many. I lost sense of time somewhere between Theo's soft lips and gentle fingers, his sweet sighs and his musical laughter. We argued sometimes, usually about stupid things, but sulks were quick and soon forgotten, usually telling some joke or other that made the other smile.\n\n\n \n\n\nMy sisters did not question his staying, simply moved the patterns of their lives around him. Like he had always been there. He mended things, helped to cook and clean, fished a little, tended to the garden. Helped me identify the birds as we both listened to their song.\n\n\n \n\n\nOne evening he had come back from a walk on the beach and even without improved senses you could sense the anger coming off him. It heated the air around him, a walking flame, and my snakes coiled against my head, almost in fear. Each of his steps were heavy, as if he were stomping. 'What's wrong?'\n\n\n \n\n\nHis face turned towards me, his mouth the line of a knife blade. His features softened instantly, and his shoulders sagged. 'I'm sorry, just had a run-in with a god, and it left me fuming.' I must have gasped, because he shook his head quickly. 'Not him,' he reassured me, knowing me too well. 'Apollo.'\n\n\n \n\n\n'Why, what did he want?'\n\n\n \n\n\nHis face hardened again. 'To offer something he thought I'd want, but at a price I wouldn't pay.' He scoffed. 'The gods really know nothing sometimes.' He turned to me, putting out a hand, waiting for me to take it. I did without thinking, relishing the warmth of his touch. 'Med, you want me to be here, don't you?'\n\n\n \n\n\nI moved closer to embrace him, leaned my face into his neck, kissing it softly. 'Course I do. Is that what you want?'\n\n\n \n\n\nHis arms came round to hold me even closer. 'Med, yes. With all my heart, yes.' He gently drew my head up, and kissed me softly on the lips. 'I love you.' \n\n\n \n\n\nAnd suddenly I knew what this lightness and tightness in my chest had been, when I had been with him or not. Why he was my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night. The physical want I understood, but why I felt calmed by his voice, why I craved his touch, my skin hot and cold underneath it.\n\n\n \n\n\n'I love you,' I whispered. 'It's a bit terrifying.'\n\n\n \n\n\nHe held me tighter. 'Yes, it is,' he conceded, his smile in his voice.\n\n\n \n\n\n*\n\n\n \n\n\nA few days later I was walking along the water's edge, looking for pretty shells to border the vegetable patch, when I sensed him. The air changes when a god walks amongst you. It's as if normal sounds are stopped, and the ether around you starts to hum. There is a cloying sweetness in the air, like burning flowers, and colours dim.\n\n\n \n\n\nI turned and saw someone I had not seen before. He was tall, far taller than a human, with the proportions of a statue. Golden curls tumbled around his head, and his skin shone like the light of the dawn sun.\n\n\n \n\n\n'I am Apollo, God of truth and prophecy, of healing. I am poetry and music made flesh. I am he who is the Sun and the Light.'\n\n\n \n\n\n'You're trespassing.'\n\n\n \n\n\nHe huffed, and his tone became more snipey and less solemn. 'I am a god, we go where we wish.'\n\n\n \n\n\n'Well, go somewhere else.'\n\n\n \n\n\nHe visibly bristled. 'Such insolence. Tell me, does living here do that to everyone? Is it something in the air, or in the food you eat?'\n\n\n \n\n\n'Did you come here for a reason?' I asked, bored.\n\n\n \n\n\nHe turned to face the waves. 'I was here recently. I came to speak to the man who is living with you and your sisters.'\n\n\n \n\n\nI nodded. 'He spoke of it.'\n\n\n \n\n\nSomething flashed across golden eyes. 'What did he say?'\n\n\n \n\n\n'That you offered him something he didn't want.'\n\n\n \n\n\nApollo snarled, showing perfect white teeth. 'I offered him salvation. An end to his hurt.' He folded his arms. 'I offered him his sight.'\n\n\n \n\n\nI felt sick. I had to breathe deeply, use all my will not to fall to my knees in shock. He was offered his sight? To be whole again? So many years of pain and suffering, he could have... then I realised what Apollo was really offering.\n\n\n \n\n\n'He saw through you, didn't he?' I answered, and started to laugh. My snakes started to hiss, adding their own mockery to Apollo. 'A blind man saw right through you.'\n\n\n \n\n\nApollo looked confused. 'What do you mean?'\n\n\n \n\n\n'Athena suggest this to you? Probably not outright, but talked about Theo to you, yes? What better way to keep your legend going than to cure a storyteller?' I advanced towards him, keeping his eyes on mine (I can't kill a god but they still don't like to meet my gaze, I know it causes discomfort). 'But he knew that if he took your offer, he risked the wrath of Hera. And not only that, but he would have to leave me, and he resented being used as a weapon against me.'\n\n\n \n\n\n'He refused outright. He walked away!' Apollo spat out. He looked away. 'I don't understand,' he said, his words quiet and wounded.\n\n\n \n\n\n'Of course you don't, none of you would,' I tell him. My words are calm, but sharp-edged. 'You don't understand self-sacrifice because you don't feel real pain or loss. You know jealousy and desire and pettiness, but you don't know love.' I open my jaws, to show sharp teeth. 'And that's why they will outgrow you.' \n\n\n \n\n\nI am close enough to him now that I could reach out and claw at his perfect skin. It would burn me, but it would be worth it. Except I do not need to, because my words will hurt more.\n\n\n \n\n\n'And they will not worship you.'\n\n\n \n\n\nApollo steps back, and his golden eyes are now red, burning. 'You speak nonsense! You are not immortal, what do you know of anything?'\n\n\n \n\n\n'Then why are you so upset by my words, if they are untrue?' I start to turn away, dismissing him (it is perhaps unwise to dismiss a god, but what more could they do to me?). 'I have things to do.'\n\n\n \n\n\nLater that night I do not talk to Theo about what Apollo said to me. That comes later. We fight, and I ask if he regrets his choice, and his anger is forgotten and he holds me. 'Never,' he whispers. \n\n\n \n\n\nOver the years, he stays. His hair becomes more silver than black, his movements slower and more clumsy. His words do not come to him as quickly as they once did. He has aches and pains, and while Stheno finds him medicines to help, they become less and less effective.\n\n\n \n\n\nHumans are so frail, especially when they are old. It comes to a time when his skin is like paper, wrinkled and delicate. His eyes are now duller and a weaker shade, more the colour of buffed leather than earth now. But his smile still warms up the room and sends shivers through me.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are sitting on the clifftop edge, in one of the most picturesque spots. From it you can see the waves and the endless sky. He turns to me. 'I know you know I am dying.'\n\n\n \n\n\n'You're a storyteller,' I reproach. 'You could lie about it.'\n\n\n \n\n\n'I've never lied to you Med, and I won't start now.' He takes my hand in his, kisses it. 'I don't regret a single thing of my life with you. I just wish I could see you.' He smiles. 'See what kind of green your eyes are.'\n\n\n \n\n\nI panic. Because what if he did see? Saw the monster I was? The reptilian skin, the claws, the mass of writing snakes? And in that moment I can hear Athena's laughter in my head, as I watch in horror as his pupils move, centreing themselves.\n\n\n \n\n\nHe blinks, as if the light hurts him. He looks down at my sitting body, and he starts to laugh. 'It does shine like mother of pearl, I was right!' he exclaims, and for a moment his youth and vitality comes back. He does not look into my face yet, but gently moves his fingers towards my snakes, letting them come to him. 'They're such beautiful patterns. Hello, hello,' he whispers to them.\n\n\n \n\n\nI am trying hard to control my breathing. I want to run, to get away, even let myself fall into the waves below if I have to.\n\n\n \n\n\n'Med, look at me,' he whispers, coaxes.\n\n\n \n\n\n'But you'll die,' I spit out, and I try to sound authoritative but I sound like a child, frightened in the dark. \n\n\n \n\n\n'But I'm dying anyway,' he teases. 'Let me choose the time and the manner.'\n\n\n \n\n\n'I can't be the one who kills you!' I sob.\n\n\n \n\n\n'You're not,' he reassures me. 'I am well aware who is responsible for this, and why.' He grabs my chin and raises it, and though I have my eyes closed I can feel his lips on my eyelids, a benediction. 'But they don't get it, do they? That this is the best I could hope for, a painless death after a life well lived. And a death with the person I love with me.' He kisses me again, desperate. 'Please Med,' he pleads.\n\n\n \n\n\nI open my eyes. I am trapped by the warmth of his gaze. For a few seconds he holds it, then I break away to look down at his feet.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe change is gradual, like a slow-tide, but unstoppable. His flesh turns to grey stone, and it moves up his body. His hands in mine become cold, and he moves away. He keeps his eyes locked onto mine.\n\n\n \n\n\n'Doesn't hurt,' he says. 'If anything, it's nice not to feel the pain. Bit like a warm bath, or going to sleep.' He smiles. 'And your green eyes are beautiful. I don't have the words to describe them.'\n\n\n \n\n\n'You absolute bastard,' I say, laughing.\n\n\n \n\n\n'Well, by the time you meet me in the afterlife, perhaps I'll have come up with something.' He closes his eyes, leans back against the rock. Peaceful. 'I love you. Always have, always will.'\n\n\n \n\n\n'I love you too.'\n\n\n \n\n\nI want to say more, but he cannot hear me. There is only stone where there was once flesh, blood and a beating heart. I stay until the night comes. I shed my tears.\n\n\n \n\n\nThough ultimately my heart is light when I go back into the cave. I do not know how many years I have, but I do not despair. However lonely I am, I have known love, and that will give me succour. And I will see him again.\n\n\n \n\n\nBesides, I beat the bitch after all, didn't I?\n\n\n \n\nSorry this took so long, and I hope you enjoyed.

{"work_id": 52941766, "full_story": "Here's a collection of random Greek (and probably Norse and Egyptian myths) re-told mostly from memory by me! Enjoy! \n\nWell, one day Zeus (the cheater himself) fell in love with a woman named Alcmene and decided, \"Hey, I'd love to get in her pants\" but she was already married to Amphitryon which made Zeus second guess cause he'd never cheat with a married woman (cue hera screaming in the distance), but then Zeus being Zeus decided to just shape shift into her husband and do the deed with her that way, so he bribed the sun god (either Helios or Apollo I've seen versions that say either) to make the night last for an abnormally long time so he could get away with his plan.\n\nAmphitryon came home the next morning, much to the confusion of of Alcmene (they figured out it was Zeus, I forget how but they do). Then fast forward 9 months and Alcmene had to twins, but only one was a demi-god (somehow), Iphicles and some name I can't remember (it gets changed so it doesn't matter). But the fact that one was a child of Zeus made Alcmene nervous that she and or her child who get smite by Hera, so what did she do? Abandon her new born child in a field obviously. But Zeus (Or Athena, depending on what version you read) took him to Hera, and was like, \"Hey I found some random child in a field whos name is....uh, Heracles! You know, meaning glory to Hera! haha\". So Hera decided to nurse him out of pity, (suck up lol). But Heracles apparently bit her so she pushed him away and accidently created the milky way.\n\nHera's goddess milk made him a buff baby then Zeus was like, \"Lol, ok bye, I totally won't cheat on you again\" and brought Heracles back to his mother (You know, the one that abandoned him in a field). But they decided to not abandon him in a field this time and instead raise him, but Hera then realized he was a child of one of her husbands many many many (times like 100) affairs so she decided to try and kill him with 2 random snakes she sent after him but because Heracles was now a buff baby he snapped both there necks and strangled them.\n\n*time skip to when he's no longer a buff baby but a buff teenager/man*\n\nHeracles ended up growing up a pretty normal child, (Unless you count that one time he murdered his music teacher on accident) and married Megara the princess of Thebes (After stopping Thebes from being attacked) until Hera decided \"You know, I haven't been tried to kill or ruin that kids life in a long time, I think it's about time I did that\" and drove him insane causing him to....murder his wife and children with his superhuman strength in a fit of rage...(Like, Hera we know you hate him but that was a bit much).\n\nThen when Hera's inanity magic wore off Heracles freaked out and went to ask the oracle of Delphi how he could make up for his actions, (tbh, I think you're the one who deserved an apology my dude, Zeus and Hera need some serious marriage consoling). The oracle told him to go do what ever 10 things his cousin asked of him for 12 years, then they'd make him a god, (Hera - It was at this moment that she knew, she fucked up). So he traveled to visit Eurystheus (that's his cousin btw), though he didn't want to help his cousin he also wasn't inserted in getting smited by his dad so he went along with it. (Btw, his cousin is on Hera's side during all this cause he too was  p e t t y )\n\nSo his asshole cousin was like, \"Hey dude, so you now how you're for some reason in-debt to me cause you commited some homicide? Well I want you to go slay the Neiman lion because of it\" (he didn't think he'd pull it off). So Heracles went to find and fight the Neiman lion so he could bring it's corpse to his weird ass cousin who diffidently wants him dead. (Also he met this boy who was like, \"You kill that lion and we'll sacrifice one to Zeus but if you die or chicken out, I get sacrificed to Zeus!\" so ig some random town sacrificed a lion to Zeus then). When he found the lion and realized he couldn't shoot it cause it was immune to all weapons he made a plan and strangled it while it slept pretty much. Then returned to his cousin with the dead lion to be assigned his next task.\n\nThis feat made Heracles even more popular and his cousin more jealous (again, petty bitch). So for his next task his cousin told him to kill the Hyrda, so Heracles hopped a ride with this nephew Iolas (I assume on the godly side cause none of them can keep it in there pants) to go to the swamp where the Hyrda lived and kill the it. He figured out that if you cut off one of the Hyrda's head it would simply re-grow (also I think he got attacked by some crab mid fight which is just, random af) it so Iolas helped him make a plan where they would cut of all it's heads then burn the necks so more heads wouldn't grow back and used it's poison blood to make poisons arrows (that'll be important later). But when he returned to his cousin (the petty one), he refused to count this task as one of his 10 labors cause he had helps from Iolas (like I said, petty bitch) so now he had to do 11 labors to make up for this one not counting.\n\nThe next thing he got forced into doing (this was Hera's idea btw) was capturing this magic deer called the ceryneian hind but it was really hard to catch cause it could run super fast, and he couldn't shoot it because it was again, hella fast. So, he just chased it around for a year but one night he found it sleeping and captured it (versions may very). His cousin was hoping Heracles doing this would piss of Artemis cause he captured her sacred animal and there for would smite him or something, and when Heracles was bringing the hind to his petty cousin Artemis (and in some versions Apollo) showed up to give him a what for, (you can hear Hera and Eurystheus laughing in the distance) but after Heracles explained the situation Artemis aloud him to take it as long as he set it after, but his cousin made him give it to some king so he gave it to the king outside and the deer just ran away, once again fouling his idiot cousins plans.\n\nAfter that fiasco his cousin sent him to go deal with this murder boar and was causing a lot of problems for people. So on his way to do that he had dinner with this centaur who's name I can't remember rn and was like, \"Hey, so wanna share some wine?\" to which the centaur was like, \"Well...the only wine I have was a gift from Dionysus and doesn't just belong to me but sure ig\" but then all the other centaurs showed up, got drunk and well....\n\n*One large account of unnecessary centaur murder later*\n\nThe only one he spared was the centaur he had dinner with but then the centaur dropped a poison arrow on his foot and died (skill issue lol). Heracles then visited Chiron (some versions say he got shot too) who told him how to catch the angry death boar. He was told to shove the boar into thick snow so Heracles did, then returned to his asshole cousin with the boar. The next thing his cousin sent him to do was clean the augean stables in one day (they hadn't been cleaned in over 30 years and 1,000's of animals lived there btw). He managed to clean the stables by seducing a nyad (water nymph) and diverting the river to wash they stables clean, (which like, way to poison and entire ecosystem cause you happened to be horny and needed to clean some shit). After that he asked to be paid by the stable owner who refused but bitchy mcbitch face (his cousin) decided to use this as a way to make the labor not count meaning he had to do another to make up for it bringing his number of labors to 12.\n\nAfter that his cousin decided to task him with several counts of harassing random wildlife which included, stymphalian birds, a very pissed off creatan bull and a bunch of flesh eating horses, the mares of Diomedes. Then in-between his 8th and 9th labor he did some more cool stuff like, murder another centaur, invent the olympics, fight some giants, sailed around on the argo with Jason and rescue Prometheus from the eagle that was constantly eating his liver. You know, all very chill stuff, (you can imagine all this pissed of Hera and Eurystheus weren't very happy about this). So, due to Hera and Eurystheus being extra pissed off after all that they sent him to steal a belt from a bunch of super badass female warriors (the amazons). (Also some people think Theseus was here for all this) He ended up just talking to them and getting the belt though so Hera felt the need to intervene by shapeshifting into one of the amazons, (And we say holding grudges is a fatal flaw associated with hades?!) and was like, \"Hey, my husbands bastard child is here to kidnap the queen of the amazons we should totally kill him\", then.....\n\n*One very unnecessary massacre of some super badass warriors later (Thanks a lot Hera)*\n\nHe then returned to his cousin and got send on his 10th labor to collect the cattle of geryon, (why he wanted them idk). On the way there though he got pissed off about heat stroke and attempted to fight the sun and shot an arrow at it. This prompted (either Helios or Apollo take your pick) to come deal with the situation and was impressed by Heracles sheer audacity and gifted him a magic cup that he could ride in to make his journey easier, (Hear that kids? Shoot the sun and you'll get a magic cup out of it). So when he go to the island with the cows he fought a three bodied giant, a son of ares (I think) and a 2 headed dog. Then he shoved all the cows into his magic cup from the sun god but on the way back one got loose so Heracles had to fight some dude names Eryx to get the cow back. After that Hera, being the petty bitch she is somehow scared all the cows away with a fly, (I didn't know cows where scared of flies). So after Heracles rounded them all up he finally made it back to his cousin just so he could kill them all in honor of Hera.\n\nThen with his first 10 tasks complete he had to complete 2 extras because his cousins and asshole. So, he got sent to go collect a golden apple from the hesperides tree. So he went to capture some shapeshifting sea god to reveal the location of the tree to him then according to some versions of the myth he suspended a child of Gaia in the sky and hugged him to death (Also he almost got sacrificed in Egypt by some king). But Heracles didn't want to do this labor himself (somehow it still counted though??? I think his douchebag cousin was just getting lazy tbh) so he went a tricked the titan Atlas into collecting the apples for him while he held up the sky in Atlas's place. When Atlas came back with the apples and offered to take them back himself Heracles said he needed to adjust his outfit and convinced Atlas to take back the sky (the flipping idiot).\n\nAnd finally, for his 12th and final labor his cousin sent him to retrieve Cerberus from the underworld (Pretty blunt about trying to get him killed my dude) so Heracles traveled to the underworld and found 2 people with there asses glued to rocks for all eternity (pretty sure it was for trying to kidnap Persephone but I don't remember) and freed one of them before getting scared off by a mini earthquake and made his way to Hades to ask permission to take his dog, (Fun fact, Cerberus pretty much translate to Spot so Hades, god of the underworld named his dog spot <3). Hades agreed as long as Heracles returned him unharmed, (and people think Hades is a villain, smh) so Heracles took Cerberus to his cousin who finally announced he was redeemed of his sins and gave up trying to kill him. So, finally redeemed for the murder of his family he fought a river god and married a princess named Deinaeria and he was happy for a while. That is until a centaur Nesso's kidnapped his wife and tried to marry her, so Heracles shot him with an arrow and as he bled out he convinced Deinareria to take some of his blood and if Heracles was ever on faithful to her it would act as a love potion, (spoiler alert - it was poison). Then later Deinareria noticed Heracles was flirting with someone named Iole (Dude, your married you keep it in your pants unless it's with your wife please, you almost got murdered multiple times because your dad cheated after all). So, when she was doing laundry she rubbed the centaurs blood onto Heracles clothing, which inevitably poisoned him so what did he do? That's right, he set himself on fire. But Zeus saved him and offered him immortality (hera wasn't too happy about that) which he accepted. Then he married, Hebe the goddess of eternal youth and that's pretty much that for Heracles.\n\n- The End \n\nThe myth of Orpheus and Eurydice\n\nSo, Orpheus was a child of the muse Calliope ( my phone keeps wanting to call her cantaloupe) and Apollo (I think some versions say it was some king too but idk I remember him being a child of Apollo), and because his dad was Apollo and his mom was the muse of poetry my dudes was a pretty sweet musician (for my fellow pjo fans, basically charm speak but with a lyre). He lived in Thrace and basically impressed everyone with his music. He was so good at music that he ended up part of the argonauts with Jason on his journey for some sick new drip (I'll probably talk about him more in his own myth later). Also he chilled in Egypt and learned about Dionysus cult worship for a while (well that's just ironic...)\n\nOrpheus fell in love with Eurydice and married her but this dude at there wedding (the literal god of marriage Hymen, not to be confused with the goddess of marriage Hera...yeah not that bitch) was like, \"so yeah this happy marriage isn't gonna last very long my dudes\" and safe to say his was right. Euphoria was walking with her nymph friends in the forest and i guess no one taught her that rhyme \"red on black friend of Jack, black on yellow you're a dead fellow\" because boom, snake bite and she was dead.\n\nSo, Orpheus was obviously crushed by this loss and decided to go all emo and write super angsty music and stuff, but cause his music was magical and all that he started making everyone depressed so Apollo came to him and was like, \"dude you gotta stop making everyone sad, go return your wife from the underworld or something but please stop making everyone depressed and angsty with you\", so Orpheus traveled to the underworld to retrieve his wifey from the dead.\n\nHe went before Hades and Persephone (so this happened in winter or fall) and started playing his angsty emo music for them instead and it was so powerful it made everyone in the underworld sob, so Hades agreed to let Eurydice to travel back to the lane of the living with Orpheus but with the deal that Orpheus couldn't turn around to look at Eurydice until they were both out of the underground. Orpheus would have to lead Eurydice with his music but if Orpheus ever turned around to see Eurydice before they were in the mortal world she would be forced to return to the underworld.\n\nThey managed to make it all the way to the entrance when Orpheus feared he was being tricked by hades (hear that folks, Hades is a villain propaganda lost him his wife) and turned around only for his wife to be sent back to the underworld. After loosing his wife for a second time and returning to being angsty he decided to swear off relationships with woman and instead turned to pedophilia directed at young boys.....\n\nThen, when he was having an angsty concert for the forest creatures bashing all the gods a bunch of Dionysus cult followers showed and ripped him limb from limb for not worshipping Dionysus (again, the irony). In death he was finally reunited with his dearly beloved Eurydice (imagine him having to explain his angsty pedophilia faze...that would definitely be awkward af). And his lyre became a constellation at one point too. \n\nThe myth of Hades and Persephone\n\nSo, I'm sure many people think of this story and go \"Oh HaDeS iS a BaD gUy! He KiDnApPeD hIs wIfE!\"AND YEAH, HE DID KIDNAP HIS WIFE BUT JUST TAKE A SEAT AND CHILL PLEASE BECAUSE I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS HADES SLANDER!!! (Even if it's a bit deserved ;-;)\n\nAnyways, Hades, god of the dead (Yes, the dead. Not death. The god of death is Thanatos, there's a difference.), was one of the big three brothers who helped defeat the titans.\n\nHades ruled the underworld and one day, he saw a very pretty goddess, Demeter's daughter, Persephone (In some versions she's called Kore, which means maiden. Side note, in the version I was told as a kid, he fell in love with her because she was the only one who wasn't afraid of Cerberus, which is just so adorable to me <3), and our bro started simping for her.  So, he went to Zeus (Persephone's father mind you) and was like, \"I wanna marry her, but I have social anxiety and don't know how to talk to hot people so wtf do I do?!\" to which Zeus, after thinking long and hard (note my sarcasm) was like, \"Uh, just kidnap her....that normally works for me\" (Also, in some versions Zeus arranged there marriage in the first place)\n\nSo, when Persephone (Or Kore, take your pick) was out picking flowers, Hades rode out from the underworld on his chariot and kidnapped her after she wandered off on her own (versions may very). But Demeter noticed her absence and was (rightfully) concerned for her daughter and went to the sun god Helios (the version I know, it was Helios so we're going with that for now, if you want you can say it's apollo) and Helios was like, \"Oh her? Yeah, Hades kidnapped her-\" (Cue distressed screaming from demeter)\n\nUpon finding out her daughter was, you know, kidnapped she rightfully freaked out and Helios was like, \"Hey, Hades isn't the worst person to be stuck with, he's actually pretty cool, blah blah blah, misogyny is cool, blah blah-\" (Cue more angry Demeter noises)\n\n(SIDE NOTE, Misogyny is most diffidently NOT COOL BROS! Ancient Greece was not very good to women, and the stories and myths of the time reflect that as a whole, I try to keep things light hearted but some myths, such as Medusa, have heavy themes of this or these themes still slip through. Ancient Greece was pretty fucked up so just know I try my best but the stories are still gonna reflect the time period in some aspects)\n\n-Back to our scheduled programming-\n\nOnce Demeter had calmed down from her fit of rage (Justified rage to be fair), she decided her best course of action to fill the Persephone shaped hole in her heart was.....to dress up as an old lady named Doso and become a baby sitter for this kid, Demophoon (I imagine this kid has a fair helping of childhood trauma after this lol). But along with all the normally babysitter duties she also.... planned to make him immortal so she coated him in ambrosia, breathed on him and set him on her boobs and put him to bed in a fire at night to burn away his mortal spirit....(Someone's been hanging out with Hera a little to much lol). All without his parents knowing. But, one night when she put the baby to sleep in a fire (This kid and Leo Valdez can trauma bond over this lol) his mother walked in and rightfully...freaked out, interrupting the ritual and, in some versions, killing Demophoon. Though in others he survives his night in the fire, but dies later due to the weird half immortality thing he's got going on after this whole ordeal. (She also taught Demophoon's older brother to be a farmer after this and apparently my dude travels on a dragon-drawn chariot....so...)\n\nBut after the mothers freak out, Demeter gets upset and reveals herself to be a goddess and told Demophoon's parents, the only way she'd forgive them was if they built her a temple (I'd be so confused if I was the parents in this situation).  So, the parents built her a temple and Demeter chilled there instead of Olympus and became so depressed she forgot to make plants grow and caused this huge drought/famine.\n\nAnd the rest of the gods started noting and where like, \"So, what the fuck is up with Demeter and why are we not getting sacrifices from the mortals anymore??\"\n\nSo all the gods went to Demeter's little depression nest and tried to coax her back to Olympus or at the very least, get her to stop letting all the plants die, and they all failed. So Hermes decided to go knocking on Hades door to get some answer on Persephone and hopefully convince her to return to the mortal world so Demeter would stop being an angsty little bitch and killing all the mortals.\n\nPersephone agreed to return with Hermes but before she left she ate 6 pomegranate seeds (In some versions I think they say it was 12 but I remember it as 6), and when she returned Demeter was finally happy again and decided she wasn't going to slowly end humanity with a lack of plants. However, because she ate the pomegranate seeds she had to stay in the underworld but Demeter and Hades got into an argument which I imagine went a little something like this,\n\n\"If you eat food in the underworld you have to stay there!\"\n\n\"Oh really? Then how are you here?!\"\n\n*Cue awkward pause*\n\n\"I don't count, but she ate 6 pomegranate seeds so she has to stay in the underworld with me!\"\n\n\"Well, she only had 6 seeds! Not a whole pomegranate so surely she can stay with me instead!\"\n\n*Lots of godly screaming, meanwhile Persephone and Hermes are just watching*\n\nHermes - \"So you see that race last weekended? It was pretty cool\"\n\nPersephone - \"Ah, no I missed it....was sort of kidnapped by my husband remember?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, that sucks...\"\n\n\"Meh, he's got a dog though, I like dogs\"\n\nBut anyways, they decided to take the matter to Zeus (Why him I'm not sure, like I know he's the king of the gods and all but...I feel like it would have made more sense for Athena to handle this one but maybe that's just me) who eventually decided that because she only ate 6 seeds, she only had to spend 6 months in the underworld. But, Demeter swore that she wouldn't let plants grow without Persephone being with her.\n\nSo now, 6 months of the year Demeter gets seasonal depression and stops making plants grow while Persephone vibes with a dog, her husband and a bunch of dead dudes for 6 months.\n\n- The End \n\nThe myth of Pandora's box\n\nHey there! Remember what I said in the Hades and Persephone chapter about misogyny in ancient greece? Yeah, this might have a bit of that peaking through in parts so just, fair warning folks!\n\nSo, Pandora's box can basically be summed up as a myth explaining how people happened (least, according to the ancient greeks). Also, this and Hades and Persephone where the first greek myths I ever heard so I kinda have a soft spot for them lol.\n\nBut anyways, if we wanna start with how people happened (again, according to the ancient greeks) there were many trials and errors with creating people. When the tians where around, they created people which where actually not to bad or creepy (I will touch on the whole soulmate thing briefly here but I'll probably dedicate a chapter to it too if I'm up for it). But when Zeus took over (I'll go a chapter on the titan war at some point too) I guess he destroyed those people or something cause I can't find much about what happened to them (Then again, not entirely sure what I should be looking for in that regard so take this with a grain of salt).\n\nThe titan Prometheus (Some versions say he was a god I think? Idk, were just going with titan) could see the future, so before the whole titan war he and his brother, Epimetheus (he'll be important later), went into hiding so they didn't have to deal with it all. So when Zeus took over he created his own human race, though they sort of just stayed babies for a 100 years then died. So, he started over with a different batch of human which stayed babies for a lot less time that his first versions.\n\nBut, these humans where violent towards each other so Zeus refused to give them fire. But Prometheus gave them fire anyways, until Zeus found out he chained him to a rock and had an eagle eat his liver everyday for eternity until Heracles helped him out with it. But Zeus still wanted to punish people for having fire so he had Hephaestus create a woman named Pandora to be there punishment. (Again, misogyny is not cool folks!). The gods gifted her a dress, flowers for her hair, golden jewelry etc.\n\nAnd, this is the part where the myth gets kinda fuzzy, in the kids book I had Pandora was given her box and then later her daughter was the one to open it but I don't think that version is very authentic considering it was a Max and Ruby picture book for kids so while it was the version I grew up with, I don't think it's the most accurate to the original myths.\n\nBut in some versions on the myth that I've heard she was given her box (Which was actually a storage jar in the original myths, but got changed to box threw translation errors) as one of her gifts from the gods. Prometheus (Remember him? yeah, well he can still see the future) told his brother that Zeus was going to try and arrange a marriage between Epimetheus and Pandora and then Pandora was going to unleash all her plagues and bad stuff out of the jar to screw over the entirety of humanity and that he probably shouldn't do marry her. But Epimetheus married her anyways and just like Prometheus had said she opened her box/jar and released all the evil stuff into the world (Except for hope, which I'm pretty sure stayed in the jar).\n\nIn other versions, Zeus left the jar/box in the care of Epimetheus (I think anyways) and Pandora grew curious and opened the box accidently releasing all the evil shit into the world but quickly closed it upon realizing what she did, leaving hope trapped in the jar. (Funnily enough, this isn't the first time opening jars or urns have been said to releasing bad stuff in greek myth, there's also references to it in the Iliad).\n\nSo now the mortals had to deal with sickness and famines and stuff, so Zeus decided \"Fuck it\" and started making a flood to whip them all out (I swear, gods all throughout different mythology and religions always resort to 'when in doubt, drown humanity', like this shows up so many times through old religions and mythologies I swear. Like, who started that? Who was the first god/goddess to drown humanity??).\n\nBut anyways, Prometheus keeps providing exposition to people despite his lack of a liver, so he goes to his son Deucalion and tells him Zeus is having his \"when in doubt, drown humanity\" moment so he should probably act accordingly and unlike Epimetheus, Deucalion actually decided to act accordingly by shoving himself and his wife, Pyrrha into a box so they could just vibes through Zeus's rain of terror (Literal rain of terror in this case).\n\nSo after basically vibing through Zeus's apocalypse it was sort up to them to re-populate the earth but instead of doing it the natural way they took the easy and lest incent-y (Big shocker there considering it's Greek Mythology) way to do so and just tossed some rocks around which Zeus turned into people. And this was finally the human race that stuck and didn't get wiped out (I mean, if 2020 is anything to go by there's been attempts to do so but we're, somehow, still standing!).\n\n- The End ", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"52941766\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"liver consumption\", \"Victim\": \"Prometheus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"eagle\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"attempted drowning\", \"Victim\": \"mortals\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zeus\"}} ```"}
{"work_id": 48677368, "full_story": "I found myself becoming Menelaus.\nMy husband tossed into a useless war, and then further, into unfriendly homes, taken in by wretched men and Gods.\nBut never dead.\nSing to me, Sacker of Cities, about a vagabond.\nHe who was stolen by the sea, even as he trampled on the hearth of Troy, and his wife waited dutifully for his return.\nAlways faithful.\nAlways Penelope.\nOne flesh, one bone, one heart, do you remember that I never loved you?\nNo, I was you.\nRemember, roadless one, that the goddess of weaving is also my patron. I am also a liar.\n\n\nI was queen Dido, I alone governed my kingdom, and we had never been more prosperous. Even the slaves ate well, and it was all due to my leadership. \n\n\n\nIt was noonday when you arrived, Aeneas, and your eyes glowed bright black, ensnaring me in the web your dutiful mother wove. Could you have not taken me without help?\n\n\n\nI came to my senses after I died, of course, but you never did.You wanted me as your mistress even after I became a silent wraith. \n\n\n\nI take some perverse happiness in knowing that your city too, will surely fall.  \n\n\n\nI was raped. \n\n\n\nThere, I've said it, the cat is out of the bag, the girl is out of Sparta, whatever you thought I did, you were wrong. \n\n\n\nBut did you really think it would be anything else? Paris was pretty, but he wasn't mine. None of them were, because you can't truly love a woman like you love gold. \n\n\n\nThat's what nobody seems to understand. \n\n\n\nAnd what none of \n\nyou \n\nseem to understand, not even after I'm dead and rotting in my grave, my dear suitors, is that I never chose to be beautiful. Give that role to Clytemnestra.\n\n\n\nSo I gave Helen to Paris. Okay, I'm a Goddess. What did you expect?\n\n\n\n\nNo, \n\nI'm not every man's wish fulfillment wet dream given human form. Where on \n\nearth \n\ndid you get that idea? \n\n\n\nI'm the Goddess of sex, desire, and power. I stood over Ares with a sword on his chest when he propositioned me, and he knew I could leave him with a godly scar and it only excited him more. I stepped on his throat and he gagged and got hard underneath me. \n\n\n\nSo yes, I gave Helen to Paris. I'm a Goddess. What did you expect?\n\n\n\nCan't we talk about something other than the various men we fucked? \n\n\n\nNo? I didn't think so. Those were the only unique things about our pitiful lives. \n\n\n\nThere's nothing I desperately want to say about Jason- He was a hero, I was forced to love him, he sailed away, he was a bad man. It's the gods I hate. \n\n\n\nI never knew what lust was until they started meddling. Bodies disgusted me, I only wanted to tend to my herbs in peace. The Gods made my body desire Jason, but my mind revolted, even up until the day I died. \n\n\n\nStop making me a \n\nvictim. \n\nGod. \n\n\n\nHow many times do I have to say it to make it clear? He cried on the beach every night. I'm a god, and he was a mortal. Do the math. We women don't have to be the victims in every story, you know. Don't I get to follow my nature as a deity?\n\n\n\nDoes it make you uncomfortable that a woman could do that to a man instead of the other way around?\n\n\n\nMake me a villain- it's the role I deserve. But do it right. I'm not just evil, I'm also powerful. \n\n\n \n\n\nI bet you're wondering why I'm here. Or maybe you figured it out a long time ago, and you're simply laughing at my shame. \n\n\n\nWhen did you get your doubts? Was it Pentheus? Ariadne? The Maenads? Or was it just my own sad nature?\n\n\n\nI sometimes find myself becoming Aphrodite. Love, madness, beauty- it's all the same to me, it all leads to the same wild feast of tearing Orpheus into shreds. It's not in my nature to humiliate myself, but it's also not in my nature to be a man. \n\n\n\nNow, what would you like to drink? Bourbon? Wine? \n\n\n\nDear father, I hope you die.\n\n\n\nThe people here are kind, and I wish I thought about you less than I do, but even now, you control the whole of Rome, reaching into parts of Egypt. Not the parts I'm in, I hope. \n\n\n\nYour prodigal daughter, I would have gotten in the way of your godhood, bringing home both men and women with wild abandon. \n\n\n\nI like to think you wouldn't have done this to me if you weren't Deus Romae,  but you would've. If you didn't have Agrippa, you could've saved some of your love to give to me. \n\n\n \n\n\nI don't want to talk about it. Achilles and Agamemmnon, Chryses and the war and the plague. I was hidden inside a tent for most of it, anyway.\n\n\n\nDays were good, nights were hell, I danced and cooked and wept for my Trojan sisters that were jailed like me.\n\n\n\nI was beaten least out of all the girls. Achilles didn't like the look of bruises on me- my skin was too fair to hide the marks, and for all his faults, he wasn't a sadist. I was never an Athena or an Artemis. Just Hestia, a woman of the hearth. \n\n\n \n\n\nOkay, Okay! I know what I did wasn't \n\nmature. \n\nBut I was \n\nright. \n\nI don't regret the hill I chose to die under. \n\n\n\nI punched Creon before I died. I fought right up until the end, even when he lowered me into my grave I was still screaming, damning him with every bit of breath I had, using my blood to seal that curse. \n\n\n\nThere's nothing worse than a disrespecter of the dead, you know? Killing is one thing-  eternal torment is  another. \n\n\n\nI had a soft heart. If I hadn't died for Polyneices, I would have never slept again. \n\n\n\nOh Aphrodite, \n\n\n\nI slept in gardens of roses, crowns of lavender on my head, and there was barley underneath her fingernails. \n\n\n\nIs this the sorrow I must bear, Aphrodite? For I have been ensnared in a web of desire, and I see her lips, flushed and smiling, in my sleep. \n\n\n\nI am sick on daisies- \n\n\n\nWhy was I cursed, Aphrodite, to love a woman who has pledged herself to Artemis, the moon-faced goddess? \n\n\n\nHer skin reminds me of the sand, her eyes; the seashells, and when she speaks, the ocean roars. \n\n\n\nRelease me, Aphrodite! I am sick on her smile.\n\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\n\nI am not ashamed to be a woman of the hearth. After all, we cannot all be Aphrodites, Artemises, Athenas. Some of us have to tend to the hearth. \n\n\n\nDo I not belong in the list of women who have changed history? Am I not man enough? Am I too soft, peaceful, too willing to situate myself as a peacemaker rather than a fighter of the law? \n\n\n\nI have no man and no woman. I have no mother and no father. I am \n\nHestia, \n\nprotector of the hearth, patron of unsatisfied young women and lover of light. I am Hestia.\n\n\nOh my god guys I've been writing this play about sappho and legit every page takes me a full hour to write, if not longer, because I have to translate all of the sappho fragments I want to use in the play and I'm piecing it altogether like a puzzle and anyway I really hope my friend knows someone who would want to put it on as a play. It's not my best work but it's certainly my hardest work.\n\n\nSo little is said about me, I wonder if I exist outside of Briseis and my father. \n\n\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I was just another one of the slave girls, nothing special about me except that somebody cared enough to come after me, and a god cared about him enough to let me free. \n\n\n\nAnd isn't that the story of every woman in the war? \n\n\n\nWe were nothing, really. Just girls unlucky enough to be caught in the wrong place, and therefore, we were subject to the insatiable appetites of men no different than the men of Troy. \n\n\n\nFrankly, what men do is their own concern. I cared about Polyneices, of course I did, do you think I'm some kind of \n\nmonster? \n\nI just didn't think there was anything I could do without getting my own self killed. \n\n\n\nAntigone proved that. \n\n\n\nShe always cared too much for her family, even when they didn't care for her. \n\n\n\n I was a pragmatist. Get in, get out, try to have a little joy. Be ugly enough that nobody important  wants you, pretty enough to be married. In, out, done. \n\n\n\nAntigone always had grander aspirations, which I think is what killed her. \n\n\n\nOh come on, I know how you people see me now. I used to be beautiful. Cow eyed, they called me. Now, I suppose I'm just another pinched-face nanny. \n\n\n\nThey have an \n\nobsession, \n\ndown on earth. Either you're beautiful and free and young, or you're old and bitter and hateful. Tell me, was I any less vengeful than Aphrodite? Than Athena? \n\n\n\nI loved Zeus. I loved his body, his power, his wars. I also loved \n\nnot having to win that love every single goddamn day. \n\nAnd what do I get for that? I get called a prude and a shrew.  \n\n\n \n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\n\nIt was a pithos I opened, which is different from a box. A box means curiosity. It means lack of restraint. \n\n\n\nA \n\npithos \n\nmeans I was just trying to get some oil, which makes it worse, in a way. \n\n\n\nEvery religion has a hungry woman at the base of it. She who wants to eat more than she wants to wait. \n\n\n\nWhat is she waiting for? Her husband. He will provide food, provide glory, until the day he doesn't. If I was made to be a perfect slave to Zeus, why do I go to Hades because I was \n\nhungry?\n\n\n\nI wrote \"every religion has a hungry woman at the base of it\" and now I'm applying for a 1200 dollar research grant to talk about hunger and the feminine in greek mythos. I think I've really got something here. I expressed to my professor that I feel like it's not original and he said \"people have been studying this for 3000 years. You signed up to not be original.\" So. I hope I get the money. I want a new computer.\n\n\nWhat was I supposed to do? The last thing my husband did ere he set sail for Illium was to kill my child. He didn't kiss me goodbye, he didn't give his sons a parting word, no. He killed my daughter. \n\n\n\nHow is my daughter worth any less than Helen? They killed her for \n\nHelen, \n\nmy own sister, who would have died easily for my daughter. Come to think of it, she would have died for less, but that's besides the point. \n\n\n\nHe killed my youngest daughter, that's a crime I can't forgive.  He murdered my Iphegenia in cold blood. \n\n\n \n\n\nHere's a secret: I'm not a protector of girls. Oh sure, I'm wild and I'm woman\n\n, \n\nbut I was made by a man who told stories to a man who survived by the history of men and was placed into academia by men and for men, to be talked about and remade and written about by men. \n\n\n\nSo I'm the protector of virgins, not of women. \n\n\n\nI care for the clean and the pure, for the young and the proper, for the women that are women that are hunters that are temple-worthy soft and beautiful. \n\n\n\nThe others go to Bacchus. \n\n\n \n\n\nI begged you not to leave, Hector, I begged it of you. But no. You knew better, so you abandoned us in the castle, leaving me to nurse my son in his last hours alone, with no comfort and no protection as the wily man found me. I became a slave, Hector, the person you could not bear to see me become. I bore children for Greek men, your own son dead underneath the rubble of Troy, and for what? Your pride? You could have given Helen back yourself under cover of night if you really wanted me to live. \n\n\n \n\n\nHe left me on an island, and two days later, a wine god wants to make me his wife. I won't say anything unflattering about Bacchus- I wouldn't dare- But the men in my life have never once been a blessing. \n\n\n\nDid you know that when I was little, I wanted to become a priestess? My father forbade it, because then he wouldn't have a girl to use as a pretty little pawn in his political games. \n\n\n\nMaybe that's why I wanted Theseus's hand in marriage. To spite my family. Maybe I just wanted to leave that god damned island. \n\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\n\nI might be the only one of these women who's gotten myself through life unscathed. \n\n\n\nUnscathed, of course, being a relative term. \n\n\n\nHere's the thing: I was mostly normal, and for all the women that Odysseus exchanged words with, \n\nmostly \n\nnormal was good. It meant that I was half a human, and therefore I might not be wrapped up in the way of the gods. Making Odysseus walk behind me was the best choice I ever made in my sad, sorry life, and it might have been one of the only ones too. \n\n\n\nOh well. Count my blessings, I will. \n\n\n \n\nMy welsh teacher is going to teach me how to press grapes this weekend and thats somehow not the weirdest thing I'm dealing with\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\n\nThere is so little of me left, and what I have is saturated with pain. I wish I had written more. I wish I had written better. I wish what I had written had not been laced with honey-sweet sorrow, so thick and cloying that it melted away the better part of me. Grieving becoming my only bedfellow, and me, becoming more and more a part of the tenth muse- unwilling or unable to pull away from her. What could I have become, I wonder, if the loving part of me had survived? What kind of love could I give?\n\n\n \n\nSo the thing about erinna is that she's known for her sad poetry, right? Specifically about her lover, baucis. But we only have one bit of a bigger poem she wrong and three epigrams- everything else she wrote is lost. And it makes me think: yes, she wrote sad poetry but there must have been some glimmer of hope, had more of her writing survived. She must have written something good, and the amount of poetry that we lose to time is a tragedy in and of itself.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\n\nI am a warrior with a sword, I have bested Ares in battle more times than I can count, I am Pallas Athena, the warrior maiden of wisdom, and the keeper of crafts from the lowest slave to the highest nobleman. \n\n\n\nI am well renowned for having no mercy, I am tied to Odysseus in a way that I cannot escape, I loved his consort more. \n\n\n\nIt's a strange thing, to be a god and a servant at the same time. Strange, that my life still depends on wit and will, even now. Should not the world be my domain? \n\n\nAthena is so interesting. She's a woman. She has no mother. She is a man in all the ways that it matters. She patronizes weaving. She patronizes war. She is the odysseus of the gods- who is another man-woman figure.\n\n\nI told him not to go. He asked my advice, and I told him that going to see the man who killed my son would be stupid. But I was the stupid one, thinking that he would actually listen to me. \n\n\n\nHe was killed on the altar, right before I was killed just the same way, begging for mercy from the son of the man whose hands my husband kissed on the beach. Oh, what a tangled web we weave. \n\n\n\nLike it could have been better- Troy was going to fall, whatever friends my husband made across no man's land. \n\n\n\n\nWhat was there to complain of, except that she had been loved? \n\n\n\n\nThere was a lot to complain of. The horrible lot that I was dealt, for one, and the way that my husband wouldn't seem to give up, let me drink from the Lethe in peace. It was love, but it was that kind of destructive love that keeps your soul on earth far longer than necessary. The kind of love that kept Achilles from burying Patroclus until Hector was dead. I'm not angry, not exactly. I'm disappointed, and I'm sad, and I wish I had never met Orpheus.\n\n\n\nI took on the role of Lesbia, of Cynthia, of Delia, I am nothing but a Gorgo to history anymore. A lament of poetry, remembered through my lover. Perhaps I should have done more. \n\n\n\nI doubt that. \n\n\n\nWhat else could I have done? I exchanged kisses with Erinna, she wrote about our childhood, running through the waves and splashing on the shore, and everything we have lost- death ruins it all, she said. \n\n\n\nDid she mean to remember me through centuries of reinterpretation and language? Was I the lover she looked for in the smoke? Tell them- I am Baucis. \n\n\n\nMy son was stupid. But you already knew that. \n\n\n\nI was given to Peleus as a war prize. But you already knew that, too. Here's something you don't know: I hated Achilles. \n\n\n\nI loved him too, but I hated the parts of him that reminded me of Peleus, I hated his smile and his god-damned honor, I hated him, and I loved him with all the force of a mother unwilling to give up her son. \n\n\n\nMaybe I wish I had a daughter. \n\n\n\nMaybe that was why I tried to make him into one on Skyros, though it never worked. \n\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\n\nI'm still out here, feeding pigs to men and making men into pigs, and I'm not sorry. \n\n\n\nI know the ending of my story. I marry Telemachus, and who knows what happens after that? I don't matter beyond the family of Odysseus. \n\n\n\nKiss me and kill me, sail away- he wasn't a kind man, not in the slightest, which was unsurprising after all he went through. I was one of those trials, and I'm not sorry about that, either. Am I evil for fulfilling the purpose I was built for? \n\n\n\nThe most terrifying woman is a witch with a mouth. \n\n\nStill waiting to see if I got that research grant to study women's mouths in greek literature.... I'm gonna check right after i post this\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\n\n I spoke the greek of the home, of the women who could not leave, of the trapped. But you, Pindar, you spoke the greek of the city-states and the streets. I worshiped the women and I was quiet, but I am content with that, though you are remembered better. Did you ever think to see echoes of us in our later iterations? \n\n\n\nI have told stories from the coast of Mytilene to the shores of New York city. I have lived in homes abandoned and the fragrant crowns of Sappho have pillowed my fall.  And what has that made me?\n\n\n \n\nIf you haven't read corinna go do so. She's so good.\n\n\nWhat is a Mark Antony to a powerful woman? \n\n\n\nMore power, of course. He sips at my pearls and wine, gets drunk on sex and power, all the while, Octavius takes the senate for his own. \n\n\n\nYou would think that the way I used both Julius and his adoptive son would have made me a more powerful figure in Roman history, but I just became the exotic slut. \n\n\n\nWe humans have always been the same, I suppose. \n\n\n\nWhat am I to do? What role am I meant to play? And don't you dare tell me to be a woman again. \n\n\n\nWomen marry monsters. It's what we do. \n\n\n\nNot by choice, mind you, and certainly not of our own volition. But men are the monsters that control our lives, and we bear their children and weave their clothes and send them off to war and rejoice when they die and then go on living with a strange sort of melancholy in our hearts.\n\n\n\nWho can blame me for wanting to see the monster I married? To know if I married a monster? \n\n\n\nWomen marry monsters. It's what we do. I thought that I was smarter, but it was never  my choice. \n\n\n\nI'll tear your flesh from your body, eat it raw and whole, soak you in unwatered wine and when you are tender and supple underneath my tongue, I will rip you to pieces and laugh. \n\n\n\nI am not beholden to a man. There is no system that I serve. I am wild and free and like a puppet on a string, I must be an anti-woman. \n\n\n\nYou see, I am not a girl, not exactly. I am the image of one, the scarecrow of a maiden. In all the ways that it matters, I am quite clearly \n\nnot \n\na woman. \n\n\n \n\n\nI'm actually rather proud of my son. Angry, yes, but proud. He grew into the man that I raised him to be. \n\n\n\nThat was, perhaps, an oversight on my part. \n\n\n\nIf you raise a monster you get a monster, if I raised a thief I got myself a thief, since I raised a murderer, he killed me and kept the secret badly.  \n\n\n\nI deserved it. We always do. But Nero grew into a woman, and that disappointed me, and I wonder if that says more about me or about him, that I will not let him be what I am. \n", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"48677368\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"tearing to pieces\", \"Victim\": \"Orpheus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Maenads\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"killed\", \"Victim\": \"speaker's son\", \"Perpetrator\": \"speaker's son\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"killed\", \"Victim\": \"speaker\", \"Perpetrator\": \"speaker's son\"}} ```"}
{"work_id": 44140441, "full_story": "I stopped my twin as soon as he set foot on the balcony. \"No.\"\n\nApollo was flustered and more than a little angry. This is the first time I have refused him. I could never refuse my brother, but in this matter, what he wanted to do, I had to say no.\n\n\nHelp me. I need to know what Cinthus's fate is. Please help me.\n\n\n\n I will not help you with this. In fact, I need you to promise that you will never seek out knowledge of his destiny. \n\n\nMy brother grew puce.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\n What would you do if you had that knowledge, hmm? Hunt down all those who wish to hurt him? Spend every moment fretting over gathering shadows and unseen enemies? Waste what precious time you have with him? \n\n\n\nHe could be gone tomorrow by dawn! This very hour! I need to know!\n\n\nNo! I push him back and use my powers to stop him from leaving. It really hurt, but I had to do it. I will not let you do it. Phoebus!\n\nHe stopped, his breath coming out all ragged and harsh. I have never seen my brother behave like this where anyone else was concerned. That look in his eyes, that anguish, that desperation, it was as if Hyacinthus was-\n\nYour other half? My hands go to my mouth. Is he your soul's other half?\n\nThe way he looked at me. How is this even possible? We were Gods. A soul's other half should not exist for us, but this was a matter for another time. Right now, I had to stop him from doing something reckless and foolish.\n\n\n Apollo, you must not go to the Fates. They have not forgotten that stunt you pulled with Hermes. Remember? When the two of you got them drunk so that you could meddle with Admetus' fate? The crones do not forget such acts; they will only plague you with riddles and half-truths, leading you by the nose, just to get back at you. \n\n\nThat got to him, I think. Sensing the futility of his cause, my brother collapsed onto a stool and buried his hands in his hair.\n\n\nI am afraid, sister. I have this feeling in me that this is not going to last much longer.\n\n\n\n\nCan you not see it?\n\n\n\nI crouch next to him and try to peer into his thoughts. Anything connected to Cinthus and his future faded abruptly into nothingness. Someone very powerful was preventing us from seeing. The Fates, no doubt, already getting back at my brother for what he did. My throat tightened. I peered into the bedroom, and my eyes actually stung. Cinthus was not going to be with us for long.\n\nApollo shook his head. Every time I get close, it feels like a great wall drops in front of me to stop me from seeing beyond. He looked at me, his eyes filled with golden tears. What do I do? Should I tell him?\n\nNo. Cinthus will always be looking over his shoulder. Let him enjoy the most of what little time he has left. My brother nodded in agreement. As for what you could do? Love him. I said. Maybe he truly has only one hour left on this earth, and how do you want to spend that hour? Fretting over every shadow or making the most of every last second with him?\n\nMy brother looked like he had decided. I will not seek out the Fates. It is all right, sister, you can go now.\n\nFirst things first. But only after you swear an eternal vow to not interfere with his fate.\n\n\nSister...\n\n\nSwear it! I held onto his arm and refused to let go. Swear that you will not meddle!\n\nMy brother sighed, his shoulders slouched in defeat. Help me with the words then.\n\nI did it carefully, leaving nothing to chance. Apollo winced as he repeated every word I said, for there were no weaknesses for him to find, no crack to wriggle through. Finally, we were done, and a silvery star gleamed in the centre of his chest. Go. I heard sheets rustling, a body stirring, lips forming my brother's name. He searches for you.\n\n\nIs Hyacinthus truly not long for this world?\n\n\nHermes was here, and he, too, was upset. Over the past few months, we had both come to see Hyacinthus as a brother of sorts, our newest comrade. The knowledge that he would not be with us for much longer was too much for even me to bear. Yes. I put an arm around my half-brother. But do not say a word. Let them enjoy what little time they have left together.\n\nFor once, Hermes sniffed and made a vow not to gossip.\n\nFinally, spring surrendered to summer. My birthday dawned bright, crisp, and hot. Father threw a feast after we had made the necessary sacrifices for the Gods.\n\nMany came up to wish me, with just as many asking when I hoped to marry, asking if I would like to be introduced to the noble maidens they knew. I politely refused, and when they turned to my father, he simply said, if he's not interested, then he's not interested. Many were confused by this, but the others, older and much wiser, understood without having to be told further. They bobbed their heads and went back to eating and drinking.\n\nThe mid-morning feast had been splendid, as was the private dinner mother had planned for when the twins and Hermes dropped by.\n\nHermes was very well behaved, although that could have been due to the vow he swore, promising not to make off with anything that belonged to us. He stretched out by the fire while I opened my presents.\n\nFirst, there was a beautiful bow, with gold inlay that gleamed in the light. This was from Artemis, and the quiver was filled with sleek arrows. They all bore the mark of Hephaestus, and I would neither miss nor run out of arrows. Next was a box of rare coins from Hermes, from countries as far off as Taprobane and even further than that, from a land famous for its silk.\n\n\"My lord?\" I pointed to the crest on the box. It had been taken from someone else. Hermes' reddened cheeks were proof of it. I grinned and accepted it all the same. Hermes was who he was. Nothing was going to change that.\n\nThen there were the traditional gifts from my parents, given to all Spartan men on their twenty-first birthday. A traditional Spartan helmet with a horsehair plume that had been stiffened and dyed a deep rich red, a shield and spear. I would now carry these if we went to war again. Poly gave me a bracelet she made herself, then made herself content talking to Artemis.\n\nWhen he and I were alone, Apollo gave me the most beautiful aulos I had ever seen, something he had fashioned with his own hands. We then lay down on the balcony of my room, under the stars, with him pointing out those that were made immortal by the Gods.\n\n\"Herakles,\" he pointed to a constellation. \"Athena herself brought him to Olympus. He now guards the gates to our realm.\"\n\nAnd Apollo was the one that set the twelve labours on him, so he could atone for murdering his family. \"And that?\"\n\n\"Kheiron,\" the centaur of legend. \"Father brought him to Olympus to teach his growing brood.\"\n\n\"He died just after the Trojan war, didn't he?\" I rested my head on his chest, my heartbeat slowing down with every breath he took. \"I heard he taught Herakles and Achilles.\"\n\nApollo flinched. \"My love? Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"It is the reminder of Achilles. I pushed Patroclus off the wall.\" Apollo sighed. \"Patroclus tried to scale the walls of Troy. If he had, it would have roused the Argives into pushing through.\"\n\nApollo looked ashen from what he had done. \"I pushed him off the wall, stripped his armour off of him. Made it easy for Hector to kill him. It was cowardly, I see it now. Patroclus fought bravely, and with honour. He deserved a better death.\"\n\nI just listened. The Gods had a direct role in the war, and to hear something resembling regret from one of them...\n\"I sided with the Trojans. Father's orders. He favoured the Trojans and wanted to support them. I was given clear orders. And I followed them. And Troy still fell.\" Apollo sighed and raised my hands to his lips. \"All of that grief because Paris could not keep his hands off Helen. She is there too,\" he pointed to the sky. \"With Menelaus.\"\n\nAccording to legend, it was she who went with Paris willingly. Artemis said it was actually Paris who abducted a very unwilling Helen.\n\n\"Was she happy after that? Helen?\"\n\n\"Traumatized would be a better word.\" Apollo ran his hand over my chest, his breath hitching when mine went over his thigh. \"And she cursed Paris till the day she died.\"\n\nHe carried me to bed after that, our hands and lips going over the bumps and lines that had become so dear to us. It was well past midday when he finally left.\n\nThe memory came back again, this time sharper and clearer than before.\n\nIt was in Troy, with the Argives being slaughtered after Father dropped the scales to honour a debt he owed Thetis. The smell of steel, flesh, and burning wood filled my lungs, and that voice in the darkness grew clearer now. This time I could see fired gold hair whipping in the wind, and sea green eyes spitting fire and malice at me.\n\n\n\n\"But I swear, here and now, a time will come when all your hopes will dash to the ground, and your joy will become like ash in your mouth. A time when your dreams will burn to cinders and all that you have longed for will come to nought. When that day comes, I will drink to your suffering.\"\n\n\nI opened my eyes with a start. I never bothered with the ravings of angry mortals, but this, this settled in my heart like a flame.\n\n\n\nA time will come when all your hopes will dash to the ground, and your joy will become like ash in your mouth.\n\n\nHyacinthus. My joy, now sleeping safely in my arms. What will I do when I lose him?\n\nI remembered my sister's words and fought back the feeling of gloom growing in my heart. Whatever amount of time I had with him, I would make the most of it.\n\nThree days later, I went to the marketplace to meet some friends. When the west wind picked up and dust whirled around us like angry bees, I was joking with them, listening to their stories, their loves and losses, and how we planned on competing for the games. I picked up the scent of something strange.\n\n\"Prince of Sparta.\"\n\nThe voice was ugly, and the words came out in hisses, like rough winds whipping around jagged mountain peaks. It had to come from a God, and only one God had ties with the west wind. My friends made their excuses and left.\n\n\"My Lord Zephyrus,\" I said, bowing as deeply as I could. \"Would you care for some refreshment? some libation? Perhaps I could take you to the palace, so you could rest?\"\n\n\"None of that.\" His voice was rather like the wind of a hurricane. \"I wish for your company.\"\n\nThe tone of his voice set my teeth on edge and made the hairs on the back of my neck stand.\n\n\"How may I be of service to you, my lord?\"\n\nHe seemed to leer at me, and I did not like it one bit. I sent a quick prayer to the twins, hoping one of them would hear.\n\nZephyrus cocked his head to the side and said, \"You will serve me. Or do you need plainer words than that?\"\n\nI understood fully. Some Gods were like this, never asking, only demanding, or simply taking.\n\n\"You flatter me with your attention,\" I put on my best simpering voice, to soften the blow to his ego. \"Truly.\"\n\n\"B-but?\" Zephyrus said in a huff.\n\nHe would not appreciate it if I refused him, but I must. I could not bear the thought of being with anyone other than Apollo.\n\n\"I must decline. I am already promised to another, and will not betray them.\"\n\n\"I know who it is. You reek of him, that Olympian prig,\" he spat in disgust. \"Come with me, young man. I will show you a much better time than him.\"\"My answer is no.\" I stood up to him, my spine straight. \"I belong to Apollo and no other. Kindly leave me, my lord, and trouble me no further.\"\n\nZephyrus advanced on me, the wind whipping at his hair in a rage. I guess no one had told him no before.\n\n\"You dare refuse me, you insignificant worm?\"\n\nI backed away from him and realised the streets were now empty. Everyone had gone for their afternoon rest, and I was alone. Damn.\n\n\"You will give yourself to me, and I will not hear a word against it!\"\n\nMy palm, the one that was cut when Apollo's vow to me was sealed, burned. \"No!\" I backed away from him some more, only to find myself being pushed back into an abandoned alley, one that had a dead end. When a wall hit my back, I winced. There was no escape now. I close my eyes and await the inevitable.Zephyrus was close, his breath on my cheeks, his hand pulling on my arm, and then--\n\nHe quickly let go, and the scent of honey and warm summer morning filled my lungs. \"He said no, you primitive slug.\"\n\nThere was a growl, a loud thud, a struggle of some sort. I opened my eyes to find Zephyrus pinned to a wall and Apollo in front of him, his arm on his throat. Artemis had her back to me, an arrow already nocked to her bow. Her dogs were on either side of her, snarling and snapping. The Titan squirmed, but Apollo had him in a firm grip.\n\n\"Leave us, Titan. Leave us and never come back to this place.\"\n\n\"Or what?\" Zephyrus had not been bested by an Olympian and looked humiliated. \"What will you do? Sing to me?\"\n\n\"No singing for the likes of you.\" Apollo snarled. \"I will simply beat you to a bloody pulp, and my sister will geld you and feed your parts to her dogs. What say you, sister? Will you be up for the challenge?\"\n\n\"I look forward to it,\" Artemis said with a vicious smile.\n\n\"There, you see? My sister is looking forward to it. How will you feel pleasure again?\" Apollo's eyes narrowed to slits when Zephyrus struggled again. \"How will you face your fellow Titans again?\"\n\nThat got to him, the shame of being emasculated by a bastard child of Zeus. Zephyrus tried to speak, to reason and compromise perhaps, but Apollo cut him off.\n\n\"Be gone West Wind. Never bother us again.\"\n\nTime seemed to stand still. Titan and Olympian glared at each other like two rival lions circling a kill until, finally, Zephyrus growled again before yielding and vanishing.I tried to breathe, to speak, but the world grew dizzy. I was nearly assaulted by a God and he would have gotten away if the twins had not turned up when they did. It was too much. It was all too much. My knees buckled.\n\n\"Cinthus!\"\n\n\"I have him,\" Apollo murmured, and lifted me.\n\nEverything shimmered, and I found myself in my bedroom. I was stripped of my clothes, washed, and then taken to bed. There was humming, and the pain in my hand disappeared. Soft pillows greeted me, and strong arms went around me.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I whispered and buried my face in his chest. The warmth of his skin soothed me, the sweet scent of honey lulling me to sleep.\n\n\"Anything for you,\" He whispered back. \"Rest, my love, you need it.\"\n\nWe heard neither hide nor hair of Zephyrus after that. I heard no gossip from other Gods, and neither had Hermes. Had Zephyrus backed off for good?\n\nI pushed him and the growing feeling of dread out of my mind and focused on Hyacinthus instead. He had grown quiet and withdrawn, always fearful if I was not around. I tried to be with him as much as I could, to make him feel safe. I asked if he wanted to tell his parents, but he refused. He said it would only endanger everyone if his father took it into his head to challenge Zephyrus, and challenge Zephyrus he would if he knew what happened to his son. I respected his wish and tried to come up with as many distractions as I could for him.\n\nToday I took Hyacinthus to an old orchard away from the city--one that had been abandoned and allowed to grow wild.\n\n\"Don't worry, my love,\" I brushed back his hair as we sat beneath an ageing olive tree. \"You are safe now.\"\n\n\"Gods do not take kindly to such rejections,\" Hyacinthus rested his head under my chin and sighed. \"Especially the likes of him.\"\n\nThere was that feeling of dread again.\n\n\"Ignore him,\" I leaned in for a kiss, my smile growing at the need in his eyes. \"Later.\"\n\nHe blushed and reached into the pack I had brought with me.\n\n\"Discus?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" I helped him up. \"You could do with the practise before the games.\"\n\n\"First one to throw the fastest wins?\"\n\nI picked one out for myself and grinned.\n\n\"Deal.\"\n\nNothing seemed untoward as the morning progressed. We took turns teasing each other, throwing the discus as far as we could. I taught Hyacinthus a few pointers, helped him improve his throw. I came back to my pack for another discus after having shattered my first one by accident.\n\nLook!\" Hyacinthus called out to me. \"Look at how far mine is going!\"\n\nI grinned, ready to indulge him. Something then changed. I felt like we were being watched by jealous eyes, angry eyes. The wind felt foul, unnatural, like something else was in command of it.\n\n\nIf I cannot have him, then no one can!\n\n\nZephyrus. I dropped the pack just as the wind changed direction again, and then--\n\n \n\nBone shattered.\n\nThe smell of blood filled the air.\n\nA body collapsed.\n\nI got to Hyacinthus before he hit the ground. I tried to heal him, to revive him, but his life-force continued to spill out of him. I heard cackling. The Fates. This was Hyacinthus' final destiny.\n\nThere was a wail, loud and unnatural, shattering the peace of the grove. It was mine. There were pleadings and screams, and tears, hot and stinging, like a million tiny blades. They too, were mine.\n\n\"Hyacinthus,\" I whispered, between ragged sobs. \"My heart. Do not leave me.\"\n\nHyacinthus' eyes flickered open, briefly, and they already glazed over.\n\n\"A-Apollo...\" He fought for each breath. \"I-I -.\"\n\nHe fought hard, but he was already losing. Death had him in its grip.\n\nI barely have time for a final farewell.\n\n\"Do not speak. Just listen.\" I kissed his hands repeatedly. \"I am grateful to you. Every moment with you has been a blessing, and I would not have it any other way. I love you. I will always love you and no one else. That was my vow to you.\"\n\nHe smiled. His hand, weak and trembling, tried to reach up to me, and then, he was gone.\n\nHyacinthus. My joy. The light of my life.\n\nAnd whose passing has plunged my world into bitter darkness.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"44140441\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"shattering\", \"Victim\": \"Hyacinthus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zephyrus\"} } ```"}

And a spear with blood on the top of it with a man descending in the river Styx's carved into it\n\nthe son of hades was unknown to the Olympians quiet being able to not be seen and he was okay with that. All his god hood entailed was watching the others bicker which got boring very quickly going back home take of the souls for the rest of the day talk a bit to the usually sleeping Hypnos and if he got lucky Thanatos. Hypnos barley keeping track about what zagreus was saying and just nodding and saying okay. His eyes were under a blindfold and to this day no one has seen him without it His hair was messy and hold together by a hair tie with pale short of graying skin and wearing something that you can sleep in. Thanatos was quite different who wore a hood on top chiton had grey hair and back eyes with white pupils his eyes were long and pointy and in the right light you would swear you saw black wing in him. Unlike his brother he would listen care fully on what zag said and would politely exit out of the conversation when he needed to leaving zag alone and just continuing on with his job then retreat back to his family talk to them then relax on his bed then it's day again.\n\nHis relationship with his parents was easy going\n\nThe mother of his named Persephone was kind to him always making sure he was okay and what not, make him something quick to eat and bid him a goodnight. She had a lighter blond hair with the best way to describe them zircon like hazel eyes and a light pink in her face. She wore a dress in black covered in gemstones and flowers like the ones on him and the singular on her head which was a gift by hades given the day she first got to see Demeter, her mom again, zag actually had never really met or talked to Demeter because he just didn't want to.\n\nthen their is his father hades.\n\nhe carried deeply for zagreus even if he didn't always like to show it he carried for the kid and he always has and always with. Hades had curly white hair and s little bit of wrinkles in you were to look closely he keep his Helmet near him all the time and some pieces of his old amor on him when he was in the titan war all those years ago.\n\nevery now and then he would check up on zag and make sure he was doing well zag always told him he was alright and hades would to him fully what happen during the day. Zag always liked these times where he could just let it all out and talk fully with someone who did wanna listen it made him feel okay okay okay  each day was okay nothing interesting nothing special just okay that would change really fast and he could handle this change.  December 24 year long forgotten Zagreus got to curious and drowned also remember as a day hades and Persephone will never forget\n\nZagreus started the day like any other dress himself up one last time in a tuxedo like uniform. Fitting for a funeral. He had not slept good so he took a quick trip through the underworld. This day he was able to talk to Thanatos and Hypnos\n\n\"good morning everyone\" Zag said Politely\n\n\"Wait it's morning already damn, Also good morning prince Zagreus\" Hypnos spurred out\n\n\"by the gods he's hopeless, anyways. Morning zag say I have never in my many years of living seen you wear a tux why the change\" Thanatos asked zag. Zagreus simply said that he had a weird feeling to just wear it Thanatos asked nothing more.  Until zagreus started walking towards a different area of the underworld\n\n\"Zag where are you going?\"\n\n\"somewhere, somewhere.\"\n\nThanatos had the feeling that something was wrong and after awaking his brother both of them followed zagreus. That was not gonna be the only thing strange about this day. \n\nWhen walking they saw a hecatoncheire walk past them destroying stuff in the process. Zag stopped walking and called out to him\n\n\"you there\" zagreus \"shouted what are you doing out of your post. You could put us all in danger because of the titans\"\n\n\"forgive me, young prince\" the hechatoncheire cried out.\n\n\"so thirsty... so hungry\" \n\nZagreus was confused as he thought they didn't eat the guy ran off leading to Thanatos and Hypnos to nearly get caught hiding under a rock that they were sure the hechatoncheire broke\n\nZag was right now to tired to deal with him so he continues his walk but keeping his guard up \n\nat this point Thanatos had message hades to come to his location and hades agree to, a surprise to them as he had always seen hades as the type to say no. Later during the walk of zagreus he noticed a crack mirror and started to look at it thinking the hechatoncheire guy must have cracked it. Just them he heard something turned around yet saw nothing just then he felt someone hit him throwing him into the ground. He quickly got back to his feet and got to a safer area. That is when he realized what he was looking at a titan, he wasn't sure which one though. But in that one moment zag thought to do only one thing...\n\n \n\nSurvive \n\nhe lunged himself at the titan pulling out his spear and hitting it with it. Even more titans appeared all wanting to kill.He cut, He hit, He dodged, he injured. All it took to survive. He transformed himself into multiple animals such as a snake lion and more. With one good hit he was able to cut the arm of a titan it's yells filling the area. He broke another ones leg, ripped a titans eye out and more. He threw himself into the air and just as he was gonna throw a finishing strike to one of them he heard a cry so loud he lost balanced and feel about 50 or more feet to the ground badly injured. He looked and saw Hypnos and Thanatos in shocked just starting at him and not being able to help. He cried and cried for help and got nothing in return as the titans pinned him down and grabbed his very own spear just for it to plunged into him by the titans blood pouring out of it. He tried to keep it together but simply just screamed for anyone. He thought of all the stuff he didn't get to do but was cut of when he felt someone tear his leg off he screamed. Screamed so loud you swear you could hear it from Olympus he heard people, probably Hypnos and Thanatos crying and begging the titans to let him go. But they didn't listen to them. He heard crackling beneath him and he realized the titans started a fire to burn him alive. He felt his very own skin tearing away his muscles, blood, and organs. He yelled screamed and cried but they didn't care. They ripped him apart first the legs then the arms then they went to his head\n\n \n\nthe last thing Zagreus, the prince of the underworld saw was his mother's teary eyes and his own heart being ripped out of him\n\n \n\n...\n\n \n\n...\n\n \n\n...\n\n \n\n...\n\n                                                               \"Welcome to the world little one\"\n\nDionysus, right after a tragedy to be born\n\n   A room up in Olympus that the king of the gods Zeus and his wife Hera relaxed after a long, loud, busy day That same room that was usually a quiet place was filled with the crying from the newest and now youngest  daughter of Zeus\n\n\n\"cmon little one, open your eyes\"\n\nAfter a while the crying was able to leave the room and the baby finally opened her eyes. The first thing she saw was her fathers long, cloud like beard and next his blue as sky eyes, then the giant smile on his face. She simply giggled and smile. He gently placed her on his bed while he looked around his room looking for something to cover her body with. After a while he was able to find a tiny blanket for her. Just before he wrapped the cloth around her he examined her features one last time.\n\nShe had beautiful brown eyes that reminded him of her late mother Semele. Who asked him to show his godly figure but the moment he did she died and turned to ash. With his daughter, the one he is looking at. Surviving. While still sadden of what happened he simply put the thought to the back of his head. The child is innocent zeus remember and went back to examining her. In his prime Zeus was said to how Lovley brown hair and it seemed like the baby inherited the color of it. Her skin was a light caramel color with rosy lips and cheeks, she was so much smaller than any of his children, mainly because she was born from a mortal.\n\nZeus wrapped her in the blue blanket cover her head so that mostly the rest of the gods would not see her, except one.\n\n\"Hermes!\"\n\nIn about 2 seconds Hermes appeared in front of him. He had short curly hair with a ponytail that was light brown with one neon yellow eye and the other blue. He wore a helmet with four wings with 2 on each side he had light skin and he had freckles with a bandage on his cheek he wore his normal wing sandals and long black shorts with w white shirt with a backpack to hold any mail he had.\n\n\"Gooood afternoon sir why did care to see me\" Hermes said with his cheerful voice\n\nZeus looked back at the girl in the blanket and handed it to Hermes\n\n\"go to earth and when you are safe open the blanket. Also make sure my wife doesn't see you\" Zeus told Hermes\n\n\"yes sir\" Hermes said and left\n\nas he flew he looked around to make sure no one saw him after flying for 8 seconds he found a abandoned house in Thebes. It was a 3 room house and after finding the bed he laid the blanket on top of it. It would be alright if he left it for 10 seconds to find and talk to Apollo, Right? \n\nHe zipped back to Olympus and after a while found Apollo playing music with the muses, his blonde hair in them waving in the air looking as beautiful as ever . Before Apollo could say anything he grab his arm and zip back to Thebes. He opened the door of the house\n\n\"Hermes, what the fuck man!\" Apollo yelled and pulled his arm back. Right after he yelled they heard crying coming from the bed. Apollo sweared he felt his heart drop for a moment he and Hermes quickly ran to the bed that the blanket was on.\n\n\"Alright Apollo act normal don't freak out, okay?\" Apollo nodded and Hermes went to the blanket and open it \n\nThe moment they say it they screamed causing the baby to become more stressed out. Apollo started to relax and picked her up\n\n\"calm down, calm down. It's okay\" cradling her and started sing a lullaby to her for her to calm down.  After a while she stopped crying then started to cooing at him. Hermes got closer and made a gesture to hold her. D\n\n\"she's beautiful...\" Hermes whispered as the baby started to fall asleep in his arms. They gently put her back down and then both moved to another room \n\n\"okay so...who's baby is that?!\" Apollo asked Hermes\n\n\"she...I think she's are sister\" Hermes replied\n\n\"WHAT!?\" Apollo yelled out \n\n\"remember when Zeus was hitting on that chick Semele. I think he got her pregnant and that's her kid. Zeus handed her to me to hide her from Hera\" Hermes explained with Apollo staying silent \n\n\"so...what now\" he asked\n\n\"I'm gonna look for someone to take care of her, in the mean time I'm gonna take care of her\"\n\n\"Hermes are you sure? With your schedule she is gonna be neglected I can help you take care of the kid\" Apollo said. After thinking about it he had a picture of a possible schedule\n\n\"Apollo can you before the night take care of the kid while I can care for her during the late morning and whenever you have time take care of her because of my jobs I can't take care of her until Sunday as that's when I can rest\"  Apollo thought about it and then nodded as he could do that \n\n\"my muses can also help us\" Apollo said which Hermes could definitely use.\n\n\"oh yea also what her name\" Apollo asked which make Hermes freeze up \n\n\"How about...d-dion\"\n\n\"ysus\" Apollo requested\n\n\"yea...Yeah! her name with be Dionysus\"\n\nDionysus spends 8 years with Hermes and Apollo and spends 2 years with ino then it all goes terribly wrong.\n\n \n\n \n\n              It's been 8 years sense that we found you in that blanket and they are three years I will always hold dear\n\nI still remember when you didn't have a name and it became a guessing game of what your name will be, in time of writing you have become a beautiful little girl that I will go on to call our daughter also  i wonder when are you gonna meet your daddy, he make be unreliable sometimes but he always appear when you least expect it.  Anyways I'm sorry I can't always be there with you because of work but even then I have gotten to see you grow up. it could be forty years yet you will forever be my little girl, who I care for deeply and wish to see thrive.\n\n\noh yea as for your other father how is he treating you? If he lays one single finger on you please let me know so him and I could...\"talk\",alright I sadly don't have much time left as I'm writing in my work place so I wanna say 5 simple word. \n\n\n\nI love you so much \n\n\n\nLove . \n\n\n\n\n\nHermes (aka papa)\n\n\n P.S if you see a woman named Hera,   run\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \"Come on dio sweetie wake up\" Hermes said with his calmest voice as he gently rocked dion to wake up. Dionysus gently open her eyes looking up at papa as her eyes lit up with excitement \n\n\"PAPA'S NOT AT WORK!, PAPA'S NOT AT WORK!\" Dionysus yelled as she sprung up excitement filling her voice,  this was one of the few moments she got to see Hermes making him being here even more a time to celebrate \n\nHermes just chuckled \"alright, alright my little lighting bolt lets gets you dressed up today is gonna be a big day for you\" he said while picking her up and being her to her closet. He picked out a toga that she liked to wear because in her words it was comfy. He changed her from her plain white sleeping gown to the cream color toga \n\n\"oh I nearly forgot, in one of my jobs I got this. Here\" Hermes held up a pendent that had grapes carved into it and also solid gold\" \n\nDionysus gasped then grabbed it saying \"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU\" hopping a bit will she held it. Hermes smiled and picked her up to walk to the other room. The first thing dio say was Apollo, mainly his sky blue eyes like zeuss \n\n\"Hi dada\" Dionysus said pulling Apollo out of concentration\n\n\"hello dion\" Apollo said pinching Dionysus cheek. Hermes places Dionysus to a chair and went to a big pot to make a soup for the three of them. Apollo sat down next to Dionysus to talk\n\n\"dion how do you feel?\"\n\n\"happy and you?\"\n\n\"im alright, is their anything you would change?\"\n\n\"I want to live in a big house with you guys dada\"\n\nApollo simply smiled petting her head\n\n\"When we done eating can I go out?\"\n\n\"of course dear\" \n\n\"Done!\" Hermes said bring two soups to them. Leaving to get his. The soup was made of lentil with bread next to it. Hermes sat down and after that they started eating. While eating they told jokes. Talk about random stuff. Chatted of what they are gonna do that day. Like going to the forest going to town and in Hermes word meeting someone.\n\nwhen dio finished she ran outside while Apollo and Hermes still ate. The forest was near her house so she went there. The deeper she went into it the more she saw. She saw goats, women walking in the forest. Birds not realizing the deeper she went the more she was lost. The moment she turned around she realize that she was lost. That moment the happiness she felt was gone and was replaced with fear. What was onces Lovley became different and mysterious. It all looked the same and she no longer saw her house or anything just trees, trees and more trees  she looked back and saw one of the women again.\n\n\"Hello?\" The women said seeing Dionysus\n\n\"H-hello can you help me?\" Dion said getting closer to her\n\n\"What's wrong dear\" the lady said\n\n\"I got lost from my home\" Dionysus said\n\n\"oh dear you poor thing, follow me she said giving her hand to her. Dionysus took it and started walking with her deeper in the forest. She suddenly stop and Dionysus looked\n\nShe saw many beautiful women dancing, swimming, talking and giggling, the ladies made Dionysus blush. Their where men and women who didn't look fully human they were half human but with the bottom part being that of a horse like the ones her dad's would tell her about when she struggled to sleep in her bed in the loud nights . They talked to each other, slept or galloped around. But what caught Dionysus eyes was men who looked have goat with horns legs of goat. Singing, eating, play the most Lovley of music. Or trying to talk to the women. the area she was in was filled with both fruits and flowers blowing and thriving all around there were many areas like ponds with sea animals in them of all types. Animals were everywhere eating to their hearts content. Or sleeping. There was just the right amount of sunlight in the area where it was never cold but never to hot.\n\nshe walked around looking at the place the women places her in. She turned and the women went the the other ladies and talk. Dionysus saw a young boy with tiny horse and the same goat legs as the older \"oh hello\" the young boy said to her\n\n\"hi...\" she responded looking at him\n\n\"I've never seen you here what's your name?\"\n\nDionysus thought if it would be a good idea to give him her name but he was her age so it would be okay, wouldn't it?\n\n\"I'm Dionysus\" she said\n\n\"my name is Ampelus\" the boy or Ampelus said \n\n\"Hey Dionysus what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I got lost from home when I went to walk\" Ampelus thought for a moment \n\n\"If you are gonna go to your family layer why don't you first spend some time here you know before the later?\"\n\n\"Ampelus I must leave my parents are worried for me\"\n\n\"Alrighty then but don't come crawling back to me later okay?\" Ampelus said in a joke way The more Dionysus though about it the more she though that it would not be a bad idea to stay here a little longer. While home was well homey this was new, something even many cunning men only dreamed of by the help of the sleep god...what's his name again? Hypnos. Right, right Hypnos. Papa and dada wouldn't mind having her see pure beauty for a while. Dionysus walked up to another of the ladies. She had long blonde hair. Green leaf eyes. Freckles on her checks and was barley wearing anything leaving her breast exposed \"Excuse me miss, can I stay here?\" Dion asked \"Of course you can. But make sure not to make a wreck of this place okay\" she said\n\ndion thought about it and nodded \"alight then get yourself comfortable here\" the lady said happily\n\nDionysus started walking around and went across the men with goat features playing music she carefully walked to them and ask if she could play on the pan pipes. They nodded and made her a new one. She stat down on a rock and she started place but Ampelus wasn't impressed\n\n\"No you're doing it all wrong here let me help you\"\n\nAmpelus started helping her how to play them properly and getting really close to her. The more she played the smother the music was becoming and she started relaxing her mind only being of the sound of the sweet music she was playing. She was a quick learner which made it more easy for Ampelus to teach her. She played and played until she was tired. She gave the pan pipes to Ampelus. He lifted her up from the rock and walk to the fruit area. He picked stuff like cherries to try out. She put one in her mouth and bit feeling the cherry explode in her mouth as she chewed she tried her best to savor the flavor. Getting another and doing the same thing \n\nAmpelus got some fruit for himself and ate with her next to him. When they were finished their hand were covered in red just like their mouths they fed each other until they f were full and no longer could eat anymore. To make sure that their food was digested they walk around so it would go down the area talking a bit of what they wanted to do in the future and about what Amp did before he met dion. They walked near the ladies who waved at them. It had been good over and hour as they walked around and laughed. They talk about bull riding which Amp boasted he was the greatest at it making Dionysus wonder how good he was. They talked about what Amp did before he met her, He said he would move from forest to forest trying out new things. Dionysus talked about how she surprisedly didn't know much of her parents or what they did. Where they worked at and more. After talkingAmpelus guided her to a gains tree in the middle and took her behind it\n\nDionysus was confused about why he brought her here. He asked if what he was about to do okay and Dionysus nodded just the Ampelus closed his eyes, and kissed her in the lips she was first in shock but by the second her mind was leaving her body as she couldn't think anymore yet also it screamed to her yes . So she just closed her eyes she kissed him back. His lips tasted like the fruits they had eaten and she wouldn't be surprised if her lips tasted the exact same. This boy had stolen her first kiss and she didn't even care about as she melted with him\n\nAfter god knows what time they parted the the kiss and just looked at each other \"I'm so so sorry\" Amp said \"no no it's okay\" Dionysus replied. With both of them walking from behind the tree.\n\nJust then in a flash both Apollo and Hermes appeared, both seeming to be in a panic\n\n\"WHERE IS SHE?!\" Hermes screamed at one of the ladies with some of the ladies turning into trees. The men and women who where half horse ran away while goat men ran with them. Hermes grab Dionysus by the arm bragging him. While amp hid behind the tree \n\n\"you can't even comprehend how much trouble you are in\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nDear Hermes, god of roads\n\n\n\nAfter much thought I would like to adopt the girl as my own to raise, \n\n\n\nshe truly is beautiful and I promise to take good care of her as I know she means a lot to you. \n\n\n\nPlease make sure taking her under my wing will not cause me or my husband pain in the future I wish to help her grow into the most Lovley demigod in this pantheon\n\n\n \n\n\n Signed \n\n\n\nqueen ino\n\n\n ", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"39958143\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"N/A\", \"Victim\": \"N/A\", \"Perpetrator\": \"N/A\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 38722188, "full_story": "Ilona lifted her hand, and even in the velvety darkness of the casket she could see the blood dripping from between her porcelain fingers. It oozed from the cracks, and she felt her anger return as she watched the blood trickle down her arm.\n\nShe thought of that man's audacity--of how he brought his club down upon her fragile body--and the contempt that sloshed within Ilona's body almost made her crawl back out of that casket. Almost made her return to the streets with her broken body, all to find the man that nearly destroyed her and tear out his throat. Her body might be damaged, but her teeth were still wondrously sharp. The man's flesh would yield easily to the diamond points.\n\nIlona didn't leave the safety of the casket though. The dollmaker could only mend so many cracks before she would have to replace parts of Ilona's body entirely, and new limbs took months to acclimate to. She would be even less equipped to take revenge upon the abhorrent man if her arms refused to move.\n\nSo she remained in her casket, her sanctuary. Ilona closed her eyes, and she imagined the glass orbs rattling about in her hollow skull.\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nThey were more likely floating in a sea of blood. The dollmaker said she was more ravenous than the previous dolls--her siblings. Ilona couldn't resist the call of the blood though. The dollmaker's own blood might have been too thin and bland to be palatable, but the city was filled with far more delectable people. Ilona particularly savored blood laced with dark wine, with bourbon and vodka and heavy beer.\n\nThat was, after all, why she'd initially targeted that man. He was a regular at Loretta's, and she could always smell the beer upon his breath.\n\n\n\nGood beer.\n\n\nHow was she supposed to know the drunkard could defend himself?\n\nShe rested her hands upon her chest, the lovingly carved fingers growing numb as more blood flowed from her body. Her green dress was probably stained beyond repair.\n\nIlona vowed to make the man suffer for ruining her dress. Perhaps she'd gouge his equally green eyes from his gaunt face before she tore him to shreds. A quick death seemed too merciful.\n\nHer fingers twitched once, twice, and then they stilled.\n\nSecond day, second prompt. There's some sexual content here, but nothing major, unless we're considering doppelganger sex to be incest. Then there's incest here, I guess.\n\nThe other Ash Holliday slept under the bed. Ash couldn't explain why a doppelganger of themself existed, nor could they answer why the creature was most comfortable on the cold floor, curled up beside Ash's collection of colorful sneakers. They could only shrug and accept the doppelganger's existence as a truth without explanation.\n\nAsh opened their eyes as they felt the touch of cool, chubby hands upon their face. They weren't sleeping--not really. The doppelganger always left its nest at the stroke of midnight. The creature crawled onto the bed, and it straddled Ash's hips. It was a being defined by strict routines.\n\nThe doppelganger's lips were cold upon Ash's own. It might have been a reflection of Ash's own plain appearance, all unremarkable eyes and lank hair, but it lacked Ash's warmth. The doppelganger had no life pumping through its own veins.\n\nIt had to seek Ash for heat.\n\nFor life.\n\nA low, content sigh left Ash as the doppelganger's hand slipped beneath the blankets and discovered the plump lips of their sex. \"Incorrigible,\" they murmured, but they still spread their legs to give the doppelganger better access to their pussy.\n\nThe doppelganger didn't answer them. It was incapable of speech--the loudest sounds it could muster being nothing more than breathy rasps. Anyone eavesdropping upon the lascivious scene in that bedroom would only ever hear Ash's low moans.\n\nAsh wound their arms around the doppelganger, and the mattress groaned as the two became entangled.\n\nBeneath them, under the mattress, laid the mess of Ash's shoes. A hand mirror, long forgotten by Ash, laid among the heap of bright canvas and dingy shoelaces, the polished surface as chilly as the doppelganger itself.\n\nSo, uh. In my defense, I had this written before the Roe v. Wade news last night. The forced pregnancy is coincidental. If that's an issue then give this story a pass.\n\nOther warnings include the implication of past rape and body horror. And centipedes, if that bothers you.\n\nThis short piece is a continuation of a story I wrote for the Like It Or Not zine. Johnny just continuing to have a horrible life.\n\n\"That's right, baby,\" Acid purred, hands holding Johnny's thighs spread and ratted hair tickling the back of his captive's neck. \"Just take those deep breaths.\"\n\n\nJohnny didn't respond to the creature. He instead bit back a pained sob as another contraction rolled through his body. He could feel small legs scrape against the delicate flesh of his vagina, and he felt his nausea peak as he saw the soft, translucent body of a plump centipede wriggle itself free from his body.\n\n\nTheir first child, finally hatched from the clutch of eggs nestled within Johnny. A long, segmented body--garishly red and lined with sharp legs--wound around the small centipede. Embracing it.\n\n\n\"You're doing so good,\" Acid praised, his dark lipstick leaving bruise-like smudges upon Johnny's shoulder. \"I wonder how many we'll have? You're so big, there's got to be at least twenty crawling around in there.\"\n\n\nAnother contraction, another agonized whine from Johnny. \"Make it stop,\" he pleaded. His eyes were wet, and the first tear rolled down his cheek as he felt the legs of a second centipede clawing its way out. He never had any desire for human children, let alone for a swarm of centipedes.\n\n\nBut Acid did, and Johnny simply had the misfortune of being the closest womb available.\n\n\nThe second centipede joined its sibling, leaving Johnny to the throes of his labor. Painted, clawed fingernails rubbed his thighs, but the soothing gesture meant nothing as Johnny thought of the ruins of his future.\n\nToday's prompt is about a satyr since I never really wrote anything about satyrs before. The only really warning is that it's sexually explicit, and there's some alcohol involved. The satyr must fuck.\n\n\"Follow the brown butterflies, and you'll meet a satyr.\"\n\nHe ran his fingers through the curls of the satyr's hair and brushed his fingers against the delicate wings of the butterfly settled upon the creature's crown. Dark wine was sticky and heady upon both their lips. The satyr kissed him and savored that taste.\n\nGrass tickled their flesh as they laid upon the earthen ground. The sun was low in the fire-orange sky, with the dense trees around them growing darker by the minute.\n\nThe narrow head of the satyr's cock pressed up against the man's anus, and then it was burrowing deep within him. His drunken gasp was easy, his limbs relaxed as he wound them around the satyr. The butterfly left the satyr's unkempt hair, and it spiraled into the sky.\n\nIt disappeared into the vibrant sunset, as though consumed by an inferno.\n\nA breathy laugh left him as he watched the butterfly disappear, only for the delirious sound to transform into a moan. The satyr wasted no time in pounding into him. He felt like a growing wildfire, consuming more and more of the forest around them.\n\nSoon he would join the fiery sunset as his orgasm burned away everything.\n\nI got a bit carried away with this prompt since they're supposed to all be short. I mean, it's still short, but not as short as the others.\n\nWarnings include a lot of violence and gore.\n\nSweat dripped from Artemis's brow as she scrabbled along the cavern wall.\n\nThe hunters had invaded  the den, and the pack was out hunting. She was alone, with the moonlit glow of her skin announcing her exact location. They hunters would find her, and they would slaughter her like a pig. As the superstition went, \"Consume the flesh of a witch cursed by the moon, and no disease will ever take you.\"\n\nThe Lord Barrone was afraid of disease, justifiably so as more and more pustules sprouted upon his flesh like dandelions. He was dying, and he was desperate. He would do anything to escape his rapidly approaching fate, even if it involved devouring Artemis's cursed flesh.\n\nArtemis shrieked as the hunter's torchlight fell upon her. His voice was loud and booming, and her terror turned his words into an incomprehensible blur. She heard more heavy footsteps. The hunters were gathering to claim their prey.\n\nThe men were soon upon her. Gloved hands grabbed her flaxen braids and yanked her arms behind her back. They wound coarse rope around her wrists, and when she screamed her contempt for their profane gods until one of the hunters smacked her. The leather stung, and she could feel an angry heat blossom upon one cheek.\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" one of the hunters said in a nasal, petulant voice. \"We don't want to be here when those wolves show up.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of the witch's lapdogs,\" the first of the hunters complained, but he offered no other protests. The men hoisted Artemis to her feet, and they dragged her from the cavern. Her dress was filthy and torn, and they shared cruel jokes among themselves over her unflattering appearance.\n\nShe wasn't one of the proper women from the village. She was unkempt and feral, and the curse marked her as incapable of the femininity the hunters hungered for. Artemis hoped their disgust would be a blessing in disguise. She hoped they would be too repulsed to take any pleasure from her, too bury their cocks in her unwilling body.\n\nA wolf howled outside the cavern, and the nasal hunter swore under his breath. \"They're already here,\" he shouted, and Artemis heard the thin whine of anxiety. \"Those worthless scouts!\"\n\n\"How are we supposed to get the witch out of here then?\" one of the hunter's companions demanded, but no answer ever arrived. The wolves poured from the trees, as though summoned by Artemis's ethereal glow. They crossed the field with their long, powerful limbs, and then they were upon the cavern.\n\nUpon the hunters.\n\nBlades sliced into the wolves, and rifles fired bullets into their flesh, but they were unrelenting in their assault. Artemis knew the silver had to be a burning agony, but the wolves refused to yield. They tore open throats and pulled limbs from their sockets. The resultant screams were haunting. They were the wails of animals in their death throes.\n\nBlood splattered upon Artemis's face as she fell to the muddy ground. She frantically rubbed the grime from her eyes, and then she looked at the savagery around her. Her heart pounded in her chest. She watched as the largest of the wolves, a graying creature littered with pale scars lifted the nasal hunter from the ground. The contemptible man was praying, the holy words a frantic babble from his bloodied lips.\n\nThe wolf snarled. He didn't know the gods of the hunters; the only divinity he knew was the moon-cursed woman on the ground. And so he squeezed the hunter's throat, crushing the man's esophagus and puncturing his arteries with sharpened claws. Blood sprayed from the hunter, and his body spasmed pathetically.\n\nArtemis watched on with wide eyes. The bitter taste of nausea crept up her own throat, and she knew  nightmares of that blood would pursue her for as long as she lived.The wolves tore the rope from her raw wrists after ever hunter laid motionless upon the ground, but she couldn't even muster the words to offer her gratitude.\n\nShe could only think of death.\n\nThe deaths of the hunters, of the lord wasting away on his throne, and of her own.\n\nOne of the wolves leaned in close, and she lapped away the blood upon Artemis's face.\n\nA short one today since my time is limited, but I hope you like creepy forests.\n\nNo warnings for this one, just trees.\n\nThe forest was dead--had been dead long before my grandfather purchased the land--and the bare trees were like bleached bones underneath the harsh sunlight. I wondered what they used to look like, covered in bark and green with life, but the idea seemed too preposterous. The trees once being anything but dead seemed like an outlandish fantasy.\n\nThey were dead, just as they'd always been dead.\n\nThe forest felt wrong with its absence of flora and fauna alike. I could walk among the trees in complete silence. No birds, no insects. Not even the howl of a wind. I could hear my blood pumping through my veins in that graveyard of trees,\n\nI had a macabre fondness for that dessicated wilderness, but I only visited the trees during the day. At night the silence of the forest gave way to a sickly groan. The trees would yank themselves from the ground, roots as pale as the dead branches, and they would prowl the land that belonged to my grandfather in name only.\n\nIt's about dragons today, and I've decided it's also about extreme gore today. Be a responsible pet owner and feed you dragon.\n\nDark blood bubbled forth from Briar's chapped lips as he looked up at the dragon. His hands--his painfully small hands--smoothed over the creature's oil-black scales. His nerves were still singing their chorus of agony, but the melody was drawing to a close.\n\n\n\nShock, probably.\n\n\nHis organs were beautifully wet and shiny as they laid upon the ground, gravel clinging to them as the dragon kicked them aside with its powerful legs.\n\nSpasms wracked Briar's narrow frame. His limbs grew weaker and weaker as his blood pooled around him. Briar's eyes felt heavy, like lead weights settled in the sockets of his skull.\n\nThe dragon leaned down and buried its muzzle in the fresh cavern of Briar's shredded abdomen. The creature didn't devour Briar, not yet. Dragons preferred to play with their meals before they gave into their hunger.\n\nA wet rasp left Briar, his face blue and gray and wide-eyed. The dragon's scales blurred into one incomprehensible mass, and then--\n\nAnd then--\n\nThe dragon opened its maw, and it began to feed.\n\nI feel a little guilty, not having as long or meaningful stuff as I did for the last Monstrous May. I'm still going to hash out each of these prompts though, because I want to see the challenge to its end.\n\nMore violence and gore for this prompt. This May is starting to look less horny and more grisly.\n\nTalons dug into the fat of her arms as the creature descended, all five eyes focused on her face. Her gun--a pretty Derringer with a lovingly engraved handle--fell from her fingers as shock took her. Her brother's corpse laid at her feet, belly already ruptured and skin a kaleidoscope of color.\n\nShe detested the idea of his corpse being fed to these disgusting creatures. She had wanted to chase the birds away, had wanted to take her brother and have him cremated instead.\n\nThe bird tore at her with its massive beak, taking away chunks of hair and leaving blood gashes instead. She screamed her frustration and pulled away from the creature, but it was relentless in its assault.\n\nShe stepped farther and farther from the bird, her brother's corpse forgotten until she stumbled against it, and then she was falling. She hit the ground with the resounding thud. Her breath left her lungs, and she looked around blindly. Her brother's body laid beside her, eyeless sockets oozing their decay.\n\nShe wanted to scream, but the bird swooped down upon her, claws taking her own eyes. She would face her death in darkness.\n\nI watched the Trolls movie once because I thought the texture choices in the animation were legitimately fun. Overall I disliked the movie though.\n\nThis troll is nothing like those fun and colorful cartoony ones. I'm pretty sure any songs it sings would be about drinking blood from the skulls of humans it tears apart. Anyway, be forewarned for violent sexual assault and death.\n\nThe scent of meat boiling within the thick broth wafted through the air, and Daisy's heart pounded erratically in her chest. She could see the flesh of her friends floating to the surface, joined by a swirl of wild onions and dandelion greens.\n\nHow she had nearly joined them--and could still join them--until the troll decided her body had better uses. The rough wood of the table scraped at her back as the troll forced her legs apart, revealing her small cock and anus. The troll's eyes were small and entirely black, and Daisy couldn't read the intentions behind its stare. She could only understand the language of its fingers as they pinched at her cock and tugged at her balls.\n\nDaisy pulled at the rope around her wrists, but the knots held. The skin was red and raw around the coarse rope, nearly as vivid as Daisy's dyed hair. She whined pitifully as she slammed her fists back against the table in frustration, but the troll was unphased.\n\nOne large finger brushed over her anus, and she felt a resurgence of nausea. The troll was too large and broad in every sense. She would be as torn to shreds as the bodies in the stew if it fucked her.\n\nThe troll cared little for her terror, if it cared at all. It forced that single finger into Daisy's unwilling body, and her shriek bounced off the cavern's walls. Her tender insides screamed their agony over the intrusion, and the claw threatened to puncture every spot it touched.\n\n\"Take it out,\" Daisy begged, but the troll only huffed in response. Its cock was a behemoth even when flaccid.\n\nIt was no longer soft though.\n\nThe cock was swelling with arousal, becoming so engorged that Daisy could feel her own looming death as she gazed upon it. Nothing could prepare her for such girth.Perhaps after the troll killed her she would be tossed in that pot with her friends, her flesh seasoned by the troll's desire.\n\nAn impatient snarl left the troll as it forced a second finger into Daisy. It would tear her asunder in order to accommodate its cock.\n\nI'm definitely rushing to force this story through, but also there's not a whole lot to warn for unless some cynicism about climate disaster applies.\n\nI used to make tuna salad sandwiches for lunch, back before they went extinct. Nothing else quite matched the taste, but canned mermaid was close.\n\nI pulled the tab, and the lid of the can peeled away to reveal the flaky meat contained within. The cartoon of the mermaid on the label was all bright colors, but the mermaid flesh itself was so pale it bordered on white.\n\nThe meat went into a bowl with a dollop of mayonnaise and minced onion. They blended together into a sea of white. An unappealing sight that made me long for the days when I still had tuna.\n\nThe store only had white bread, so I smeared the paste on a doughy slice. I covered it with a second slice, and then it disappeared into my well-used lunchbag with a couple crab apples from the tree outside.\n\nI had seen documentaries about mermaids while staying up into the late hours of the night. They seemed so romantic in the cartoons of my childhood, with their human charm. But the mermaids that dominated the oceans were vacant-eyed and listless, more like any other fish than the singing princesses of my childhood.\n\nIt was a bit sad to see how I'd been duped into a humanistic majesty that never existed, but it did make the canned mermaid easier to swallow.\n\nThe can disappeared into the recycling bin, the cartoon mermaid's smile almost sarcastic in its cheeriness. Mermaids were still plentiful in the ocean, but I wondered how long they would continue to thrive. My childhood cartoons also neglected to capture all the variances of human nature.\n\nHow many of us consumed and consumed, leaving only extinction and adorable cans in our wake? And it was so easy to consume when working seventy hours a week gave me time for nothing else.\n\nI left my little apartment for the flooded streets below, like a mermaid of the city as I carried my lunchbag in one hand.\n\nToday is a short one, but I wanted to write something about a monster that thrives in the dark. Be forewarned for some sexual content.\n\nHands like shadows wandered over Amihan's dark, tattoo-littered skin. They teased at the lines of black and red and violet, the shaded pomegranates and bones. The hallway was so dark that she couldn't tell if her eyes were even open. All she could do was lean forward and brace herself against the brick wall.\n\nOne hand slipped under her pleather skirt, and the wispy fingers tugged at her scant panties. More hands ventured beneath her ratty shirt. Her nipples were hard beneath the chilled touches of the fingers, the small of her back yielding to one wide palm.\n\nAmihan's painted lips parted as a surprised gasp left her, and two fingers intruded upon the heat of her wet mouth. She didn't know what these creatures exploring her body looked like--maybe they were indistinguishable from the darkness itself.\n\nFingers slid past her panties, and she whined as the chill of those creatures breached the intimate folds of her sex.\n\nThe cold of the hallway couldn't touch her then, not as the fingers labored over the fire growing within her.\n\nI wrote a tiny piece about zombies today. Be warned for gore and death that's typical of zombie settings.\n\nThe embalmer's head fell back, and the gash along his throat spread into a visceral grin. Maggots glistened among the rotting flesh like a set of teeth. Not everyone could host the maggots as they developed into adults, and the embalmer was one such case. Despite this the repulsive creatures would still tried to take control of his corpse. They wriggled deeper and deeper into this flesh.\n\nKayde watched as the corpse's hands twitched ineffectually. The insects couldn't force the embalmer to do anything more substantial. \"Think we should burn the body anyway?\" Luanne asked, her southern drawl muffled by the hazmat suit. \"Don't think he's going anywhere, but can't be too sure.\"\n\n\"We don't have that much gas left,\" Kayde responded. \"Let's just leave him. If they're infecting him they're not infecting anyone they can actually move.\"\n\nLuanne hummed to herself. \"Is that how it works?\" she asked, and she prodded the corpse with a broom handle. The embalmer's abdomen was swollen and straining against the buttons of his ruined shirt.\n\nKayde turned from the body and shifted the duffel bag slung over his shoulder. \"Stop that,\" he chided. \"The last thing we need is that shit exploding on us.\" Even if the embalmer couldn't move there were plenty of corpses that could move lurking throughout the neighborhood, shambling around at the behest of the insects burrowed in their decomposing flesh.\n\nAnd Kayde didn't want the swarmed to be alerted to their presence when the emtvrbalmer burst. One corpse might be harmless, but a swarm could overpower them--could tear away their hazmat suits and vomit clusters of translucent eggs down their throats.\n\nLuanne whined her protest, but she dropped the broom handle. Unlike Kayde, she derived a macabre pleasure from the death and decay that now defined their world. Her delight made his stomach roll with nausea.\n\n\"Don't be gross,\" Kayde rebuked, and he walked away.\n\nI didn't have much an idea for today, so it's something really short today. Nothing really needing a warning, unless zombies are an issue.\n\nThe farther he descended into the waters the deeper the chill permeated his flesh. All the while the shark's rough scales brushed against him. It was too dark to see the predator, but he could imagine its rotted face--its empty eye sockets and cartilage poking forth from the decay.\n\nCuriosity had its price, and his body would be offered up to pay that debt. The shark would make certain of that.\n\nMan, I don't even know what to say about this one. Warnings for some language that verges in self-harm ideation, I guess. And unreality.\n\n\n\"I need to speak to you.\"\n\n\nI found those five words scrawled over and over throughout my apartment. Upon the aging fridge and cupboards, scrawling along the hallway walls, upon the bedroom ceiling. All in the same garish red, the same looping letters.\n\n\n\n\"I need to speak to you.\"\n\n\nThe windows were sealed shut, and the door immobile upon it's hinges. I was a prisoner in a house without an exit, no matter how hard I pounded on the window-glass and hammered at the door.\n\n\n\n\"I need to speak with you.\"\n\n\nThe specter repeated those words like a mantra. I wondered if those words were even carved into my bones. If I peeled away my skin and muscles would that same distinct writing be there, etched down into the marrow?\n\n\n\n\"I need to speak with you.\"\n\n\nI ate the remaining saltines in the cupboards and I drank tap water straight from the faucet. I reread the same books about burning farms and young girls running through swirling ash. I scribbled out the reappearing red requests with the stubs of crayons.\n\n\n\n\"I need to speak with you.\"\n\n\nThe words appeared the most at sunset, when the sky outside was an inferno and the clouds were thick tendrils of smoke. Every demand I crossed out was replaced by a new one.\n\n\n\n\"I need to speak with you.\"\n\n\nWhen I ran out of crayons I broke the lightbulbs. I retreated to a darkness where the words could not touch me. If the words cut through that darkness--if they started to glow like the sunset or the burning fires or my ghastly white bones--then I would gouge out my eyes.\n\n\n\n\"I need to speak with you.\"\n\n\nThose words would have to be written on my empty sockets, into the tender flesh that once cradled my eyes.\n\n\n\n\"I need to speak with you.\"\n\n\nMy house smelled of ash, and I could imagine the hands behind those words having that same scent. Fingers that spoke a language of destruction, even when writing five otherwise innocuous words.\n\n\"I need to speak with you.\"\n\nLook, I was gonna use this prompt to write about Jude and the Fairy. Of course I was.\n\nAs far as warnings go there's some light sexual content here.\n\nJude's hand smoothed over the Fairy's calf as his lips settled upon her knobbly knee. The bedroom smelled of nail polish, and the bottle was forgotten by Jude's crouched form. The Fairy's nails were like opals in the incandescent light, immaculate in contrast to the black paint chipping on Jude's own fingernails.\n\nThe Fairy raised her hands high above her head, and she marveled at the ethereal rainbow contained within that nail polish. She sat upon the bed, like a ghost against the dark blankets. \"Pretty,\" she breathed. Her white pupils were invisible among the milky sea of her eyes, but Jude could still tell how focused they were on the paint.\n\nShe'd always been fascinated by his own painted nails. Supposedly the fairies had no cosmetics of their own, only gauzy white garments and strands of teeth to adorn their colorless bodies, so the world of makeup was a constant mystery to the Fairy.\n\n\"I thought you'd like that one,\" Jude murmured. The nail polishes he wore were all dark and simple colors--black, dark blue, khaki green, and royal purple--so he'd purchased that shade just for her.\n\nHe wondered what else she would like. Would she enjoy eyeshadow that shimmered like the sea? How would she feel about lipstick, with even the palest colors vibrant against her tooth-white skin?\n\nHis hand ventured down her calf and cradled her pronounced ankle. Jude was mindful of her drying toenails as he handled her tiny foot.\n\nThe Fairy looked back down at Jude. Her still-damp hair hung in long tendrils, unlike the curls that never left Jude's own tousled mane. The heat of the bath might have long left them, but Jude could feel a new warmth spread across his chest and face as he kissed the Fairy's knee again before moving his lips to the soft flesh of her thigh.\n\nThe smallest of smiles graced the Fairy as she spread her legs. The lips of her sex were an endearing sight, and the slick opening nestled between them made Jude's mouth water, just as it always did.\n\n\"You're always so good to me,\" the Fairy said, voice like an ethereal melody. She always sounded like the wind and spring rain somehow condensed into a single being. Jude kissed her thigh again and again, creeping ever closer to her delicate pussy.\n\n\"I love you,\" he murmured, and he could hear her soft laugh in response.\n\n\"And I love you,\" the Fairy replied, and her eyes slipped shut as Jude's mouth descended upon those inviting folds. Her hands splayed upon the flannel blanket as she minded the painted nails.\n\nI didn't have much of a plan for this one. I just remembered a time when some clouds in the sky looked like a castle.\n\nNo real warnings for this one.\n\n\nOffer three bundles of black grapes and a moonstone bathed into storm water to the maiden of the Loess Cliffs. Kneel before the statue, clap three times, and then the Lord's castle will appear.\n\n\nThe dewy blades of grass clung to Sienna's bare legs as she looked up at the weather-worn statue. She clapped her callused hands--once, twice, thrice--and closed her eyes. The statue's passive face was immobile as always. It looked to the night sky, at the stars as pale as its granite surface.\n\nKnobbly hands like dark clouds descended from the sky, like the seeking grasp of an unnamed god. And then it appeared between those fingers.\n\nThe silhouette of a castle, darker than the indigo sky itself. Windows like starlight, the entire majesty hanging upside-down between those hands.\n\nSienna disappeared then. The hands spirited her away to the phantom in the sky, with the statue's stoic gaze revealing nothing.\n\nI guess I need to warn for some light body horror with this one. Or maybe it's not light at all, maybe it's pure body horror.\n\nOh well. be cautious of body parts doing what body parts should not be doing.\n\nI could hear the call of the sirens, the song like a drone burrowing into the whorls of my brain. The stories of their song being an achingly beautiful melody was a myth, a fiction to obscure the truth of those repulsive creatures that lined the beach.\n\nThey stared at my lit windows with their sunken, storm-gray eyes, teeth stained with old blood as they serenaded me. Their voices were foghorns over the crashing waves as they sang their complex words, all from a language older than the ocean itself.\n\nThe music made my head pound, as though my brain itself was hammering against my confining skull. I wanted to take a chisel to my forehead to chip the bone away and free my brain from its prison. I wondered how it would look--how the call of the sirens reshaped the tender gray curls.\n\nWould I hear their same song come from deep within my brain, that same eerie foghorn bellowing over the ocean waves?\n\nI'm here, I'm here. Sorry, I was distracted today. Guess be mindful of unreality today, and maybe some light body horror.\n\nHer smile widened, her blue-white teeth large in her mouth. I always tried to count her teeth--she always seemed to have too many--but time and time again I lost count. \"We missed you at the meeting,\" she said, her thin lips nearly invisible as they stretched to reveal those teeth. \"Were you feeling sick again?\"\n\n\"Oh. Uh, yeah,\" I answered, and I wished she would leave already. I'd had worse neighbors in my life, but her persistence had a way of burrowing under my skin. Plus, she had ulterior motives.\n\nHer face contorted into a mockery of sympathy. \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,\" she cooed. The wind tugged at the bleached wisps of her hair, pulling them free from her immaculately styled bob. \"Maybe next time then? There's been concerns about the disappearances in our community, and I think your involvement would be so helpful.\"\n\nHer mouth closed and I lost count of those teeth. I think I'd counted thirty along that top row, but I was no longer sure. \"Oh, the dog attacks?\" I said as I crouched down to check my little flower box. The pansies looked up at me with their disgruntled faces, all white and yellow and purple. \"You know I don't have any dogs.\"\n\nThe corner of her mouth twitched. \"Yes, the dog attacks,\" she replied, and for a brief moment she looked irritated. It was the only sincere expression I'd ever seen her make. \"Well, even if you don't have a dog you might have seen something we haven't.\" Her smile returned, and I looked at the bottom row of her teeth. The countless teeth, all perfectly straight and brilliant.\n\n\"I doubt it.\" I said. \"But I guess I'll let you know if anything comes up.\"\n\n \n\nShe closed her mouth again, and I forgot how many teeth I'd counted, just as I always did.\n\nToday sucks, here's a quick bit of undead wraith porn.\n\nElijah braced himself against the crumbling wall as the wraith's knobbly hand lifted his leg higher and higher, spreading Elijah so wide that his hips protested the stretch. Elijah would have toppled over if not for the mausoleum.\n\n\nThe wraith's cock protruded from layers of their white robe, the fabric gauzy and rotted from time. Even the rush of arousal brought warmth to the creature's gray skin. Elijah's eyes still fluttered shut though as the head breached the folds of his pussy. \"Yeah, like that,\" he breathed even though he knew the wraith wouldn't answer him.\n\n\nThe wraith's dirty nails instead dug into the ample flesh of his thigh as they pressed the entirety of their cock into Elijah. They moved slowly, as though the rapid thrusts that Elijah was so used to would destroy the wraith's fragile body.\n\n\nAnd so the creature fucked Elijah slowly and tenderly.\n\nI wanted to write Beelzebub porn, and so I wrote Beelzebub porn. I also threw in some fun painplay and also probably some light blasphemy.\n\nThe angel tilted their head back as a shaky gasp left them, a sound that reverberated off the high ceilings of the throne room. They were a scrap of divinity--barely more holy than the humans that reigned over the earth with their chaotic impulses.\n\nBeelzebub dragged one of his long, spindly claws across the angel's chest. The glowing skin split, and golden ichor welled up within the wound. It spilled in rivulets over the angel's soft belly and over the triangle of their pubic mound. The angel made a pained sound, but their expression only spoke of euphoria. They were in the throes of ecstasy, as though they were communing with their God and not the Lord of the Flies.\n\nBeelzebub's chitinous fingers combed through the angel's ashen hair. He had multiple consorts. Humans as dark as the night sky, humans with hair the red-orange of roaring wildfire. Artists with paint-stained fingers and farmers tanned from a life under the sun. Muscular men and fat women and sharp-boned androgynes. The devout and the cynical. The passionate and the apathetic.\n\nThey embodied the plethora of human experiences, his beloved consorts. The angel was different though; they were the first divine creature to share his bed.\n\nThe angel's fingers slipped free from their anus. The hole twitched, glistening and pleading for Beelzebub's cock. The angel didn't say anything, just as they never did. Their words were a secret that even Beelzebub couldn't unravel.\n\nHe took his cock in his hand, the entire length a disconcerting amalgamation of red and pink swirls. The head pressed against that waiting anus, forcing its way into the angel's body. A sob left the angel as the cock stretched them beyond their limits. Beelzebub was so large, and the angel was so small.\n\nHis red compound eyes drank in the sight of the angel in that state of both ecstasy and anguish, and all the while the heat that sheathed his cock burned. It was holy fire, and his demon blood shrieked within its vicinity. The pain was bliss for him in the way it was bliss for the angel. They were two masochists seeking each other out for more glorious pain and suffering.\n\nBeelzebub's claws tore at the angel's fleshy hips as he began to fuck him. His lovely new consort moaned their satisfaction, ethereal as they bounced upon the demon's cock.\n\nA prompt is a prompt, and I've written something. No major warnings, it's just a scrap of an idea.\n\nHands beneath the river, formed of mud and fish bones and rusted cans.\n\n \n\nThey grabbed at my legs and pulled me under.\n\n \n\nBrown water filled my lungs as I slipped further and further into that polluted kingdom.\n\nNo real warnings again, save for a creepy garden gnome. I really, really, REALLY didn't know what to do with this one.\n\nI hated that garden gnome. It's yellow shirt was bleached white by the sun, and the paint was flaking off in large chunks. At one point it might have been smiling, but nature had destroyed its face. An eroded chasm existed now dominated its head. It was an eyesore among the roses and marigolds and the tiny vegetable patch, but my mother was attached to the little monstrosity. A gift from her father when he was still alive, she said.\n\nI looked out the kitchen window and to the garden gnome. A tiny wren clambered into the gnome, and like every other creature that dared to explore that abyss I knew it wouldn't reappear. The tomatoes were beautifully red, and the peppers blended into the plants' lush greenery.\n\nMy mother was at the table, cup of coffee between her brittle hands. Her smile widened after the wren vanished. And then she took another sip of her drink.\n\nI burned my hand today, so I didn't really want to write, and I couldn't really get into writing monster plant porn even though that's a brand of horny I really like.\n\nBut there is some smut here, so it's okay.\n\nAdalia sighed--oh that beautiful sigh--as she sank down upon those green tendrils unfurling from the vine. She was alone in her boudoir, with the plant basking before the large window as her only companion.  Her preferred companion, if she was honest. The men that vied for her attention were obnoxious in their confidence, in how they talked at her without so much as pausing to let her respond.\n\nThe tendrils slipped past her folds and into her waiting body. They explored her sex gingerly, with a gentleness she received from no one else.\n\nHer breasts spilled over her brocade corset. Adalia's nipples were as rosy as the blooms that covered her lover. She wanted to curl up within one of those flowers, safe and distanced from the world she increasingly despised.\n\nThe tendrils then began to thrust into Adalia, and she soon devolved into a series of gasps and squeals.\n\nI'm honestly surprised I've made it so far with this set of prompts, even though it's because a lot of them have been exceptionally short. It's still nice to see.\n\nSexual content is ahead, but it's nothing major.\n\nThey lived alone in the ruins of the workshop. Their creator had died years ago--heart having ruptured within his frail body--and so they'd took over the work he'd started.\n\nNeither Mercury nor Jupiter had their creator's talent though. Every doll they made never became more than a collection of joints and limbs and blank glass eyes. Life never crystallized within their creations in the way that it had manifested within themselves.\n\nAnd so they became accustomed to their seclusion. No siblings would ever join them within the decaying laboratory. Mercury and Jupiter only had each other.\n\nMercury shivered as he laid upon the workshop table, legs spread to display the lovingly carved curves and folds of his sex. Their lovemaking was a hollow imitation of humanity's, less performed out of desire and more out of habit. Their creator had loved being sandwiched between Mercury and Jupiter as he'd taken from their bodies.\n\nJupiter's cock slipped inside Mercury, and the two dolls entwined their limbs around each other as they fucked on that workshop table where the bodies of their failed siblings had once lain. The room was bleak with it's water-stained ceiling and moldy walls, but neither doll took note of the decay.\n\nI already kind of had a story with about angels, but that was for another prompt. This one is fine, it's a good chunk of body horror, because my favorite type of angels are the surreal body horror type.\n\nClaws like needles of light punctured my flesh, and I smelled the faint scent of cooking meat. The angels of my mother's ceramic collection--delicate figures with wide eyes and white wings--were nowhere to be seen in this deplorable kingdom of heaven.\n\nThey stared at me with their infinite eyes as they sang in voices like the chimes of church bells. The claws left my skin. Blood welled up from the countless wounds, as though to herald the glassy eyes that then emerged from the gore. They gazed both everywhere and nowhere, the dark pupils framed by eerily pale blue.\n\nA mosaic of mouths curved into appreciative smiles as my body transformed into the monstrous divine. \"Holy, holy, holy,\" they sang.\n\nI'm emotionally fried, and I don't have much to say about today's prompt. It probably deserves more attention than I gave it. Oh well.\n\nNo warnings for this one.\n\nI laid my small hands upon the wall, and I could feel the hum. The swarms moved beneath the layers of insulation and drywall and velvet-flocked wallpaper. The vibrations were a chorus, each of those small creatures speaking in unison.\n\nMy hands spasmed in pain, so I clenched and reopened them until the tendons resettled. The hum always sank into my flesh until my bones themselves were rattling. I hated the sound, just as I hated the decay of the apartment.\n\nBut the rent was cheap.\n\nI didn't really know what to do with this, so I brought back Raoul and the King for the occasion. No real warnings here, which is surprising given uh, the dynamic between these two.\n\nRaoul ran his hands over the cool gold bars of his cage. The king was sleeping, as large as a mountain upon his bed. Sometimes the giant would sleep the days away, as though he couldn't bear the sight of his ruined kingdom. He was, after all, alone save for the farmer he kept imprisoned like a song bird.\n\nEven the embers within the fireplace had long since died. The winter chill seeped into the bedchamber without the fire to keep it at bay. Raoul stepped away from the bars, and he crawled back under the blankets and pelts upon his bed. The giant saw Raoul as little more than a toy to humor him during his lonely days, but at least he kept Raoul well-fed and warm.\n\nHe buried his face between one of the blankets and blocked out the sight of the cavernous room. He could hear the king's snores. The sound made the entire bedchamber vibrate, and Raoul let the noise enshroud him just as the pelts and blankets did.\n\nIt's sex today. Beasts get to be horny too.\n\nThe Beast of the Smaragdos Wilds was described as a patchwork quilt of various animals. The wings of a raven and the paws of a bear. The sleek musculature of a cougar and the muzzle of a wolf. And red, red fur--brilliant like a fox's.\n\nBut no one had ever mentioned the Beast's eyes, how they were like polished obsidian set in that monstrous skull.\n\nAmber saw those eyes time and time again. They were beautiful, just as the rest of the Beast was beautiful.\n\nHow could she have ever resisted the Beast's embrace?\n\nThe creature was sprawled out within its den, eyes appraising Amber with that mysterious gaze as she ran her hands through its thick fur. Fingers ventured between the Beast's legs, and they eventually found the long slit of its pussy. Amber's mouth watered at the sight.\n\nHow could she have ever resisted bringing her lips to the Beast's sex and tasted the heat that no other human did?She teased at the delicate folds that framed that opening, and her tongue plunged into the Beast. A rumble left the creature--a content sound that Amber basked in. The fur tickled her face, but she ignored the sensation. Only that pussy mattered to her.\n\nThe Beast of the Smaragdos Wilds devoured all humans that ventured into its domain, but in the cavern it was instead the prey. And Amber feasted upon the Beast.\n\nI'm close to done. I wish I'd had more time to invest in this, but the prompts have been fun. No warnings for this one either, I guess.\n\nThe river was my beloved and my beloved alone. Even as the prairie erupted into an inferno she was there for me, a sanctuary in the midst of the orange flames and pillars of dark smoke. I sank into her embrace as the cries of crows echoed overhead.\n\nThe cabin was forsaken, as were the bodies within. My parents had been lost even before the fire consumed their bloated corpses. I'd been abandoned with not even a spare bullet to return me to my family.\n\nHands emerged from the water and cradled my soot-streaked and charred body. The smoke burned my throat and lungs, but then the river kissed me. Those lips were a balm for my aching body, and I slipped deep into the water.\n\nI'm bringing back Asterion and Bronte for this one because I didn't have any other ideas. Consequently there's some sexual content here. Bronte getting the dick they want.\n\nBronte knelt before the Minotaur, knees scuffed and streaked with dirt, and their pink tongue flicked out over the broad head of the creature's cock. That arousal was too long and too thick for Bronte to even dream to taking it into their mouth, but they still delighted in lapping at the imposing cock. The taste of salt and skin was addictive, as was the content huffs that left the Minotaur.\n\nTheir tongue laved over the pronounced veins and it teased at the slit. How many times had Bronte braced themself against a labyrinth wall and yowled as that cock plunged into them, reshaping their insides until they were cradling the entirety of its weight.\n\nBronte could spend the rest of their existence worshiping that cock. They reached down and palmed at their own small, soft cock as they continued to kneel down before the Minotaur, lips and tongue unceasing.\n\nA day late, but it's here, and now the challenge has come to a close. No real warnings for this one, except for maybe body horror?\n\nAll five bodies were laid to rest in their shallow graves, all in a neat row. A doctor, a set of twins, a taxidermist,  and a camgirl. The freshly disturbed earth was as dark as the sky above. The soil offered a sanctuary from the lit world above, both for the corpses and the worms.\n\nAnd those worms, so translucent that their delicate organs were visible, burrowed into the bodies offered to them. They feasted upon the decaying flesh, their segmented bodies swelling more and more. Pustules sprouted upon the worms, their skin incapable of obscuring the red growths forming within. They were embryos, the union of the worms and the corpses.\n\nThose embryos would be nourished by the bodies, and soon, when they were large enough to survive on their own, they would burst from the worms. They would escape the dark earth then, with the night sky greeting them as they crawled out to the land above.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"38722188\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"decay\", \"Victim\": \"doctor\", \"Perpetrator\": \"worms\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"decay\", \"Victim\": \"twins\", \"Perpetrator\": \"worms\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"decay\", \"Victim\": \"taxidermist\", \"Perpetrator\": \"worms\"}, \"death_event_4\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"decay\", \"Victim\": \"camgirl\", \"Perpetrator\": \"worms\"} } ```"}
{"work_id": 38985855, "full_story": "Artemis watched as her huntresses practiced their archery. They were the finest archers that the world had ever seen. They could hunt and track for leagues without issue. Even the devotees of her brother and rival, Apollo, could not match the skill of these women here. Plus, without the interruptions of men, these women had nothing to focus on but honing their skills. These mountains of forestry were true paradise for her. Though she would be lying if she said that she did not have other purposes for acquiring the most beautiful women she could find and training them to be her devotees. Even though she was supposed to be one of the divine maidens, she could not help but be tempted by these gorgeous women. She wanted them, wanted to claim them. Sitting in her temple, Artemis contemplated how she was going to get her first concubine. These huntress had been taught that their femininity and virginity was sacred and that none were supposed to take it. She would now have to find a way to get them to believe otherwise. \n\nThen lightning struck her brain as an idea came to her. She could host a grand challenge, a competition and the winner would spend a night with her in the temple alone. She would promise it would be a night of great boons and honor. A prize worth a thousand lifetimes. That would entice even the most reluctant to compete she thought. Though the competition mattered little other than getting one of them to stay with her for a night. Walking out of her temple, she quickly put on her loincloth, barely able to contain her excitement. Holding up her hand to the sky as she called out, \n\n\"Huntresses! Come to me!\" \n\nOnce they were all assembled, she smiled. \n\n\"I am going to host a very special challenge. A hunt unlike any I've ever had you do, tracking a beast deadlier than any you've ever faced. Any of you can choose to abstain from the challenge if you wish, but those of you who compete have a chance for a boon worth more than any gold or jewels. A night with me showered in my splendor and a gift worthy of a goddess. She smiled, proud of her con. \n\n\"What say you?\" \n\nShe asked before giving any further details.\n\nOut of the many hunters she had, most were weary of their goddesses objective. Some of the older girls knew the goddess was usually hiding a trick or two up her sleeve when it came to granting rewards and boons. But in the end, three of the girls offered themselves for the task, willing to go out and hunt the beast like no other in hopes of pleasing their patron....\n\nThat had been two weeks ago. And now, the lone survivor of the girls had returned with a Griffins coat in tow and her body fully battleworn. She presented the coat of intricate feathers to her goddess and immediately felt cleansed of all dirt and grime from simply being in Artemis' luminous presence. \n\n\"My lady..... might I claim the boon now and share your company within your temple?\"\n\nCaeda requested softly, keeping her head bowed whilst kneeling at the steps leading up to Artemis' temple.\n\nSeeing the Griffin coat, it made her smile, as Artemis already had plans for what she could do with it. Slaying a griffin was no small task for a mortal, and to do it alone where others had failed, that was no small boast. This woman indeed was a strong huntress and warrior. The thought of fucking this woman, robbing her of her precious virtue, it was thrilling to her. She could barely contain her desire and her lust. She watched as the girl's wounds vanished, her strength returning and fatigue fading. At the girl's words, she beckoned her to follow with the motion of a single finger. Then she turned and entered the temple. With her back to the girl, she immediately took off her loincloth and then spoke. \n\n\"You shall indeed receive the boon of my company and your gift, but this is my temple and we do not allow things like clothes or armor to be worn in these sacred halls. This is a place of nature, and as such we are to be as nature made us.\" \n\nArtemis spoke in a clear tone, looking over her shoulder and waiting to see the young girl strip. \n\n\"I'm waiting.\" \n\nShe drawled impatiently, twisting her back a bit more and folding her arms across her busty chest. Still, she kept the swollen rod between her legs hidden for the most part.\n\nCaeda followed silently up the polished marble staircase, in awe at the power radiating from the staircase alone. Once she was at the entrance, her cheeks burned a deep crimson as the goddess commanded her to disrobe. \n\n\"...a-as you wish my lady...\"\n\nCaeda murmured softly. She began to pull off her armor and weapons, setting them down before her clothing fell away as well and her nude body showcased the faint scars that littered her skin. She wore them proudly, having gained them in the servitude of her goddess after all. Caeda walked up to the goddess and shuddered at the cool breeze that entered the temple around them, causing her nipples to harden significantly. \n\n\"....what now my goddess...\"\n\nSeeing the girl's young, slender, and muscular form before her, she could not wait any longer. She needed her now. She grabbed the girl by the throat, lifting her off the ground and carrying her over to the bedchamber that had been prepared for the Goddess, even though she did not need sleep. She smirked as she forcefully slammed her down onto the bed. She moved her body next to the girl's head, letting her see the monster of a shaft that was pointing out from her pelvis. With a chuckle, she looked at the girl. \n\n\"You get your 'gift' of motherhood. You will be the first to bear the child of Artemis!\" \n\nThen she moved over top of the teen, straddling her legs and holding them together with her own stronger legs. Sure, it would be easier to penetrate her with her legs spread, but she did not want this to be easy, plus doing so would have made it less painful for the girl as well. \n\n\"You're going to bear me a strong, beautiful line of daughters... you'll be part of my finest breeding stock now..\"\n\nArtemis breathed out heavily.\n\n\"Aren't you?\" \n\nHer tone was full of challenge as she looked down on her seventeen year old maiden. \n\nCaeda's hands shot out, holding tightly at Artemis' godly grip around her throat, fearing for her life in that moment until she was thrown into the deity's bed and pinned. \n\n\"My lady no! Not my virtue!\"\n\nShe reasoned, trying to push the unmoveable weight of the goddess from overtop of her naked body. Caeda had no luck in moving Artemis, so she grasped desperately for the edge of the bed, pulling herself with all of her strength until her body roughly turned and she tried to get away, feeling the godly monster of a penis slap between her firm asscheeks instead. This also gave an easier route to her hairless pussy without having to spread her legs at all.\n\n\"Let me go! Goddess please!\"\n\nCaeda couldn't move anymore, Artemis' godly weight growing heavier with the more she resisted.\n\nThe goddess looked down as the woman begged, trying to push herself free. She smirked, just the sheer fact that she would try to deny a goddess showed more fighting spirit than most mortals. She would indeed bear a strong, powerful child. Though, resistance cannot be tolerated. She smacks the girl firmly across the face as she growls in her ear. \n\n\"You will do as your goddess commands. Do not question me again.\" \n\nShe hissed in a stern, almost cruel tone. \n\nSeeing the bare pussy on full display for her, she placed a hand on the girl's lower back and pushed down a bit, making her bend more. Then she took her hand and ran it along the girl's slit. Glistening juices immediately coated her finger, and as she sucked her finger clean the divine taste had her moaning in bliss. \n\n\"You act like you don't want this, but your body tells the truth.\" \n\nShe placed the tip of her cock against the hole, then pressed just enough that the head would start to spread her lips but not fully enter her. \n\n\"Do you love your goddess?\" \n\nArtemis asked curiously with a smirk.\n\nCaeda's nipples hardened painfully as a chain reaction to the contact of Artemis' fat cock head pressed up against her cunt. She shuddered and let the tears flow freely, the tear droplets wetting the bed as her womb began to burn. Being in the presence of a fertility goddess whom intended to breed caused her womb to eagerly ready itself to create life from the potential divine seed. \n\n\"....please goddess.... I love my goddess... don't do this to me!\"\n\nCaeda's voice cracked as she begged. She was shaking as her wet cunt began to spread, not putting up the slightest fight against the godly cock that was going to enter her.\n\nThe goddess just watched as she saw the girl sobbing onto the bed. She smacked her ass firmly with one hand an then continued to push her hips further down. First, the cock head entered the narrow, human passage. It was a good thing her walls were so wet and had already started stretching for her. She could hardly contain herself, but she did not want this over quickly. Artemis wanted to savor every one of this girl's reactions. She wanted to take her time with this oro huntress. She started kissing her neck as she slowly slipped deeper until she met a bit of resistance and smirked. \n\n\"Push your hips towards me and rip your virtue on my cock, or I'm going to get very rough with you.\" \n\nArtemis then smacked the girl's ass for emphasis. Her cock was already throbbing in the tight, wet canal. \n\n\"You thought I gather women as gorgeous and powerful as yourself with no intention ofclaiming them? Don't tell me you're that naive.\"\n\nCaeda gasped out, her body trembling as she pushed up on her hands, wincing from the ass jiggling slap. She didn't want to anger her goddess, the love she held for the moon deity outweighed the fear and anger she felt about losing her virtue. \n\n\"Y-Yes m'lady...\"\n\nHer hips shifted as she pushed up on her palms and then rocked a little bit, flinching from how painful the cock felt inside of her stretched out cunt. Taking a deep breath, she suddenly went for it, slamming her hips back fully and destroying her hymen. A loud cry escaped pass her lips and she slumped down into the bed again, blood coating the goddesses cock as proof of her virtue sacrifice to her patron. \n\nWhilst outside of the temple, some of the huntresses avoided the suspicious cries of their sister in the temple being raped by the moon goddess.\n\nArtemis was loving this, the loyal obedience, the unquestioning loyalty. This girl did not want to be fucked, did not want her virtue taken, but because her patron goddess had demanded it, she sacrificed her virginity to the mammoth rod of her goddess. The feeling of the fat, juicy toned ass slamming against her pelvis felt incredible, and she loved the way it jiggled from the impact. Then as the goddess leaned herself forward, a wide smile grew across Artemis' face, seeing the blood trailing down her shaft. \n\n\"Such an obedient little slut.\" \n\nShe said and smacked the girl's ass, this time far more playfully. \n\nThen she pushed the teen's head down onto the bed, and let her hand run down the girl's back to her waist. \n\n\"But we're not done yet.\" \n\nShe grabbed Caeda's hips in both hands, pulling them back roughly and began to thrust, her balls slapping loudly, painfully against the girl's clit. She did not care that the girl screamed, she did not care if the huntresses outside grew curious. Right now, she had a fertile female to breed, one whose body was more than accommodating her every need. She slammed in faster and faster, knowing her balls would bruise the girl's clit, just like her rod would bruise her cervix. Artemis moaned as her cock began to throb. \n\n\"Are you ready for my seed? Are you ready to bear my child?\"\n\nArtemis moaned, lowering her lips to Caeda's ear and licking the lobe lightly. \n\nSaid girl huffed into the bed, breasts swaying and jiggling with every thrust. She felt herself burning from the inside out, the goddesses girth incredibly hot and pulsating wildly in her cunt. There was truly no stopping the goddess. Not when she seemed to have a very clear mission at hand. \n\n\"....my lady.... please....\"\n\nCaeda pleaded, gasping out haggardly as her pelvis bulged with every thrust, accommodating such a large cock. To carry a god's offspring should be the biggest honor, but she felt more terrified than anything. \n\nFrom across the temple bed chambers, Artemis had a secret audience of one of the younger Huntresses. She was only ten years old, Vivian was her name. The child was wide eyed in wonder, watching the goddess make her sister huntress moan and cry into the large bed. Viv was so confused by what was going on.\n\nThe way her body felt was incredible, Artemis had begun to see why men seemed so obsessed with conquering women. In fact, she was beginning to wonder if she should just breed all her huntresses and then go out and find more. The more she slammed into this girl, the more her balls ached and her cock throbbed. She gripped the teen by the back of the head, pushing her hard into the mattress. She began slamming her hips into her with all the force she could muster. \n\n\"You don't have to beg me to breed you, lovely. That's what I'm going to do!\" \n\nThen at last she began to cum, shooting rope after rope of a thick golden cream into the girls cunt. She did not stop thrusting, letting her juices run out of the girl and onto the bed beneath them. Then she smiled when she finally pulled out, shooting more of her spunk over Caeda's raped body. \n\n\"You're the first to be blessed by my seed dear, but make sure you tell no one of what happened. Am I clear?\"\n\nCaeda's womb accepted the seed hungrily, causing her belly to glow softly before the light began fading as Artemis' cock pulled out of her stretched pussy. Godly seed oozed out of her gaping cunt as sobs wracked the teens sweaty body and she fisted the bedsheets in defeat. It took her a few minutes to recover before she was able to get up from the bed, bowing in respect to her goddess before hurrying out of the temple with tears in her hazel eyes. Caeda dressed quickly at the temple stairs and avoided the gaze of all the other huntresses whilst striking out to go hunt something and burn away some anger. \n\n\"M'lady.... why was Caeda crying?\"\n\nVivian spoke up, coming out of the shadows and playing with the hem of her dress. She really should not have been spying on them.\n\nThe goddess was pleased with her self. Despite the fact that she had just committed one of the acts that she claimed only men would do to these huntresses, the rush she felt from it was incredible. Her desire to further ruin and mate with more of her huntresses increased exponentially. She wanted to break someone. Then she heard a small, timid voice. Her eyes went wide with panic and anger. She grabbed the small child by the back of her neck.\n\n\"YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU ARE NEVER TO ENTER MY CHAMBERS WITHOUT PERMISSION!\"\n\nHer voice rang out, filling the entire room. She backhanded the girl across the face before throwing her face down onto the bed. \n\n\"You will speak when spoken to. This was a training exercise for Caeda, she failed. Let's see if your will is stronger.\" \n\nIt was of course a lie, but the child was likely too naiive to know that. She growled as she slapped the kid firmly on her ass once, then again and again. Grabbing the panties of the young girl, she ripped them off. Then she began to spank the girl's bare ass, turning it pink. \n\n\"Beg for my forgiveness! Beg to be spared from my wrath!\"\n\nVivian screamed out, not one for pain tolerance like the older girls as she was spanked ruthlessly with her heavy handed goddess. The child sobbed and trembled in the bed, kicking her legs every so often to try and scoot away from the lust hungry moon goddess. \n\n\"I'm sorry! M'lady! Sorry!\"\n\nViv cried out, her red butt jiggling as she kicked away again but couldn't get very far. It was like a game of cat and mouse, the goddess was simply toying with her until she decided what to do with her. \n\n\"F-Forgive me!\"\n\nShe hicupped, burying her watery eyes and red face against the bed covers to try and muffle the cries that were escaping her soft lips...\n\nThe goddess, seething from rage, still spanked the child's ass while she begged until the skin was glowing red and would sting when touched. Afterwards, she laid the child flat on the bed, rolling her onto her back, knowing that her now sore ass was going to be pressed into the mattress, causing her pain. Then she ripped open the girl's dress with one hand. The petite body made a smile grow across Artemis face. Looking down at the girl's tiny bare cunt, she licked her lips. \n\n\"I'm going to make you stronger too...\" \n\nShe grabbed the girl by the throat as she began to rub her cock on the girl's slit. It was still slick with the mixture of her cum and Caeda's juices. The thought of adding Caeda's juices into this girl made her smirk. \n\n\"You want to be a strong huntress, don't you?\"\n\nArtemis waited for the child's answer, but once she got it, she began to squeeze the girl's throat. She cut off her air supply as she got ready to shove her cock in. There would be no screaming this time. She did not want to risk someone older and less gullible walking in. Wasting no more time, she began to push her hips against the girl. Her tiny pussy seemed far too small for the huge cock. At first she was just pushing against the surface as the hole seemed to refuse to give. Then finally with enough pressure, she forced her way in. She did not stop, she completely buried herself in this girl, shredding her hymen and causing her stomach to bulge up nearly to her chest.\n\nSad as it was to admit, the ten year old was far to caught up in the tunnel vision consuming her vision, to fully process the blinding pain that was following as her cunt was forcefully ripped into, way more blood soaking the goddesses divine cock and acting as a decent lubricant. As her organs rearranged, most likely bruising internally, a cold chill filled the room quite suddenly. It wrapped around the pair and was followed by the scent of insence and strong masculine cologne. \n\n\"You're proving to be a much more interesting niece than any other I've had the pleasure of watching grow into godhood.\"\n\nThat voice, bone chilling and deep as it was, belonged to none other than the god of the underworld, Hades himself. Cold and strong, his hand wrapped around Artemis' slender throat, his jewelled rings digging against her luminous flesh. Hades was one of the big three, he was not a weak god in any way or form. \n\n\"...look at you.... choking this child to the brink of death... your power precedes you Artemis.... so let me fix that...\"\n\nHades' clothing shimmered in black smoke, baring his naked body to the temple as he forced Artemis to slam down onto the bed, lodging her cock even further up the child's ripped cunt as he mounted her from behind and unceremoniously began choking her lightly as his monstrous cock began to invade her sacred untouched cunt. \n\n\".....take my cock like a godly whore....\"\n\nHades hissed before slamming his hips into her, lodging his dick balls deep into her cunt. He was stretching her so much, her gold blood drenching his cock and dripping down his hairy ballsack as he began to thrust into her. Every hump causing her to push into the girl beneath them as he chose to rape the moon goddess and be the one god that ever claimed her cunt virginity.\n\nShe kissed the girl as she ravaged and raped her small, helpless form. Pushing her tongue into the girl's mouth, her power would keep the girl alive, even if she was literally killing her by choking her. The thrill of holding such a power over someone so innocent gave her a dark and sinister pleasure. \n\nThough speaking of dark and sinister, when the voice that could only be Hades, emerged from the darkness, a chill went up her spine. Lord Hades, king of the underworld, god of the dead had arrived in her sacred grove. Her arousal from the very presence of this man caused her cock to grow longer and her cunt to drool more than it already was. When he grabbed her throat, his rings digging into her neck, she was all but his. He could have done anything in this moment and she would have begged and thanked him for it. Often, her dreams had been filled by being defiled by one of the big three, the most common of these dreams had been Hades. Despite what everyone often said about him, she knew Hades was not evil. Cruel, demanding, powerful, yes, but not evil. Death was fair, so the god of the dead was the same. The child's tears streamed down her face as she was ripped and torn beyond all belief as the power of two gods thrusting into her nearly broke her tiny frame. Even her hips had dislocated, but then were being healed by the power Artemis held over the female form. When Hades' grip slacked just enough for her to speak she whispered. \n\n\"T-thank you, m'lord.\"\n\nArtemis' insides felt like a cold fire was burning inside of her. The savage pain of Hades cock ripping her virginity was a divine horror. It was heaven and hell, agony and ecstasy. And with each thrust, she got to break this girl some more. Finally she began to cum, filling this girl with her seed, but then glanced back at Hades. \n\n\"Her... ass... put me.... in... her ass, please....\"\n\nHer voice begged to destroy this girl's more sinful hole.\n\nHades however did not care for Artemis' request, but rather cloaked the woman's dick in darkness and caused it to press through shadows, reappearing against her own butthole as if through a portal. \n\n\"Stick it in your own ass, you filthy freak.\"\n\nHe growled against her ear, slapping her butt hard and watching her own cock begin to thrust lewdly up into her unprepared ass. He shuddered at the power he held over her, grabbing her hips and pulling her back roughly against his cock rapidly. His eyes closed as he focused on his own pleasure, using her body for his own whims. The same way she had done the small trembling girl beneath her. Whatever her name was, Hades took pity on her, combining his healing with hers and healing the girl until it left her in a dreamless sleep on the same bed they were fucking on like animals.\n\nBeing fucked by Hades was everything she could ever want and more. He was cold and degrading. Feeling the shadows move her cock, she did not know what else to say or do. She simply obeyed. She shoved her hips forward, and as they did, her cock rammed into her own unused, unlubed ass. The only slight relief was the blood and cum that was already on her shaft. She violated herself, the thick cock stretching her hole to the point of ripping. The power of Hades' thrusts forcing her to her knees and elbows. Then Artemis began to feel a tugging on her nipple, followd by fluid rushing out of it. Her eyes went wider.\n\n\"Th-this is... not... allowed.... she's... drinking my... milk.\" \n\nIt was one of the rules that she had made, even though she was a goddess of fertility and an eternal virgin, her body always produced milk and she had forbidden humans from ever tasting it. \n\n\"I... must... be better... than.... that whore... Persephone...\"\n\nHades seemed unamused by the young girl that was latched on to Artemis' breast, suckling her milk desperately. He lifted a hand, redressing her in the guise of shadows and returning her to the warmth of her own bed somewhere in the huntress camp down below. He then summoned Cerberus in his puppy form, smirking down at Artemis' as the three headed puppy sniffed around her boobs and two out of the three heads latched on to a nipple each, suckling more ravenously than the human child had been. They weren't even gentle about their claws either, pawing against her large milk sagging breasts and hungrily drinking her milk like they were starving. \n\n\"Who knew, you'd be a useful cow yet.\"\n\nHades mocked, encircling Artemis' flat and toned belly with his cold hands. A devious smile filtered across his lips as he thrusted into her a few more times and then began to cum, seeding her womb with his potent load, caressing her belly as it began to swell and swell until life could definitely be felt inside. Godly pregnancies were instantaneous, which was why he seemed so smug as he pulled out of her, watching his cum dribble out of her ruined cunt.\n\n\"I hope childbirth is especially agonizing for you... maybe Hera will make sure to it..\"\n\nHades smirked, dissolving into shadows along with Cerberus, back to the pits of the underworld he had come from. The shadows around her cock disappeared, making her erection swing between her thighs, going immediately limp...", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"38985855\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"tearing\", \"Victim\": \"girl's hymen\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Artemis\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"violation\", \"Victim\": \"girl\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Artemis\"}, \"death_event_3\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"spiritual death\", \"Victim\": \"Artemis' virginity\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Hades\"}, \"death_event_4\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"dreamless sleep\", \"Victim\": \"girl\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Hades/Artemis\"} } ```"}

He took it as a challenge and laughed. His laugh was melodic. Beautiful and positive. Like him. Happy, amazing, beautiful. He wore a white toga, draped over his tan skin. And hair as brown as wood, as pretty as nature. \n\nWe were in a sunny field playing, as we both loved sports. He grabbed a diskus. \"Watch me\", he said teasingly.

Behold the blood of Hyacinthus, which had poured out on the ground from his head and stained the grass, and it changed from blood; \n\nand in its place a flower, more beautiful than royal phonecian, was born. Almost seemed like a lily, were it not that one was purple and the other white. But I was not satisfied with this. If he should leave, he would leave a trail of his happiness. I worked the magic of my sadness on flower leaves. These letters AI, AI, are inscribed on them.\n\nThe sounds of my crying when he fell shall be inscribed in the flower. \n\nThe sun sets and it darkens. I kissed him for the last. \n\nGoodbye, Hyacinthus. I love you.\n\nThe sun rests.\n\n\n(See the end of the chapter for notes.)\n\n\n(tw: mentioned non con)not detailed))\n\nThere was a girl, and there was a god, and there was me. The god is Eros, the god of love. The girl was Daphne, a river nymph whose beauty could rival Aphrodite's herself. And I was the god of the sun, amongst many other things. One of those was Archery. \n\nI saw Eros with his bow and arrows, preparing for his job. That day I was mad, as I had lost a match with my sister, Artemis. Eros was hiding behind a tree, watching a couple in the woods.\n\"Ah-ah-ah, what are you doing with those weapons, don't you think its too powerful for you?\" I said, smirking. Eros however, did not think that was funny. He scowled. \"That equipment of yours doesn't even fit you. Those weapons are for those who have power, as I have just slain the Python, whereas you will be content to provoke some loves by your arrow.\" I look back on it and I realize that may have not been the best thing to do. \n\nEros may be the god of love, but with love comes heartbreak.\n\nThe insulted god glared at me through his eyes. He hadnt said anything, he just walked away.\n\nI should have not thought he would let me go. \n\nThe god of love then prepared two arrows, as i have learnt. One of gold, was of lead. For the god of love, he was filled with hatred. He shot the golden arrow at me, and the lead to a river nymph, Daphne. Those arrows were magic, shot after each other, would become connected. Gold arrows bring out all the love you could ever have for a person to exist, lead arrows are the opposite. Lead arrows bring out all the hatred you have for a person to the surface. When those arrows are intertwined, so are you.\n\nI met Daphne as i was walking in the woods. There was something within me, something embedded in my soul. A voice whispering in my head, driving me mad with desire to enter this woods. Maybe I was possessed. Somewhere in me drove me to the place deep in the woods, where I first saw her. The only time I have felt this love was with Hyacinthus. Maybe that was a clue that this would end in failure. My failure.\n\nShe was sitting on a rock, making a bow. Scrape scrape, went the blade, her delicate hands hold it as she carved. I could have watched her all day, for it not she have noticed me. She looked up and her eyes met mine. Whereas mine was filled with pure, pure, pure, lust, but hers filled with rage, and pure hatred. Her piercing eyes met mine, and I, the god of many things, a god whom has fought many monsters, but i have never seen such hatred as i saw in her eyes. Like a rake, seeing my future, my past, and my present. Combing my soul, seeing the dark parts. Seeing what I will do to her.\n\nI regret what i have done, but at that time-- i would not be swayed. I followed her relentlessly, I chased her, not stopping. I wanted her, I intended to have her. But if i had truly loved her I would have let go. Is it love if I had loved her, i would have dedicated my life to her, but i caused her destruction. I should have let her go. But instead i chased her.\n\nI left her no choice, and she sacrified her life to turn into a tree. She prayed to the god Peneus, and he took mercy, and now she is lost forever. Leaving me, just as Hyacinthus had. Both my fault. If only I didnt fight Zephyros, if only i didnt fight Eros, she might have loved me. I laid on the ground of the tree, weeping. I might died with such pain, different from the sinking numbness of Hyacinthus, the poison of his death seeping into my heart. But this was different, a different pain. It was like a sharp knife, my guilt melded into a knife, stabbing me many times with no mercy. A parallel to what i have done. No mercy. \n\nIs this the guilt and sorrow that makes mortals die?\n\nIf i could, i would. But thats ridiculous. I could not die. I would live on, each passing moment with grief for my two loves. I pray to Daphne for her forgiveness. \n\nI dared Zephyros, the West Wind, who also loved Hyacinthus. I dared him to take him away from me. My greed caused his death.\n\nI taunted Eros, and my mockery of him is what drove Daphne to her death.\n\nThe stories say i chased her on whim, that she was just another pretty face. The stories are wrong. When she became a tree, i could feel part of my heart turn into bark as well. \n\nShe became a laurel tree, and i took her leaves and crafted a wreath--- the laurel wreath. Funny---the laurel wreath was made from failure, my failure, yet it is given to heroes for their victory. Each time some hero wins, it reminds me i failed.\n\nI caused the death of them.\n\nI knelt at the ground.\n\n\"Forgive me\"\n\nThe sun rests.\n\n(hi so i realized since this is from apollo's pov, it may seem like its romanticizing this---- which, no. thats not what i mean to do. I do not think actions like this is okay. Do not do this. Respect people's boundaries. I tried to make it as not detailed as possible as i do not agree on anyone that these actions are okay. I do not mean to romanticize anything.)(this is different from Hyacinthus and Apollo, as Hyacinthus apparently loved him too.)(its just the daphne/apollo thats non/con (including apollo's other lovers.... Yeah its... just.. yeah.)DONT do r@pe)\n\nIn Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book I: Apollo and Daphne, Ovid uses animals to make the emotions of characters more relatable to the reader. Ovid characterizes Apollo's pursuit for Daphne as more animalistic than human, and creates the metaphor of a predator and its prey to show the connection between the two. Ovid writes, \"sic agna lupum, sic cerva leonem, sic aquilam penna fugiunt trepidante columbae,\" meaning, \n\n\"Thus a young lamb flees the wolf, thus the doe flees the lion, thus the dove flees the eagle, wing trembling.\"\n\n Each animal that is being preyed on is fleeing from its predator, and in each case the predator is as the stronger animal. The word \"fugere\" shows the urgency about and genuine fear of the predator. Ovid uses the word \"fugiunt\" in the present tense, showing that the prey is still fleeing its predator.(so theres clearly alot wrong with apollo and daphne, and i point out i dont want to romanticize it. I hope i explained this.)\n\nDont chase after people when they say no", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"38717322\", \"death_event_1\": { \"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"poison\", \"Victim\": \"Hyacinthus\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zephyros\" }, \"death_event_2\": { \"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"transformation\", \"Victim\": \"Daphne\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Apollo\" } } ```"}

auden\n\ni watched him leave, the bitter lump in my throat coming slowly undone as he disappeared in a shimmer, carrying along the slightest scent of the ocean with him. i could hear thunder rumbling already, she was angry. i had been defiled in her temple after all, forced against the sea god with the threat of death, it was only right that she would strike him down for a few millennia.\n\nbut it was not to be.\n\na sudden flash of bright light and she stood before me, her gray eyes glowing with rage. she stood there terrifying and beautiful. i fell to my knees, hoping that she'd understand that it wasn't my fault, i never wanted this to happen. i dared to look into her eyes and saw the pity behind the mask of fury she wore. she knew.\n\ncupping my face into her hands she stared deeply into my eyes, my hazel meeting her steely gray. she kissed my forehead lightly, and suddenly it felt like a flame had been lit inside me. i watched in horror as my nails grew into talons, my hair grew heavier, and it felt like it was replaced with a writhing mass. i watched my goddess as she loomed over me, offering the slightest of smiles at my new form.\n\n\"no one can hurt you now,\" she said. her voice full of regret, she didn't want this anymore than i did. she knew, but there was nothing to be done.\n\nthis was my gift and my curse.\n\nthe day started out like any other, the scent of crushed pine needles and juniper berries arousing me from my dreams, my ears pricking up slightly as i hear soft footfalls coming outside my cavern, it's not my sisters, i can smell their scent on the cots adjacent to mine. third time this week. \n\ni stretch luxuriously, my eyes still closed as i bat away brutus as his forked tongue tries to lick my cheek, it's his way of wishing me good morning, i hear cleo hiss angrily on the other side of my head, she's always a grumpy riser. stretching my arm above my head as i make way to the mouth of my cave to investigate the sound, even though i have a pretty good idea of what it is.\n\nas if on cue i hear a man yell it seems to be on my right, i sense the faintest whisper of metal as i picture the sword he's holding slice through the air, not that it'd do him any good, since my transformation mortal metals no longer affected me, my skin seemed to harden whenever a sword came into contact.\n\ni felt the blade hit my shoulder and i winced, just because it couldn't kill me doesn't mean i'm impervious to the sting. i feel andromeda rear up, preparing to strike the stranger for attempting to hurt me, brutus follows suit and without my eyes opening once the man is paralysed, screaming in shock as my snake's venom enters his blood. i slowly open my eyes, watching the man convulse on the floor, being careful not to look him in the face as i watch his stomach heave. he won't die, my snakes aren't potent enough to really kill him, only paralyse. \n\nsoon enough though his screams of pain rouse my sisters, who quickly make short work of their meal. i wrinkle my nose in disgust as i hear them cracking bones as they eat. even though i am the one who became the first gorgon my sisters are the actual monsters. i never liked eating my victims, i usually just keep them as decorations.\n\nbut despite my disdain for their culinary tastes the scent of blood stirs my hunger. i need to hunt. grabbing a bow and arrow i make my way to the mouth of the cavern before i turn around.\n\n\"i'm going out.\" i call to my sisters, i see eurydice wave her hand briefly before going back to her meal, sucking marrow from bone.\n\ni make my way into the courtyard, blinking away the honey colored sunlight as i pick my way through the statues, making sure to touch the face of a particularly handsome youth before i make my way down to the forest surrounding the side of my mountain. i sigh in relief as the cool air brushes over me, keeping my ears pricked to listen for deer.\n\nstopping by a small pond i look out from behind a tree carefully, if I look into the eyes of my prey it'll turn to stone becoming useless to me.\n\na faun.\n\ntaking a drink from the pond, it's legs still wobbly as it tries to keep balance. the mother must be by somewhere. as quietly as i can I notch an arrow, holding my breath as i aim steadily for the fauns neck. it would be a clean kill, had brutus and calypso had not decided to fight one another. the deer looks up immediately, nostrils flaring as it picks up my scent. i let loose an arrow.\n\ni hear a small bleat of pain, and a stronger cry from what i presume to be the fauns mother. as i make my way to it i see the doe, nuzzling it's baby trying to make it stand. my arrow had pierced it's leg. the mother notices me and bolts, only running a small distance before turning around to cry for it's baby. \n\ni kneel before it offering a prayer in thanks to artemis and apollo, and as an afterthought athena. i stroke it's soft fur, and hear it's piercing cries but there's nothing i can do. with the mother watching me i bring my knife to the faun's throat, one smooth press and a jerk of it's leg and it stills. the mother calls out once or twice before heading into another part of the forest.\n\ni sigh heavily and lean back against a tree. my life wasn't always this hard.\n\nby the time i get back the stranger's body has chunks of muscle torn out of his arms. inwardly i cringe, staring at the cold pools of blood that had wet the stone beneath him. i try not to look at his face, if i did that he'd turn to stone and my sisters would be unhappy. the faun is heavy in my arms, it's limp carcass halfway slung across my shoulders. \n\ni try not to eat humans, but in the beginning i had no control over my bloodlust, and for that me and my sisters are hunted by \"heroes,\" foolish mortals who claim that the gods sent them, unaware that a goddess is the one who gave me this protection in the first place. the heroes are always male, and even after all these years i still cannot bring myself to let one touch me. i know it's not their fault, i know that, but every time one gets close i panic and my snakes do their job for me. \n\ni set the faun down by the smoldering fire, making my way to the back entrance of the cavern where a boy with golden armor and a colt with silver and gold wings are playing. the two good things that the sea god has given me. my sons play, chrysaor trying unsuccessfully mount his older brother who just bucks him off whenever he gets himself on his back. i smile as i head back inside to prepare the faun for lunch, i think chrysaor would enjoy a stew, though pegasus will most certainly not eat any of the meat. \n\nchrysaor is very hungry, as he always is whenever he wrestles with his brother, he smiles as he eats and despite the fact that his face resembles his father i find myself loving him more and more everyday. maybe the gods decided to be merciful to me for once when they gifted me my children, immortals that don't fear to look me in the eyes, blessings that are not repulsed by the filed down boar tusks that protrude from my lips or the snakes in my hair.\n\npegasus is asleep by the fire, his oversized wings spread out to cover his small body like a blanket. his brown-gold coat covered by a silver wing. he had been content to eat an apple eurydice had given him from one of the trees that grew in her garden. despite the fact that she claims she dislikes them she spoils pegasus whenever they're alone, giving him the juiciest fruit and best grain from the garden that she grows alongside her poisonous plants. \n\nthe way my sons were brought into this world was very strange, my body had been pregnant but unable to give birth, i felt them move, felt their kicks, and the pain in my womb was unbearable, no matter how many months past i was unable to release them, they were trapped in my mortal body for three years. and then a hero came, swinging a sword that was not of mortal metal wildly and screaming like cerberus himself was chasing him, he swung towards my head, and from my blood chrysaor and pegasus had emerged, wet and crying, chrysaor on the cold stone ground wailing his head off, pegasus not moving. \n\nwhen i first saw them i was so terrified that i just backed away, clutching my womb where it was no longer full, a hollow feeling forming in the pit of my stomach. if it wasn't for eurydice who dried them off and fed them goats milk they would've been left there. \n\neventually i came around to see them, pegasus was trying to stand and chrysaor watching him, eurydice keeping an eye on them until i decided to see them myself. i got closer to them as time went on, though chrysaor originally terrified me enough that i wouldn't look him in the eyes. i was afraid that i would accidentally turn him into stone and when that fear passed it was because he had the same eye color as his father.\n\ni adore both of my sons now, which is why i shove chrysaor behind me when he is on his way to clean his bowl, causing it to  shatter when i push him too roughly, my snakes hissing in warning as i taste the scent of a human in the air. they're in my den, i hear a sharp crack-a statue was toppled over. pegasus starts from his nap, moving behind me as i take a step toward where the noise is coming from.\n\ni love my sons, and i will protect them as long as i live.\n\nchrysaor unsheathed his sword, a long golden blade that is able to hurt me, a gift from his father on his 6th name day. he cherishes it deeply, even when knowing how he and his brother came to be. \n\ni push him back, brutus hissing at him in warning, this isn't a child's game, this isn't him wrestling with pegasus, who has awoken from his nap and is staring at the entryway, nostrils flaring and eyes wide, his fledgling wings ruffling. \n\nwithout warning pegasus bolts, his body becoming a mottled blur as he raced out of our cavern. fear overtakes me and without thinking i run after him into the courtyard. \n\nthe sun has begun to set and i already see artemis's chariot ascending into the sky, the sky a purplish bruise that dusts the many statues  surrounding the entrance of the cave in a haze. fearfully i look around for pegasus, but i do not see him. a soft voice alerts me, like the sound of water dripping over the rocks during the spring showers, demeter crying in joy at the return of kore. \n\n\"nice horse, you won't hurt me will you?...is there a bird somewhere nearby, i feel feathers...\"\n\npegasus.\n\nmy snakes start hissing excitedly, content to hear something of the whereabouts of my son. slowly i make my way towards the noise, eyes closed as i pick my way carefully through some broken statues, the voice sounded feminine, maybe not a hero.\n\nas i move forward my dress snags on a pointy piece, a sword probably, or a hand. i stumble and topple one of the statues.\n\n\"who-whose there?\"\n\ni hear pegasus whinny, trying to calm the person no doubt. \n\n\"mortal, what is your purpose for intruding on my lair?\" \n\n\"mortal?\" the voice, definitely a female says, she sounds confused, why is she confused?\n\n\"do not play games or you will face my wrath!\" my snakes are for once silent. why are they silent? what's going on? \n\ni feel a soft nudge on my hand, pegasus has come to stand beside me. hurriedly i open my eyes to where his golden ones meet my pale yellow. a pleading look.\n\nmy attention turns to the woman before me, wearing strange clothes that contrast starkly against her olive complexion, and with a hiss brutus covers my eyes to prevent me from accidentally looking into hers.\n\nit is obvious why he does this though at first a spell of confusion washes over me, he must see the pale milky film that fills her eyes, and for the first time in millennia i am ever grateful  for the snakes that adorn my hair.\n\na blind woman stares at me, her face blank and confused, she hears the hissing of snakes and the soft snorting of my son but no more than this, this is all i can afford to see.\n\naround me the statues that have haunted my memories crumble to dust.\n\nthere is no use hiding anymore.\n\nshe speaks first, voice surprisingly calm, \"is this some kind of prank? the guys will pop out at any second right?\" she swirls around suddenly, stumbling around with her arms outstretched, expecting to feel the statue that she bumped into earlier and instead feeling nothing. the statues have crumbled to dust millennia ago, and the only thing that had kept them from completely washing away was my memory of them.\n\nhere was a farmer who sought revenge for a sheep i had killed, there was a drunken man who had tried to force himself onto me, and there closest to the entrance was a man dressed in strange attire, a helmet on his head that had blonde curls, a strange metal bird had crashed near here and he held a metal stick that shot round pebbles, he shot pegasus and i had no choice. he was still here, the only one left. though his face had been weathered away.\n\nthe woman before me came too close, and brutes hissed a warning, she jolted back and i realized how strange the clothes she wears are, a blue fabric covered her legs while another type was covering her torso, and strange shoes she wore, much like the man with the stick. i don't know how much time has passed, i've been hidden away, even my sister had left, though she tried to persuade me to go with her. i didn't and in the end it was just eurydice and i, who refused to leave her garden behind. \n\n\"who are you?\" i ask, i have to know how much time i've missed, how many decades.\n\nthe woman looks my way, her milky eyes staring above my head. \"briseis. \" \n\ni recoil instantly, my back going stiff. a cursed name she beared, oh cruel gods what destruction do you intend upon me? she was the catalyst of the downfall to the great hero achilles, i flinch when pegasus suddenly nudges me out of my stupor. patience has never been his virtue.\n\n\"dude chill out.\" she interrupts me, and the way she speaks makes me pause. what is a dude? \"my mom just liked greek myths and she saddled me with this name.\"\n\n\"myths?\" \n\n\"you know, pegasus and perseus, hades and persephone, medusa?\"\n\n\"how do you know my name?\"\n\nshe laughs, and the sound of it infuriates me. beside me pegasus snorts in indignation, but i can see that he's spooked about it too.\n\n\"i'm wearing a ring of her, see?\" she shoves her ring in my face and as my eyes adjust to it i see myself looking back, snakes coiled around my head and her finger, fuller lips than my own and her eyes have no pupil in them. how has this blacksmith seen me? and she's wearing it like it's just an accessory, like i'm some sort of accessory.\n\nthe setting sun behind me illuminates the courtyard around us, and with all of my willpower i ask her a single question. \n\n\"what year is this?\"\n\nthe woman before me blinks slowly, trying to process what i'm saying, her milk colored eyes are staring right at me, and it's unnerving, i'm careful not to look her in the eyes, instead focusing on her hands, long shapely things, perfect for playing the lyre.\n\ni'm not used to being looked at head on, perhaps i once was, but now? no. \n\n\"it's 2019.\" she says finally. beside me pegasus snorts a bit, but i sense that she is telling me the truth. it's been four millennia since my transformation. two millenia since my son's were born, and three when my sister left.\n\nthe wind shifts and i am able to smell the scent of the ocean on it's current, immediately i feel nauseous. four millennia and nothing has changed, or has it?\n\n\"what of the gods?\"\n\n\"the gods?\" her expression turns confused. she has freckles, they contrast nicely with her skin, i used to have them too, but this skin rejected all of my flaws, even the ones i liked. it's not athena's fault, she was ensuring that i had protection, even pretty flaws had to be washed away.\n\n\"you know, athena, artemis, apollo...poseidon.\" pegasus snorts and stamps his hoof into the ground, unlike his younger brother he is ashamed of his lineage. \"where are they?\"\n\nbriseis looks at me again, an even more confused expression on her face. \"i don't know what you're on but those gods don't exist. they never have.\"\n\n \n\nthe dust swirls around our feet as i stare dumbfounded at briseis. i can vaguely hear the rush of blood in my ears as i process her words, but still i am unable to believe it. \n\ni don't understand what she's saying, how could the gods not exist when one of them is the cause for my transformation? how could they not exist when i have conversed with the moon and the stars themselves? \n\ni'm unsure of what to say to this strange human, the one who believes the gods do not exist even when she is wearing my likeness upon her finger.\n\n\"may you tell me the story of medusa?\" \n\ni imagine that her face lights up, a wide smile adorning her face that causes her nose to crinkle and eyes to squint. it must be true because her voice  is displaying the emotion of joy, how i wish i could look at her face! it has been a long time since i've seen a smile that was from someone who is not my immediate family. \n\n\"would you prefer the long version or...uh....\"\n\nmy head tilts, confused.\n\n\"i don't know the greek word for this...it's kinda like...uh,\" suddenly she speaks in a language i can't understand, her voice hopeful as if she's waiting for me to say something. \n\n\"forgive me but what language was that?\"\n\nher voice turns confused, \"i was speaking english, it's my mother tongue. have you never heard english before?\" \n\ni shake my head, before realizing that she cannot see the movement. embarrased i utter a simple \"no.\" i've never heard of english in the many years i've been here. though sometimes hermes would bring me items of things in different regions, that was if i had enough dracmae for his payment of course. \n\n\"really? well i'll try my best to explain then.\" \n\nanother embarrassing realization occurred to me just then, i am being a bad host, i should've invited her for dinner long ago, before i even started my interrogation. shame fills my cheeks as i realize how dull my manners have gotten and before i can stop myself i grab her wrist and promise to listen to her stories once she has eaten.\n\nthe story of medusa can wait.\n\ni slowly plate the deer stew i had been simmering earlier, worried about what my guest might think, my mother before me taught me manners when i grew up with her, before i was taken to become a priestess. \n\nwhile it is true most priestesses choose to become servants of the gods i was one of the few unwilling, those who were born into slavery or whose husbands had grown tired of them and had them sent away.\n\nthough of course whilst growing up i was once betrothed to a fair prince of crete, whose beauty was said to surpass achilles himself, narcissus i believe his name was, my father being one of the most prestigious nobles in apollonia, but in his arrogance he didn't pay the proper tribute to athena, almost forgetting her entirely with a meager single calf as her sacrifice, and even apollo, patron god of our city was unable to quell her rage, so to appease the goddess my father forced me to become a priestess.\n\nthe memory of getting assigned to polish the statues of the goddess come unbidden in my memory, and i unintentionally squeeze the bread i am getting kore- i mean persephone, to eat her stew with, crumbling the side i am holding, almost dropping the entire loaf.\n\nshame curdles inside of me like spoiled milk and strangles my throat as i choke back the memory of a young girls cries for her mother as a heavy wooden door closes behind her. it was an honor to serve my goddess as long as i did, but bitter resentment throws me occasionally, mainly when i'm stroking chrysaor's hair as he sleeps. \n\nhe looks more like his father then, his brow furrowing as his dreams become more lifelike than his reality that his body occupies.\n\ni have prayed countless times after the incident, for my death, for forgiveness, for a second chance. but my goddess never answered.\n\nbriseis says something, and i realize belatedly that she's feeling around the table, for a spoon perhaps? it's only then i realize that i have been caught up in my mind for too long.\n\nit's time to pay attention to the blind girl at the end of the table.\n\ni watch briseis as she eats, my eyes mainly resting on her slender hands on habit. it's only when i hear a small clatter, of the spoon being dropped unceremoniously into the bowl that i finally force my eyes to lift higher, but not to her face, to her shoulders only. i am not accustomed to looking anyone in the face.\n\ni do not know where to begin with her, i do not know what to make of the human before me, what to expect, what to brace myself for, or what to tell her if she asks questions. \n\ni have not explained anything to anyone in millennia, not about me or my children or the snakes that slither in my hair and snap at each other for fun.\n\ni do not know what to say as she starts speaking, her voice a waterfall crashing over the smoothened rock below, soft, elegant, and graceful. her milk colored eyes lighting up with excitement as she begins the tale of medusa, the girl with snakes in her hair.\n\na bitter lump in my throat forms as i hear her speak about the sea god, the one who has hurt me more than others.  \n\nhe is where my story begins, she is where my story will begin to take a life that is beyond my control, i cannot control my life beyond her words and it is only when she says nothing that the silence breaks over me. i am unable to find the words that will contradict hers, to tell her that what he did to me was not as mutual as she claimed, or that the grey eyed one formed me not from malice or misplaced jealousy but if sorrow and pity.\n\nshe could not turn on her kind so she had no choice but to turn on me. and while the words i wish to say stick like thorns in my throat i am unable to dislodge them. perseus, whoever that may have been in my garden of stone, was unsuccessful in his attempt to free my head permanently from my shoulders, no matter what the myth says.\n\nsome poet must have pitied him and decided to use his tragic death as the basis of his tale, perhaps unable to cope with the idea that a monster like me was still around after so many \"heroes\" have attempted to rid me.\n\nthe dust of the past seemed to have clogged my memory, my dreams becoming fragmented spiderwebs that are unable to let go of the past, in the corner of my eye i see the weathered statue of the last man who had stumbled upon me. his face smoothing out with the dawn of a new era that he will never see. another ghost that will haunt me whenever hades decides that i am finally fit to be one of his subject.\n\na clatter behind me alerts me to pegasus' presence, who flops his head into my lap to listen to the tale persephone has spun from the depths of her memory. he reacts more than i, snorting disdainfully as he hears the gaudyness of my beheading and how he and chrysaor spring out of my blood into the world. i stroke him absentmindedly, not really paying attention to the story unfolding around me, the story of a monster and a valiant hero who bested it. it's only when she she tells another version do i truly pay attention, this one being of a girl turned monster who is unable to find peace with her life, who becomes a symbol of the abused and provides shelter and aid.\n\na girl turned into a monster turned into a god.\n\na girl who is tragic and forgived for the actions she was the root of.\n\na story of how someone can burn the bridges that were laid by her feet and instead forge a path of gold and silver, a path of redemption.\n\nbriseis makes a big show of yawning, covering her mouth a few times before i finally got the hint and shook myself out of the fantasy i was living in.\n\nthe night seemed to stretch out before us, the shadows casting their long flickering fingers onto our skin as the candlelight bobbed in and out of existence with the dwindling oil that covered my torches. briseis's head was constantly drooping treacherously near the table and i made pegasus stay with her while i made her a bed, using an old bed frame i myself had carved out of cypress and an old soft linen stuffed with goose feathers. \n\ni tested it out to find that the quills constantly stabbed through the fabric, and decided to gather the various pelts i kept around for the winter to lay it on top, satisfied when i tested it again and found it to be soft.\n\nhurrying towards briseis again i announced that it was time for bed, she nodded sleepily and pegasus took it upon himself to guide her to bed, making sure to steady her when heavy clad feet tripped on cracks in the floor or on the odd stool. \n\nonce she was safely into bed i began to clean, keeping as quiet as possible as i took the plates to the stream near my home to rinse them. the moon shown brightly down on me and lit up the field  and stream around me, turning the water a brilliant silver. \n\nhumming a song to myself i made my way back inside and put out the torches, smiling to myself when i saw that pegasus was sleeping next to my bed, his gold wing underneath his head while his silver one covered his face, trying to block out the light i presume. i allowed myself to undress and to put out the last torch as sleep took over my body.\n\ni am bathing in a pool of water, the moon high above me soaking into the dark water below, turning the smooth rocks and coarse sand into fine silvery wisps as i lift my feet to swim a bit further out.\n\nmy long auburn ringlets flow into the dark water, looking like the red tendrils of an octopus. the trees rustle in the breeze as i feel myself sink into the water, my pale skin flashing in the moonlight like a fish's scales, i rise swiftly when i hear a voice call out, covering myself as little as my hands can before the voice's owner comes into view, a few nymphs have emerged from the trees and with them their mistress, artemis. \n\nfear shoots through me as i try to slip out of the water to avoid being seen, i'm not supposed to be out of the temple. but before i can slide into the trees the nymph calls out again. i turn to look at them when i notice that artemis has disrobed and has stepped into the pool i have been occupying. \n\ni avert my eyes dutifully and stay where i am. i hear her approaching slowly, her movements calm and slow as if she is trying to get close to a skittish animal. with my eyes averted i see her feet as she comes to a stop in front of me, to my surprise they're dirty, with the nails slightly overgrown.\n\ni freeze completely when a soft hand tilts my head up, and no matter how mortal her body may seem there is no doubt in my mind that she is a god. her eyes are pale silver and her face has this otherworldly beauty that would put helen to shame, her hair as dark as ink and when she blinks i can see a crescent moon adorning each eyelid, as well as the middle of her forehead, a silvery sheen that glimmers in the shifting moonlight.\n\nshe takes my hand into hers and leads me to the group of awaiting nymphs where they all have begun bathing together, once we reenter the group they seem to loosen up, beginning to laugh and splash each other as the dark droplets turned silver against the brightening moonlight. \n\none of the nymphs move towards the shore to pick berries from a nearby bush, the dark fruit plump and juicy between her fingers as she tosses it into the goddess's mouth, who catches it laughing, another moves towards a tree to hang up her chiton, when she rushes back into the water screaming. \n\ninstantly the others surround the goddess whilst trying to cover their own selves from the figure who suddenly appears from the trees. a hunter who can't take his eyes off the goddess beside me as he hurriedly disrobes and tries to enter the water to reach her. i avert my eyes from were they were starting to go down the man's torso, it is forbidden for me to look at a man in such way, priestesses of athena must remain pure.\n\nthe man comes closer and the nymphs press against each other for comfort, snarling like the wolves who often accompany them, trying to keep the man from touching their goddess, who has gone silent the closer the man has gotten. i steal a glance at her and am surprised to see how clearly she wears the rage on her face. she is fierce and beautiful as she glides past the nymphs, standing in front of her assailant who instantly reaches out to touch her most intimate parts. \n\na hush falls around the nymphs as the man's hand reaches out to squeeze the goddess's breasts, but as soon as his hand lands on her tender skin her hand shoots out to slap him. he curses in frustration and brings his own hand down to strike her, only to grab his head as he seemingly doubles over in pain.\n\nthe nymphs surrounding me laugh as he begins to stumble around the water blindly, holding his head in what seems to be agony as the goddess watches him unamused.\n\ni can only watch in mute horror as two antlers sprout from his forehead, his dark skin turning into muted brown fur as his fingers break off like glass shards as he thrashes around trying to get away, only to have the stump of his hand turn into shiny cleaved black hooves.\n\nthe stag before me bleats in fear as it tries to swim to shore but the nymphs sing out a song that causes a wolf to answer, and soon another answers it's call and then another and another. one by one they appear, and the stag has no choice but to meet them on the shore, it's unsteady hooves try to get sure footing among the small rocks but as soon as it's fully out of the water the wolves descend on it.\n\nthey surround the stag completely, and even though i know what's going to come next i still cannot allow myself to turn away. i watch as one of the wolves trip up the stag by running under its hooves, and another bite into it's hindquarters savagely, ripping away the thin fur to reveal the strong muscle underneath, they begin to tear bits of him off and though the stag tries to fight them off it is no use, a wolf steps onto his head and rips out his throat, a spray of blood misting the air surrounding him, i listen to the last terrified bleats it releases before it's cries become nothing but a gurgle of blood that's pouring out of it's throat.\n\nthe nymphs resume their bath but i am frozen to the spot i occupy, even the goddess barely spares a glance at the carnage before her as she joins the rest of her nymphs to finish bathing. \n\nthe wolves eat the carcass as the nymphs play in the water and i stare at them dumbly, slightly scared to go near them. \n\nthe goddess is done bathing first and as soon as she leaves the nymphs follow and to my surprise one of the grabs my hand and attempts to get me to leave with their group, but i draw back my hand and shake my head firmly, the goddess looks back to me and a sad expression fills her eyes before she leaves my line of sight, leaving me alone once again.\n\ni hurriedly dress and run back to the temple, hoping no one has noticed my absence.\n\ni awake with a start my eyes flying open to meet green ones, chrysaor has been shaking me, his sword in hand, and with hushed tones he speaks of an intruder who has somehow broken in.\n\ni get up quickly, not bothering to cover up my body as my snakes are the last to wake up fully, tasting the air almost lazily as they look for the intruder. with chrysaor behind me i find her. persephone has bundled herself in the old blanket i've given her so only the top of her brown hair could be seen.\n\nchrysaor nudges me and motions to her, trying to tell me that the intruder is the girl sleeping peacefully. i quickly drag him outside to avoid waking her. as soon as we enter the clearing chrysaor plants his feet and crosses his arms, demanding answers.\n\n\"she is a guest in our home and you will not harass her with your sword so put that away!\" i hiss, worried that we might be waking her, above us, on the lip of the cave we inhabit pegasus strolls out and stretches almost like a cat, his wings flashing like coins in the morning sun. \n\n\"why was i not notified then?\" he demands, an annoyed scowl pressing across his face, and for a moment it is like i am looking at his father. \n\ni shake my head to get rid of the ghost that haunts me before i can bring myself to answer.\n\n\"you were asleep, and i was hoping that your brother would have notified you,\" i glare up at where he is trotting down to greet us, his wings ruffling at the sight of me.\n\nas soon as he's near i lightly flick his ear which causes him to snort. i lightly stroke his mane before pressing a kiss on his soft head in greeting.\n\n\"i thought she was trying to hurt us,\" chrysaor mutters, the annoyed expression still plastered on his face. \n\n\"hey,\" i step closer to him and wrap him in my arms, placing a kiss in his dark hair as he sighs against me, \"i did not mean to worry you, i am sorry.\"\n\nwith another sigh he presses into me, before wrapping his arms around me and burying his face into my chest as my snakes hum contentedly.\n\ni'll have to make it up to him somehow, i know he sees it as his duty to protext us as we do not have a family member who will and he tries his hardest to fill that role, but he is still a young boy, all too eager to grow up.\n\ni pull back from the embrace when i hear his stomach growl and stifle a laugh as he blushes embarrasedly, with that i go over to where the oven is and light a fire using flint and stone.\n\nas it heats up i ask the boys to watch over our guest as i get dressed with a simple tunic and grab my bow from the mouth of the cave and head into the dense underbrush below us.\n\nit is not long before i sight the rabbit, and with one well aimed arrow to the throat it is dead. i skin it quickly, trying to flay it as chrysaor likes, removing its organs as i try to find the tree I'm looking for.\n\nup above me i spot it, hearing the distinct humming sound enacting from the hive where the bees live, and with a heavy sigh i leave my rabbit on the top of a high rock, notching another arrow to shoot down the hive. it plummets and cracks open like an overripe pomegranate and i work quickly to grab a few sticky combs before the bees figure out what it was that attacked them.\n\na few stings come my way but i try to ignore them and leave as fast as possible, storing the combs in a small container i had the hindsight to bring with me. picking up the remains of the rabbit before i go i practically run from the broken hive before the rest of the bees have the sense to go after me.\n\nbefore i could head home however i needed to make one more stop, trying to find where the heavy fruit lay among the tall trees, they had to be ripe enough now. \n\ni find the fig tree with some difficulty, going past it twice before i realized that i was stepping on some overripe fruit that has fallen. i set down the rabbit again and bring the container holding the honey comb with me as i climb nearly halfway up the tree trying to pick out the ripest fruit that has yet to fall.\n\nas soon as i gather all that i can i head down again and make my way back to home. before i check if the oven is hot enough i make sure to clean the rabbit properly, removing most of the fat, some of which i place in a container for safe keep and the rest i place in the fourno to liquefy it as i throw in some herbs. \n\ni check on briseis who is still sleeping as i grab the soft dough that i have been making for a few days now and knead it with some of the honey that has gathered at the bottom of the container, deciding to slice up one of the more overripe figs and press it into the dough as well.\n\nas soon as the fruit and honey are incorporated into the dark barley dough i place it in the oven with the herbs, covering it with the dome as i get to work seasoning the rabbit with marjoram, peppercorns that i chop crudely with a knife, and fennel, slicing a bit of another honeycomb to stuff it into the cavity of the creature.\n\nas soon as the bread is done cooking i place the meat into the same bowl the bread once occupied, stepping back as the fat spits up at the new addition. \n\nbehind me i hear chrysaor tell briseis where to go to the bathroom, and once understanding that she cannot see offers to take her there. they emerge from the cave where chrysaor is holding onto briseis's arm tightly as he navigates the safest path downwards, calling out a greeting when he spots me. \n\ni smile back and greet our guest by name as they pass me, and i see the question in chrysaor's eyes as he leads her to the stream outside our home. he'saware of the tragedy her name holds, and i do not know how to explain it to him yet.\n\nsoon enough the rabbit is done cooking and i put it on a platter alongside the still warm bread, setting up the table with the utensils and plates before i go back to fetch the honeycomb.\n\nsurprisingly i bump into chrysaor who explains that he forgot to give persephone the soap so she can wash her hands.\n\n\"she was appalled to have to use the stream.\"\n\n\"she has no choice but to get used to it. now hurry back the food will get cold.\"\n\ni slice off a large hunk of the bread, drizzling it with honey and a piece of fig before handing it to pegasus who doesn't eat meat.\n\nas i start to serve the others their portions i instruct chrysaor to give eurydice her plate before settling down himself, briseis is standing awkwardly behind him and i grab her hand to make sure she's properly seated, drizzling her bread piece with honey and figs as well.\n\nas soon as chrysaor returns we begin to eat and he smiles with delight when he sees the figs on the table and the bread. taking a large chunk of honeycomb and splitting it with his brother. \n\ni sit back slight as i eat, enjoying the warm rabbit and bread as i watch my sons and briseis eat, who all say thank you when they've finished.\n\nall in all it was a good morning.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"25480942\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"yes\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\":

{"work_id": 47019253, "full_story": "Heracles unbinds Prometheus and talks with him.\n\nI had a dream. I was removed from the crag and was lying on the ground in a curled position, feeling some pleasant warmth on my face and stomach. But a part of me was still awake and conscious, and knew it was just a dream. Maybe the warmth was real, from the sun, though if so, it was unusually strong for such an early spring. But the changed position was an illusion, and I knew that if I tried to move my body or any limb, the chains would cut into my wounds and would add new sharp pain to the background pain that was always with me. Strangely, the background pain had changed its pattern. It had subsided where I felt it in recent times, and instead had reappeared in my hand and feet that had become numb decades ago.\n\nThen I smelled smoke, smoke of raw wood. This made me open my eyes. I saw that I was indeed lying on the ground on my left side, and a fire of juniper branches was burning - and smoking - in front of me. More junipers were growing around. What a strange hallucination! I looked at my body. It was covered by a blanket. My arms were curled rather than stretched, and the chains were attached to the wrists but their other ends were lying on the ground. Nothing made any sense, yet it looked and felt increasingly real. It seemed I was truly free after all, though it defied explanation.\n\nAnd then someone came, carrying more juniper branches. Heracles! I finally understood. He had returned and rescued me. And because there was no one else in sight, he had most likely done it of his own accord, notwithstanding the will of Zeus.\n\nHe left his load on the ground and added two of the branches to the fire. I called his name and he turned to me.\n\n'You are awake, hurrah!' he rejoiced. 'I feared you could never wake up.'\n\n'You took me down from the crag?'\n\n'Exactly. I hid and waited until Hermes cleared the terrain, then climbed back and finished the job.' He added with pride, 'I hate doing things halfway.'\n\n'Immense thanks but... You shouldn't have done it. You took too great a risk.'\n\n'Come what may. Nobody needs me anymore, and nobody will weep for me anyway.' After a moment, he corrected himself: 'Only my old mother.'\n\nThen I realized something that hit me like a heavy object.\n\n'Heracles!' I appealed. 'You must return to the crag and bring a piece of it, now! Because Zeus has sworn to keep me chained to it. If he breaks his oath, he will suffer terribly, and will punish you terribly.'\n\n'So we need a piece of that crag here next to you, to pretend you are still on it?'\n\n'Yes!'\n\n'Relax, then! We have it.' Heracles poked into his backpack and brough out a piece of rock. From this angle, it vaguely resembled the hand axes of the Ants. 'I took it because it brought me luck.'\n\n'It really did,' I agreed with a sigh of relief.\n\n'I first tried to pull the chains out of the rock but they didn't even shake. Then I took a hammer that I had brought for this purpose, and tried to break them. But the hammer slipped out of my hand and fell down into the precipice. It was impossible to retrieve it, so I broke this piece from the rock to use it instead. Only then did I see that in each chain, one link was yellowish. I hit on these links, and each of them shattered after the first stroke. But I was afraid when you didn't even wake up. I feared that I'd come too late.'\n\n'So you brought me to - where are we?'\n\n'Somewhere in the mountain, that's all I can say. I walked down the path I came for about three hours, to reach the juniper shrubbery so I could kindle a fire and build a shelter for the night.'\n\nRelaxed, I looked at the snow covering the ground outside the warm circle around the fire.\n\n'Could you please melt a little snow?' I asked. 'Or just put some into my mouth? I'm thirsty.'\n\n'You drink water?' Heracles was surprised. 'I thought you drink only nectar, and eat ambrosia.'\n\n'We eat and drink like you. That's why I divided the ox.'\n\nHe brought to my mouth a small pot full of water which tasted like melted snow. After I drank, he said:\n\n'Do you want to eat? I have bread.'\n\n'Yes, please!'\n\n'I also have olives but I am not sure you should eat them. They are a heavy food.'\n\n'You are right but may I see them? I've never seen olives. They appeared after I was bound here.'\n\n'Here they are. Look, these ones are still on twigs with leaves. And here is the bread.' Heracles brought out a piece, broke it into morsels and put one into my mouth. He said:\n\n'I see that you've had nothing to eat and drink for a long time.'\n\n'The Erinyes came and brought me food and water but it was never enough.'\n\n'The Erinyes? It's good that they fed you but... they aren't a good company, are they?'\n\n'No, they aren't.'\n\n'They come also to me when I unintentionally kill someone... to torment me. But I tell them, if they can return the dead to life, they are welcome, if not, to go away.'\n\nHe fed me a little more bread. Its taste awakened old memories and I shared them:\n\n'We sowed barley with my human friends once but then the flood destroyed it. How have you obtained it after the flood?'\n\n'Demeter gave it to Triptolemus of Eleusis.'\n\n'I am glad that other gods also help the humans now. Back then, nobody approved my deed. Many begged Zeus to relent and punish me less severely. But nobody disputed that I deserved a punishment because I had bestowed honors upon mortal creatures beyond their due. Such were the times... Even the gods barely remember them, and for the humans, it must be forgotten prehistory. But for me, it was like yesterday, because then I was bound here, and my real life was over...'\n\nI stopped talking, ashamed of complaining so much. Heracles said:\n\n'I cut off your hair and beard, for they were hopeless. I saw a wound on the back of your head but it's not deep - apparently not from the bird's beak.'\n\n'I banged my head into the rock,' I admitted.\n\n'You tried to kill yourself?'\n\n'No, just couldn't help doing it when the bird...'\n\n'Well, it's over. Do you think they will check on you and find out that you are gone?'\n\nI considered the question and the more I thought of it, the less likely it seemed that Zeus would really let me alone in eternal sleep.\n\n'I think they will,' I said. 'I think that Zeus will be unhappy that Hermes has botched the negotiations, and will try again. Let's think what you'll say when they return.'\n\n'Well, the way they were treating you, immortality or not, you would very soon be unable to negotiate, so they should be thankful to me. And with this fire, it's not like we are hiding. But I think you must say that damned secret.'\n\n'I don't know,' I admitted.\n\n'Why? Are you worrying about Chiron? Believe me, he suffers unbearably and longs for death. He would have already stopped eating ambrosia but he still has some pupils and wants to complete teaching them.'\n\n'I don't want to uphold Zeus' power... after all he did, and all he can do.'\n\n'What exactly can he do?'\n\n'I wish I knew!'\n\n'You talked about me as if you knew everything that has happened and will happen. But now you say that you don't know what Zeus intends.'\n\n'I know some things from the past and future but not all. In fact, very little. Tell me about yourself!'\n\n'I was born in Thebes, the city with the seven-gated fortress...'\n\n'What is a city?' I asked, leaving \"fortress\" aside. I was sure that these were not words that I had forgotten but rather words I had never known.\n\n'A large settlement. How was it called back in your time?'\n\n'At my time, there were no such things. Sorry that I interrupted you.'\n\n'I had to become king of Mycenae but Hera made my aunt give birth prematurely, so my cousin Eurystheus was born before me and became king...'\n\n'I think she did you a favor. Being a king is dirty work.'\n\n'But it was my birthright! And she has harmed me more. When I was eight months old, she put two large snakes into my cradle to strangulate me, but I killed them instead. I am very strong. But I cannot control myself, and I don't think very well. As I told you, I never learned reading and writing. As a boy, I had a tutor for some time. But I got angry at him, unwittingly hit him on the head too hard and killed him. Then no one wanted to teach me. When I grew up, I did a favor to Creon the ruler of Thebes, and he gave me his daughter Megara to be my wife. She bore me three wonderful sons. And then great misfortune struck me...'\n\nHeracles made a pause and swallowed several times before continuing:\n\n'Because Hera with her intrigues had made my cousin Eurystheus king, I had to serve him. But he is a good-for-nothing scoundrel. You cannot imagine how I felt!'\n\nI could imagine it very well but said nothing because I didn't want to interrupt him again.\n\n'He hadn't sought me for years and I hoped that he didn't need me anymore and would leave me alone. But I was wrong. Exactly when I had finally managed my own life and was happy, he sent me a message to report to him so that he would give me tasks. Then madness overwhelmed me... It seemed to me that my eldest nephew Iolaus was Eurystheus, and his two younger brothers... and my own children... were his sons. And I rushed to kill them... Iolaus escaped but I killed the five children... Have you any loved ones - a wife, relatives?'\n\n'I had. I had a wife, three brothers, parents. I had also a son and a daughter but they were mortal, and died long ago.'\n\n'But the others aren't mortal, are they? Why do you talk as if they are also dead?'\n\n'Hermes said that they have written me off. But I am not sure now that this is entirely true. I know it's true about my eldest brother Atlas. Maybe about my youngest brother as well. But I wonder why Hermes and the Erinyes didn't tell me earlier. They are always happy to bring me bad tidings.'\n\n'So Hermes told you that your loved ones no longer love you, and you decided to sleep. I felt the same when I came back to my senses. Do you remember what Hermes said - that mad people should not live? I also thought that it's better for those like me to die. I intended to kill myself but my friend Theseus stopped me. He told me that Hera has most likely afflicted me with madness...'\n\n'Yes, she has, and also Zeus before her.'\n\n'My father? But why?'\n\n'I mean you have inherited dangerous things from him. Look at me - would he do such things if he were sane? And some of his sons skin or tear apart alive people they don't like. Good that Theseus happened to be there. What happened then?'\n\n'I consulted the Oracle of Delphi. The priestess told me to go to Eurystheus and offer him my services, and he'd order me to perform ten Labors to atone for my deed. Since then, I've been busy with these tasks. I have in fact already performed ten Labors but he dismissed two of them. He had sent me to kill a monster called Hydra. It was lurking near the city of Lerna and eating the travelers. It had nine heads, eight mortal and one immortal in the middle. I started removing them but as soon as I chopped one off, two new ones grew in its place. I called Iolaus to help me and while I was cutting the heads, he burned their places so that they wouldn't grow anymore. So we killed the Lernaean Hydra, except its immortal head which we couldn't kill and I buried it deep under a crag. But when I returned, Eurystheus said that he wouldn't count this Labor because Iolaus had helped me. The other one he didn't count was the cleaning up of king Augeas' stables because I had received payment for it. That's why I still have two Labors left: the one in Hesperia and the one that you say will be in Hades, and they will be twelve totally. After I killed the Hydra, I immersed my arrows in its poisonous bloud. Since then, everybody pierced by these arrows dies in extreme pain. This is how I unfortunately injured my friend Chiron. I was aiming at another centaur but hit him. He has suffered ever since but as long as he eats ambrosia, he will not die.'\n\n'Let me repeat: in such an accident, immediately immerse the injured body part in hot water. Remember this!' I said. I had a foreboding that such an accident would happen to Heracles himself.\n\n'Between the Labors, I do some other things,' he continued. 'Upon returning from the tenth Labor, I was invited to an expedition to Colchis to seek a golden fleece. We were fifty, and sailed on a ship named Argo. We crossed the Euxine.' Heracles said \"Euxine\" quite clearly and confidently, so I realized that the name of the sea had changed. 'When we were already close to Colchis, we disembarked on the shore. One of us got lost, and we made a search party but never found him. His name was Hylas, and he was a very good friend of mine. I suppose that the poor one has fallen and died somewhere in the wilderness.'\n\n'The water nymphs have liked him and lured him,' I chimed in. I preferred not to reveal that they had unintentionally drowned him.\n\n'I hope he is well,' replied Heracles, apparently doubting it. 'After searching long in vain, I despaired. At that moment, Iris appeared to me. It was like a dream but was no dream. She smiled and was very polite. She told me to give up everything else and go rescue you from the eagle. So I left my companions and came here. I wandered for a long time, for the Caucasus is a wilderness without tracks. I wished I had a flying device like that which Daedalus built to escape from Crete. Though maybe it was better that I hadn't, because his son Icarus fell and died. It was exactly me who found and buried the body, and it was horrible to behold...'\n\nI was stunned. I supposed that the flying device constructed by Daedalus had been engineless but it was still hard to believe that the humans who hadn't yet mastered the iron were already trying to travel by air.\n\n'When I would lose myself totally, someone left signs for me,' said Heracles. 'Nevertheless, I already feared that I wouldn't find you and would just wander until I'd run out of food and die. However, two days ago at dawn, I heard someone cry - was this you?'\n\n'Yes, it was me. I tried to endure in silence but couldn't.'\n\n'And it was good that you couldn't, because I heard you and finally found you. I'd shoot that disgusting bird even if they hadn't told me. I wouldn't stand by and watch it eat you alive. Then I considered my job done, and intended to leave. But as I turned my back, I realized that Hermes had not actually promised me that they'd set you free from your bonds, and I was afraid for you. So I hid and then returned to rescue you. Now, I have my peace of mind, and this is most important. Besides, as I said, I have no children to support anymore. I have only Megara. She forgave me but I have the feeling that she'd be happier without me. She is now living in Tiryns, where my mother is from, and I visit her whenever I can. We had to leave Thebes, of course.'\n\nI had a feeling now that Heracles would get away with releasing me, and I voiced it:\n\n'Methinks you have nothing to be afraid of now. And generally you can cope with almost any difficulty coming from without. The real perils for you are the fits of rage and madness coming from within. They cost the life of whoever happens to be around, guilty or not. Why did you want to kill Eurystheus' children? You must learn to control yourself. Count to fifty before raising your hand against someone!'\n\nAs I expected, Heracles didn't like my words. Rage distorted his face, and he raised his right hand as if to hit me.\n\n'This is exactly what I mean,' I added. Heracles slowly pulled his hand down.\n\n'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I can't control myself. This is the curse of my life.'\n\n'It's all right, but be careful not to kill anymore. And as I already said, part ways with Megara! She has forgiven you but you mustn't live together anymore. No marriage can survive what happened.'\n\n'But how can I leave her alone and without protection?'\n\n'Don't leave her alone, give her as wife to someone trustworthy! I think Iolaus is the best. He is good-hearted, and they'll love each other.'\n\n \n\nHeracles added juniper branches into the fire and asked:\n\n'Now, if you aren't too exhausted, would you tell me your story? Why did you and my father become enemies? How did you decide to give us fire? And is it true that you have created the humans?'\n\nI remained silent for a moment to collect my thoughts, wondering where to begin. Then I began my tale at random:\n\n'This was the third human generation. Athena, Hephaestus and I created it, following your father's order. Otherwise, none of us would think of it, let alone dare do it. Zeus was far-sighted. He had figured out that sentient mortal beings, similar to us, were needed. But when we created them, he didn't like them. He wanted to bring the whole race to an end and create a new one in its place, more to his liking. I disagreed. You asked why we became enemies. After all, I supported him in his revolt against Cronus. I stood against most of my family...'\n\n'You mean the War of the Titans?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'I have wondered why after it, Zeus imprisoned the other titans but left you free. Why did you side with him?'\n\n'Because of stupidity. I was young and thought that if we topple to old tyrant, everything would be fine. However, once enthroned, Zeus started doing things I found wrong. I objected, and we started to dislike each other. But we truly quarreled over the humans. I befriended some of them. And my son would be like them. But they had nothing, and Zeus wanted them never to have anything. You talk about cities, ships and flying devices. The humans of my time had only dreams of food, warmth and shelter. We met with their chiefs at a place named Mecone - do you know it?'\n\n'In Peloponnese, close to the isthmus?' asked Heracles.\n\n'Yes, it was close to the isthmus,' I confirmed, though I had never before heard the name Peloponnese.\n\n'I have heard that this is the old name of the place where today is the city of Sicyon.'\n\n'At Mecone, Zeus ordered me to show how to do a sacrifice. I made a trick so that the meat remained for the humans, and the gods ended up with the bones. We actually had our own flocks and didn't need the human ones. However, your father got quite angry, and forbade us to give fire to the humans. I gave them whatever else I could but without fire, nothing was of much use. The winter was disastrous for them, their children were dying of cold. And when Zeus forbade me to meet them anymore, I went for one last time and showed them how to kindle fire by friction...'\n\n'Really? Our tradition says that you have stolen a firebrand from Zeus' hearth, or from Hephaestus' forge, or from Helios' chariot.'\n\n'Nonsense! I had my own hearth but why carry around firebrands so that everyone would see me? And I had to learn the humans to kindle fire themselves anyway. Your father considered the fire his property, like everything else. That's why he said I had stolen it. However, I thought that the fire belongs to everyone. And I still think so.'\n\n'Some say that my father actually wanted you to give us fire.'\n\n'They may well be right. But his intention wasn't good. I think he set a trap for me, and I stepped into it and dragged the humans as well. Your father was seeking an excuse to deal with them and with me, and I gave him one. At my trial, he said: \"Son of Iapetus, surpassing all in cunning, you are glad that you have outwitted me and stolen fire - a great plague to you yourself and to men that shall be. But I will give men as the price for fire an evil thing, their own destruction.\" And he laughed. Yes, he laughed. I had foreseen my fate but too late did I see what he'd do to the humans. Do you know what happened then? Have you heard of Pandora and her... box?' I couldn't remember the word \"jar\".\n\n'I know nothing about the box but have heard of Pandora. That she was the first mortal woman, sent to the human race as a punishment. Was it truly so? It makes Megara angry that just because Pandora was bad, all women are blamed.'\n\n'She wasn't bad, just curious. And she wasn't the first mortal woman. Zeus decided to use my feeble-minded brother Epimetheus to hurt the humans. He made the Olympians adorn Pandora, placed a jar full of contagious diseases into her hands, and sent her to become my brother's wife. I had warned him to accept nothing from Zeus, but he had no sense. So women are blamed just because I happened to have a feeble-minded brother rather than a sister.'\n\n'But people also say that Pandora gave us hope,' remarked Heracles.\n\n'It's true. She gave birth to Pyrrha, and I don't think Deucalion would have coped without Pyrrha. But before hope, Pandora gave diseases - because she opened the box, of course. So outbreaks afflicted the humans, and their numbers plummeted. But some withstood the diseases. Zeus saw that he wouldn't get rid of mankind so easily, and made a flood. This was thirty years after the so-called theft of fire...'\n\n'I have heard that he ordered the flood because humans succumbed to evil.'\n\n'They say so to whitewash Zeus. In fact, he had decided to destroy the humans, be they good and bad. But it's true that after Pandora's box, many were ruined inside and resorted to evil. They would blame some unfortunate man for bringing disease, and kill him on the spot. But the worst thing was that they stopped worshipping the gods. As a result, most gods agreed with Zeus that this generation of humans had to be wiped out from the face of the Earth and be replaced with another, allegedly better. A crazy chief named Lycaon tipped the balance. He sacrificed a boy to Zeus, thinking - with some logic - that Olympians wanted human sacrifices. Your father used this as an excuse to flood the lands populated by humans. Only my son Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha survived. I had warned them about the flood, and they built a chest. They were offspring of gods, so Zeus didn't dare to kill them...'\n\n'You mean Deucalion who survived the flood, wanted new humans and became ruler of Thessaly! I have heard of him of course but I didn't know he was your son.'\n\n'My descendants leave out this awkward detail,' I admitted. 'They prefer to point out that they derive from Zeus, which is also true because he raped Pyrrha and her daughters and begat children with them. Anyway, mankind had a new start, and most diseases brought by Pandora disappeared with the flood - at least for the time being. But back then, I couldn't find anything positive. I regretted my deeds, because however wretched the life of humans in the Stone Age was, my intervention brought their demise.'\n\n'Did you tell anyone of your regret?'\n\n'No, I didn't.' Heracles smiled, satisfied. 'You are the first to hear about it. But I said a lot of other things. Most importantly, I uttered the prophecy that a particular woman, if raped by Zeus, would give birth to a son stronger than him. But I haven't said her name to this day, and I don't intend to.'\n\n'I think that you must.'\n\n'Heracles, your father killed off my friends, tortured me until I turned into a shadow of my former self, and made the pettiest revenge possible by raping my daughter in-law and my granddaughters! And you say I must give him what he wants?'\n\n'About the latter, I don't even think it was revenge,' said Heracles. 'It seems that my father rapes anything that moves. No one of my family has ever rebelled against him, yet he forced himself on my mother Alcmene, and this is how I was conceived. People say that he is very good, but I am a living proof that he isn't, for if he was, I wouldn't exist at all! Unless we say that whatever he does is good, but this makes no sense.'\n\n'Excellent argument!' I admitted. 'But please don't say it to others.'\n\n'I won't.'\n\n'And don't pursue one woman after another like him. He can do whatever he wants because he makes others pay for his mistakes. But if you do the same, you'll suffer terribly, and will die early. So let me repeat, it's the best for you not to marry again, but if you really need a woman, choose one and be loyal to her.'\n\n'I'd wish to do so, but as I said, I cannot control myself. I take after my father in this. So I'll follow my fate. I am doomed to die anyway. I am not immortal, no matter how much I wish to be. I have heard that my father has grabbed some boy from Phrygia, made him his cupbearer and given him immortality, but he has no intention to bestow the same gift on me, his own son.'\n\nI had a reasonable guess that the Phrygian boy was wanted for services other than cupbearing, which Heracles couldn't perform exactly because he was Zeus' son. I didn't voice it, just asked:\n\n'Do you wish to be immortal?'\n\n'Of course I do! I know it's impossible but I still wish it. And though I suffered greatly after I killed my sons and nephews, I am glad that Theseus didn't let me die. I can challenge death, and I have done it many times, but I still think nothing is worse than it!'\n\nI just nodded, though I knew that worse than death was wishing for it in vain. Heracles returned to the previous subject:\n\n'And I fear that if you don't reveal the secret, this would mean death for many of us. Because, when the stronger son comes, the first thing he'll do will be a big war in our lands. And then, if any humans have remained, he may wish to clear them. My father for all his faults has already put up with the existence of humans.'\n\n'You are right here,' I admitted, 'though Zeus still kindles stupid wars among humans.'\n\n'It seems that his power has diminished,' coucluded Heracles and asked a surprising question: 'Do you know if he's still Thunderer?'\n\n'What makes you doubt it?'\n\n'I have a friend named Admetus, he rules over Pherae. Do you know what happened to him?'\n\n'No, I don't, please tell me!'\n\n'Admetus had as a servant Apollo himself for an entire year! But let me begin from the beginning. Some time ago, Apollo fell in love with a mortal woman named Coronis, and begat a child. But she cheated on him because she didn't love him, she loved a man. Apollo found out and shot her, or sent Artemis to shoot her - I am not sure what exactly happened. Anyway, Coronis was killed, together with many poor people who just happened to be nearby...'\n\n'Typical.'\n\n'And she was about to give birth. Apollo cut her womb open and brought out his son alive. He named him Asclepius and gave him to Chiron for upbringing. Apollo hoped that his son would befriend gods and be given immortality. Instead, Asclepius wished to help humans. He became a great healer, some say better than his father. He cured many who were considered doomed. But once he brought back to life a man hit by Zeus' thunderbolt, and my father got angry. He killed the man again, and then killed Asclepius with another thunderbolt. Apollo was enraged, and avenged his son by shooting the Cyclopes who had forged the thunderbolt. Zeus relented and revived Asclepius but ordered Apollo to become a mortal's servant for a year as a punishment. This is why he had to serve Admetus. When I heard of this, I thought that with the Cyclopes dead, there would be no more thunderbolts. However, they didn't even diminish.'\n\nWhat news! It was good that I was lying, for I felt my world turning upside down. And Heracles was relating it quite an everyday manner - apparently his imagination wasn't too lively. I could now understand why my mention of Leto had enraged Hermes so much.\n\n'The thunderbolt was both a weapon and a natural phenomenon,' I explained. 'The natural phenomenon will remain. However, only the Cyclopes knew how to make the weapon, so it will come to an end. However, don't tell the humans about it! They will grow overconfident, and Zeus may still be Thunderer for some time because he is likely to have dozens of stored thunderbolts. Moreover, he has other weapons as well.'\n\n'But he is going to lose this particular weapon sooner or later, isn't he?'\n\n'If the Cyclopes are truly dead, then yes, he is.'\n\n'Then I suppose that, knowing that he won't be as dangerous anymore, you can accept his power and have your life back.'\n\n'Not much has remained of it...'\n\n'Whatever has remained. So tell that damn secret! You'll do a favor to yourself and everyone else. Including the lady. Whoever she is, I don't think she'd want my father in her bed. My mother didn't.'\n\n'Yes, she definitely wouldn't want him.'\n\n'So reveal it! Just take care that my father doesn't deceive you. Don't rely on his mercy!'\n\n'Of course I won't. I know Zeus' mercy. Its key quality is its absence.'\n\nI felt that Hermes would return any moment, and told Heracles about it:\n\n'Please add green branches to the fire to produce smoke. Hermes will soon come, and will wonder where I am.'\n\n'I wish I hadn't to deliver you to my father, and return to serve that wretch Eurystheus.'\n\n'Once I am out of here, I'll be safe. And you do a good job ridding the forests and the see from monsters, the result of irresponsible experiments. Try to look at Eurystheus' funny side. I can see him trembling behind the walls of Mycenae, daring not show his nose...'\n\n'Whenever I bring him something truly interesting, he hides in a large jar.'\n\n'I wish to see him when you bring him Cerberus! Now call Hermes, for he is already circling above the crag and wondering.'\n\nHermes returns and negotiates with Prometheus.\n\nHeracles stood up, waived his hands over his head and cried out:\n\n'Here, here! We are here!' The knife with which he had cut the juniper shone in his right hand. He turned to Prometheus and said in a low voice: 'What a fool I must look like, pointing a knife at the sky!'\n\n'In such cases, we usually hold a knife. Maybe it gives us confidence,' I said.\n\nA dot in the sky started enlarging. It soon turned into a flying cart which landed on the slope. Hermes and Hephaestus stepped out of it and approached.\n\n'So Prometheus talked you into releasing him after all, didn't he?' sneered Hermes to Heracles.\n\n'So what if he's released me?' I asked. 'If the negotiations fail, you'll bind me again.'\n\n'You must stay bound to the crag all the time!'\n\n'I am. The stone next to me is from the crag.'\n\n'Prometheus hasn't talked me into anything,' clarified Heracles. 'When I wrapped him in a cloak, I touched him, and he was cold as a corpse. He was quite unwell, and I didn't think you'd leave him there. But I still checked, and I found you gone and him unconscious. If I hadn't released and warmed him, I doubt he'd be able to speak with you now.'\n\n'I had to bring the cart,' said Hermes. 'Did Prometheus badmouth your father in front of you?'\n\n'He said that it was thanks to my father that humans came to exist,' replied Heracles with resourcefulness that surprised me. Then Hermes turned to me:\n\n'And you, Prometheus, dare not speak of negotiations! This is arrogance. The father of gods and men cannot negotiate with a wretch like you.'\n\n'Oh he can. He wants something from me and I want something from him, so we'll negotiate. This is why you're here after all.'\n\n'Hail Heracles! You've done my job, and done it quite well!' exclaimed Hephaestus joyously. He approached me, bent down and asked:\n\n'Why are you lying, have you broken bones?' and added quietly so that Hermes wouldn't hear him, 'Don't tell the secret until he promises you freedom!'\n\n'I am just injured and exhausted,' I replied and winked to show that I had understood. He was my dear friend as before, and I wouldn't let anything come between us.\n\n'No personal conversations!' Hermes interrupted us and also approached me. 'Father Zeus said that you must first divulge the secret and only then be unbound. But if you are reasonable and don't fall back to your old obstinacy, it won't matter which one has been first. Come on! All I want from you is a name.'\n\n'And what about my conditions?'\n\n'The titans are already free, as Arce has told you.'\n\n'And the humans?'\n\n'Zeus needn't promise anything about the humans. He has changed his attitude to them. He doesn't want anymore to wipe them out and replace them with a better race.'\n\n'This is already impossible anyway,' I pointed out.\n\n'Of course, he removes individual humans.'\n\n'Only individuals?'\n\n'Well, also groups that become too evil or too proud.'\n\n'Only in such cases?'\n\n'Or if they become too numerous,' reluctantly admitted Hermes and cast a quick glance at Heracles to see how the member of the human race felt about this discussion. The hero was admiring the mountain peaks and seemed quite uninterested in the negotiations.\n\n'So be it,' I said. 'Then I only want Zeus to give me back my freedom.'\n\n'Unthinkable! You are a criminal who doesn't deserve freedom, and when you were free, you kept making epic messes. But you'll receive the treatment you need, and you'll be treated well. If you behave well, you may even have visitations from time to time.'\n\n'It had to be so from the beginning. But after everything I endured, now I want freedom. Not to be locked up and the key be thrown away.'\n\n'You cannot demand to walk free around Olympus and disturb the Thunderer! This is simply not serious!'\n\n'If Father Zeus doesn't want Prometheus on Olympus, let him stay with us,' chimed in Heracles. 'I'll bring him to Colchis, it's a barbarian city but is well managed and must have good healers. When he gets better, I can take him home in Tiryns. Or he may settle in Athens. My friend Theseus who rules there wants to increase literacy and meets with open arms anyone who can read.'\n\nHeracles' expression was quite innocent though he would later admit that he was trying to catch Hermes at his word.\n\n'Unthinkable!' shouted Hermes again. 'Prometheus among the humans again, may the Moirae save us from this!' Then he turned to me: 'Have you learned nothing during all these years? If you had admitted your fault and had repented, your lot would have been far better. But no, you want Zeus to release you while still behaving as his enemy.'\n\n'On the contrary, I was very loyal,' I said. 'I revealed right away that the danger would come from a new union. If I hadn't warned him, Zeus would have laid with that maiden long ago, and would fall from his... high chair. But now, to keep his power, it's enough to stick to Hera and all the other ladies he already has, plus the boy he has abducted from Phrygia. As long as he rules over himself, he'll rule over the world...'\n\n'Watch your tongue! And if you don't want new torture, don't mention Ganymede!'\n\n'I'm just describing the situation. Unless Zeus accepts my condition, he won't learn the secret. You know that when I want, I talk free, and when I don't want, nobody can force me. Time passes, and some wonderful day Zeus will be unable to restrain himself. An adversary will he prepare despite himself, a prodigy irresistible, even one who shall discover a flame mightier than the lightning and a deafening crash to outroar the thunder. Then, wrecked upon this evil, Zeus shall learn how different it is to be a sovereign and a slave.'\n\n'Nonsense! The life span of our progeny is ever shortening. Zeus need not fear his son who will not be immortal. He demands the name from you just as a formality and a proof that you have been reformed.'\n\n'Oh yes, his son will not be truly immortal. But our previous succession war lasted only ten years. Even ordinary humans live much longer. So I don't believe that it's just a formality. If so, why does Zeus recently lay only with Hera and mortal women... and with that boy?'\n\nHermes couldn't find an answer. I continued:\n\n'Right now, Zeus seems more eager to keep me here than to learn the secret. But he'll change his mind, and will send you to me again. Today, Heracles barely brought me back to my senses. Next time, I may be unable to tell the name, even if I want to. I lose ever more words. Maybe I won't remember even my own name. And Zeus will blame you. You know that he always blames others for his mistakes.'\n\n'This is nonsense! You are immortal.'\n\n'My liver is immortal but my brain isn't. You said yourself that I am becoming like Epimetheus.'\n\nHermes was lost for words again. Then Hephaestus turned to him:\n\n'Why don't you agree? You know that we all want Prometheus to return. I bet that even you want it. Why don't you promise him freedom on Zeus' behalf?'\n\n'So be it,' Hermes sighed. 'He'll be free within the confines of Olympus.'\n\n'And promise that Zeus won't hurt the maiden!' I added.\n\n'Stop these offensive hints!'\n\n'This is no hint. I remember what happened to Metis!'\n\n'All right. I promise that Zeus won't hurt her.'\n\n'Swear an oath!' I insisted. Hermes reluctantly swore and added:\n\n'But you will not be acquitted. You are just a pardoned criminal, and will wear an ivy wreath in place of your chains, to differ from the rest and to remember your punishment.' Saying this, he took out a wreath.\n\n'I refuse to admit guilt in this way!' I said and turned to Heracles with indignation: 'The inferior ones on Olympus wear ivy leaves, and they want to put an entire wreath on me!'\n\n'Why do you care? It causes no pain, does it?' remarked Heracles. 'If you don't repent in words, others may think whatever they want. And we can bear wreaths in you honor.' Heracles brought out from his bag the olive branches and put them on his head in some crude resemblance of a wreath. Then he took the ivy wreath from Hermes and placed it on my head. This time, I did not object.\n\n'Now, say her name,' said Hermes. However, I stayed silent. I felt that if I said it, something bad would happen, though I didn't yet know what exactly. Anxiety grew until finally Hephaestus spoke:\n\n'Say it at last so that we can go home! Have you grown attached to the Caucasus? If you don't think of yourself, think of Pronoia! She has been inconsolable ever since you were bound here. She became gaunt and her eyes shine no more. Without you, there is no life for her!'\n\nSomething tore inside me. I turned to Hermes and sneered:\n\n'Liar!'\n\n'I haven't lied to you! I only said that Pronoia lives in Hephaestus' home and he has remarried! This is true, and it's no fault of mine if you have misunderstood me.'\n\nHephaestus and Heracles were watching us in dismay. Hermes admitted what it was about. Heracles cast an admonishing look while Hephaestus laughed and explained to me:\n\n'We parted ways with Aphrodite and I married Aglaia, and Pronoia lives with us. This is the truth.' Then he turned to Hermes: 'Aren't you tired of all these lies? You deserve Prometheus to tear off your head! And I'll help him.'\n\n'All right, but let him first say the name.'\n\nI still had the dark foreboding but I wanted to live again, to return to Pronoia. I took a breath and said:\n\n'Thetis.'\n\n'Really?' exclaimed Hermes in disbelief. 'Of all goddesses and nymphs, exactly Thetis! It's hard to believe. Too convenient. Can you swear?'\n\n'I swear by Styx that it's Thetis!'\n\n'So it must be true after all. Father Zeus will be disappointed, for he hasn't given up on Thetis. He intended to take her as soon as you would confirm that it was not her.'\n\n'Let him take her, why not!' Heracles said merrily. 'If he wishes her so much... I'd always prefer a beautiful maiden to a kingdom!'\n\n'It won't get to this. He'll most likely give her as wife to some mortal.'\n\nI immediately realized that, though Thetis herself had proposed this long ago, it was exactly the evil I had foreseen. She had escaped a trouble just to be afflicted by another one, and it was my fault. Alas, it was too late to swallow my words or to set a condition that Thetis does not suffer a forced marriage. I only said:\n\n'No need to.'\n\n'Now that Prometheus has revealed the secret, you'll return him to his wife, won't you? And you'll treat him well?' asked Heracles.\n\n'Yes, we will,' replied Hermes and nodded.\n\n'I am very glad! I knew that we could rely on the mercy and wisdom of Father Zeus! Prometheus cannot walk, may I carry him to your cart?'\n\n'Yes, please! Prometheus, bid your rescuer farewell and let's go,' said Hermes.\n\nHeracles lifted me, carried me to the cart and placed me on the back seat, then handed the stone to Hephaestus. I was so exhausted that couldn't even say farewell. I remember that Hephaestus, who was sitting next to me, was poking me and shouting: \"Don't fall asleep! Apollo said you shouldn't!\" but it was in vain. I fell asleep deeply, or maybe I fainted again.", "LLM_response": "```jsonl { \"work_id\": \"47019253\", \"death_event_1\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"unknown\", \"Victim\": \"Pronoia\", \"Perpetrator\": \"implied loss of life force\"}, \"death_event_2\": {\"Character Death\": \"no\", \"Mode of Demise\": \"forced marriage\", \"Victim\": \"Thetis\", \"Perpetrator\": \"Zeus/Fate\"}} ```"}
