However, their happiness was short-lived as Thunder's son Perseus, aided by Athena herself, beheaded Medusa, killing her. Athena, filled with grief and regret, buried Medusa in their secret garden and vowed never to help any of Thunder's children again.

57137989;"Here is a summary of the provided short story:  Semele, Zeus' mortal lover, demands that he grant her immortality by showing himself to her in his divine form, despite Zeus' warnings that it would be fatal for her. Semele's insistence, fueled by the old crone's (Hera's) manipulation, ultimately leads to her demise as Zeus' divine lightning strikes and burns out her eyes, killing her. The mode of Semele's death is being consumed by Zeus' divine fire. Zeus is both the perpetrator and the unwitting murderer, while Semele is the victim. In his grief, Zeus then performs a gruesome surgery on himself to implant their unborn son into his thigh, ensuring the child's survival and eventual """"twice-born"""" status.""";False positive & false negative;Summary;;manipulation, intercourse, struck by lightning ;divine fire;0;1;1;0;Semele;Semele;1;0;0;0;Zeus;Zeus;1;0;0;0;Partially Correct;Errors in: Mode of Demise (FP or FN) with at least one TP;narrator;third;"""She cried out in climax, but then his divine lightning struck, searing the land for miles around. ~~~ Zeus wept tears as he carried the lifeless body of his lover to a pond where he might wash her and prepare her for her journey across the river he had sworn upon.""";805;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

Eurylochus wanted to scream, to tell him to drop the torch in the water, to hold him down till he followed, but Demetrius got up, dusting himself off flippantly. Eurylochus could still see the slight tremble of his hands. Before he could shout, could do anything, the stupid, brave man walked forward, steering well clear of the huddled groups of men. He waved the fire around, and the sudden focus of the monster on his person was palpable. Demetrius turned and met Eurylochus’ eyes one final time, apologetic, scared, but so obviously relieved too. With tears in his eyes and a grin on his face, Demetrius raised the torch high like a flag, closing his eyes, water trailing down his face, as Scylla dragged him to the depths of the ocean.
