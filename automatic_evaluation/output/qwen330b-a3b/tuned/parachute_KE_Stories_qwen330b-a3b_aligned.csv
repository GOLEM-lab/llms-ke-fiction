17464;"""You watch when Achilles strikes your brother down, watch your brother's glorious form fall under the wrath of a goddess's son, and you can almost hear your brother telling you again that he hates you, that you are the reason he won't live to see the sun set this day.""";narrator;second;Hector;Hector;;;;;Achilles;Achilles;;;;;slaying;killed;;;;;"You cannot sleep. You lie in your extravagant bed alone, you, Alexandros, the fairest man this side of the Aegean Sea. Helen has not touched you in years; she hates you for taking her away from Menelaus. You don't love her, either.  He presses heavily against you, tan fingers digging into your golden thighs, and you can almost see the purple bruises that will appear the next morning. You try to touch him, but he only bats your hands away before clutching your thighs again.  ""I hate you,"" he tells you  You only ever loved him. You never loved Oenone or Helen...only him. You think you should have stuck with one of them, probably Oenone since she loved you, because neither of them are your brother, and that makes all the difference  and you know he doesn't, you know he loves you. Everyone loves you, or loved, anyway, except for Cassandra, and he is no exception. He welcomed you when you first appeared at the palace in your shepherd drags, and even when you brought Helen back and earned yourself disapproval from some, he never did anything but love you and support you.  The only difference with him is that you love him back  because only your brother can hurt you this much. Sometimes, you wish you never fell in love with Hector.  His widow is still in mourning, but you, who love him the most, received your entire share when the funeral games ended. You are the only person left to command the army, and you wish you fought more when Hector was still alive  and you know he knows that as well. He continues.  ""I hate you for foolishly bringing Helen to Ilium just because Aphrodite promised her to you. I hate you for charming me so much that I didn't force you to take Helen back to Sparta so that she won't bring war upon us. I hate you for turning to me when she abandoned you. I hate you for making me love you so that I can't hate you,"" he utters lowly, sliding into you faster and rougher, and you know now that he isn't lying, that he loves you but hates you at the same time.  ""I can't believe I'll die because of you,"" he growls  instead of charming your way out of everything in order to live a life of idleness and luxury. But you still had Helen then, and by the time you lost her, no one came to ask you to fight anymore. They all still loved you, of course, because you are Paris, but Hector was the only one who really cared about you. At least, he was the only one who actually came to you when Helen left you.  And now, you have no one. You don't have Oenone or Helen and especially not the only person you ever loved, and you think that maybe you deserve all this because it is your fault, anyway, that any of this happened. You caused everything, so you really shouldn't be surprised that you would lose in the process as well, even with Aphrodite's protection.  and you arch up into him as he says, ""Because I killed Patroclus, Achilles won't let me live."" With one last thrust, you are coming, and he says then, ""I won't live to see tomorrow night. All because you made me too weak to order the return of Helen,"" and when you finally regain enough senses to open your mouth in protest, he covers it brutally with his own.  He releases you with the taste of blood in your mouth, and he tells you, ""Never again, Paris. You can't charm me anymore."" He turns away from you, and though you reach for him, he doesn't see. He doesn't want to see.  He doesn't turn back, just dresses himself and leaves you by yourself in your bed, and you think that maybe he doesn't know that you love him, after all, that you are in love with him.  You finally manage to sleep a few hours before a servant awakens you, and when you dismiss him, you gaze at the armor laid before you, the armor that you must wear now that your brother is gone. You touch each piece and wonder how your brother felt, sweating under them in the sun, blood staining the shining metal plates.  You put your armor on slowly, and when you finish, you gaze into the mirror and know that you don't fit within the confines of war. Your golden, smooth skin contrasts sharply with the cold hardness of the armor, and you are reminded of the scars and calluses on Hector that you used to lick as he slowly stripped himself of his armor. Hector was a warrior; you are nothing but a soft prince.  You watch when Achilles strikes your brother down, watch your brother's glorious form fall under the wrath of a goddess's son, and you can almost hear your brother telling you again that he hates you, that you are the reason he won't live to see the sun set this day.  When Achilles drives around the city with your brother's corpse tied to the chariot, you turn away from the dust beginning to cover Hector's handsome figure. The spectators on the walls weep, and though you yourself do not, you think that they have no reason to cry at a hero's death when only you ever loved him the way he deserved to be loved.  No one stops you when you leave for your rooms, too caught up in their own grief and despair at the seemingly inevitable doom of Troy to even notice you slipping away. You don't cry; you don't know how to because you have never before had an occasion to do so.  You only hope Hector forgives you  You stand upon the city walls, and you can discern Achilles by the godly armor he wears. You think of your dead brother's beautiful body burned at the pyre, think of how you will never again see the sunlight glinting off of your brother's armor as he fights, and you want nothing but revenge for the death of the only person you ever loved. You know Phoebus Apollo favored Hector, and you pray he may help you, too.  The thick dust before Troy rises as the day's battle begins, and you whisper to the glint of gold shining through the hazy cloud at irregular intervals, ""Dust you are, and to dust you shall return.""  because though you caused his death, you will also avenge him. He is the only person you ever loved, and   He is the only person you will ever love.  04.02.24";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

That she wasn't twenty-one, for starters. She was thirty-two when she died and looked every day of it. History has proved that to be a bad age for great and careless people (Gilles Villeneuve and Swami Vivekananda, for example. Karen Carpenter.) Astrologically, Pluto comes around to visit you when you're thirty-two, after the exuberant carelessness of Zeus and Hermes have showered you in their bright, unseeing light. When Pluto comes, the blindness recedes from your eyes as his cool, leaden shadow falls over you, and he will make you answer for every excess of your youth. Everyone knows that this was the revenge of the stars on Alexander the Great, who died of a mysterious fever at the age of thirty-two, but at this time the Aegeans were not yet a superstitious lot, because their lives were not yet governed by the cold and impersonal light of distant planets, just very powerful gods, against whose randomness no salt over your shoulder and no straw men could guard you.  But he was twenty-one, still the darling of benevolent divinities. He remained so until the end. Perhaps they knew that they had already taken everything he could give. It is not often that human beings have a choice as stark as that which was offered to Achilles, son of Peleus, which is one way of looking at it. He had been at war for about five years by then - five years in Troy proper, that is, because the other way of looking at it was that Achilles had always been at this war, that he learned to walk and run and fight and be, because he was always, always, always meant to be this soldier on this plain, his glory as inevitable as death, as inevitable as the sky in his rainy-grey eyes.  He walked into a bar. They all did that on their furloughs. He was still a general; the Myrmidons were going to raze this town to the ground later sometime, but he had time for a drink before it happened. There were townsfolks lingering on the shore, holding hands, singing, looking dreamily at the horizon. There was nothing to disturb the view, no ominous looming figures of black ships. This little Pleasantville would be a minor operation, mainly scheduled for keeping his soldiers' hand in as and when strategy ordered them off the plain.  No one seemed to know who he was. He sat at the bar and asked for wine. Over in the corner an old woman was telling a gathering the story of Tantalus and how he cut up and served his own son Pelops as food for the gods. He watched the storyteller wave her hands, painting pictures of the horror, only half-listening. He knew this story of course; he had seen it enacted before his very eyes when they set out to sail. Agamemnon had murdered his own daughter to ensure good winds for the journey. Iphigeneia had been young, intelligent and gorgeous, very enthusiastic about being married to Achilles himself. That hadn't worked out. She had fought frantically before they killed her. The funny thing was, Pelops had been her great-grandfather, Agamemnon and Menelaus' grandfather. It had never occurred to her that the gods might resurrect her the way they did Pelops. It had never occurred to her at all that history was repeating itself.  ""Nothing much's changed, has it?"" a voice sounded in his ear. He turned and there she was, dressed in combat fatigues and leather. She was tall, bronzed, with the sort of body that took years of fencing and running and good hard knocks to build up. She had long, olive-black hair and eyes darker than any child of Priam's. Achilles thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.  ""Still bloodthirsty buggers, the lot of them."" She sat down next to him and signalled for wine, too. ""It's the curse, isn't it. You can't end it. Their fathers and forefathers will all haunt them until they have their own mouthfuls.""  Achilles remembered the omen after her sacrifice. ""Like a snake,"" he said. ""Swallowing - ""  ""Its own eggs. Exactly,"" she finished, picking up the cup before her and draining it in a gulp. ""Who's the redhead, then?""  He stared at her, wondering what had happened to him. ""Hi, I'm talking to you, Sparky,"" she waved five long, callused fingers before his face and laughed.  ""Pyrrhus,"" he said, not taking his eyes off her face. ""I'm Pyrrhus. And you're lovely.""  ""Whatever gave you that idea?"" She looked pleased, tilting her head and looking him over appreciatively. ""Try Penny.""  ""Penny,"" he breathed. ""Penelope?""  ""Ugh, no,"" she laughed again. ""Penelope is a horrible name. So is Penny, but my only other option is Silly. Very silly. I discourage people from addressing me by name as a rule.""  Achilles made an effort to smile, even though his heart seemed in danger of beating its way right out of his mouth at any moment. ""Not even your lovers?""  ""Especially not my lovers,"" she said, raising an eyebrow.  ""So what should I call you, then?"" It was out before he knew it, as inevitable, really, as everything else about him. Her eyebrow shot up a little higher, an eagle's wing upon her brow, and she said, ""'Your majesty' will do.""     --  Three years later  They knew they were fighting each other even before the masks of war came off. It was in the movements, the curve of an arm as it swept around the other's body, the sweat-damp curls that escaped from a helmet, the surprise and the ferocity in the cries of passion. Things that no lover ever forgot about Achilles or Penthesilea. Time had drawn them close once more, almost as close as they had been that night in the town that was not so much as a memory even in the minds of its destroyers.  He found an opening and wounded her arm slightly before she pulled back and swung hard at his head. She was strong. She could crush and wound you and make you utterly forget who you were. She did not give you time or space. She would mean everything to you, consume you and give nothing back. He could not crumble to dust for her, though. He might have; it might have been easy and possible, but there were reasons that he did not, too many reasons, all of which came down to the single fact that he was not meant for her. Three years ago they had been drinking wine together and talking about the sons of Atreus. She had told him that they were cursed, and he had agreed, and wondered how the curse could be broken.  She had shrugged as if she did not care, and said, ""By someone brave enough to reverse destiny. To swallow the snake. To kill the father - or kill themselves.""  He looked her in the eye and advanced towards her. He remembered the wisdom in them. She beat him back, attacking him with new reserves of energy that welled up in her just as she seemedd about to give up. It would not be too difficult to be beaten by this woman. You could give yourself up with honour; she would destroy you so completely that nothing, not even shame, could be left. She could entwine and break the threads of fate, invert destiny and kill the killer.  He thought, and thought that a curse was not a bargain with the gods. The House of Atreus could reverse their fortunes, but he could never break his.  He did not hate her for being unable to change what always had been. He did not even hate for dying when she finally did, sword knocked out of her hand, his blade sliced clean through her heart. She had her destiny too, and he was it. She had not made a bargain, she had not been cursed. She was beautiful and brave and he had loved her for it, but he never thought that she might have deserved more.  She was lying sprawled, still on the ground. Someone pulled her helmet off gently - she had fought well - and the hair, still long and black, fanned out on the earth around her. Her eyes were open, the wisdom gone, the fear gone. He knelt beside her to close them and noticed the eagle-wing brows, furled now, bleached by daylight battles.  ""I hope you're clean, gorgeous,"" she had said on the stairs, leaning against the banister to look down at him. The eyebrows kept flying upwards, as though he were a perpetual incredulity. And he was.  Someone murmured his name. A crowd had gathered around them. Her blood pooled about them, lapping at his knees.  I'm not, he thought, kissing the forehead, smooth and fading without life. I carry my death with me, and now you have yours.  What can you say about a twenty-one year old boy who died? Pluto never had the chance to summon him. He was actually twenty-eight when it happened, the arrow flying into his heel almost an accident, if anything the stars have orchestrated for eternities can be an accident.

""";narrator;third;Hector;Hector;;;;;Achilles;Achilles;;;;;unspecified;killed;;;;;"  ""Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss: ...Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.Here will I dwell, for heaven be in these lips,And all is dross that is not Helena!""  --Christopher Marlowe, The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus     She had the beauty of a goddess, did Helen of Sparta, but it was empty--hollow--like the gilding on a wooden chair long since decayed, only a shell. It was an inhuman beauty on a human woman; she lacked the substance to fill it, and it left her with as much animation as that fragile breath of gold. A goddess would have taken that face and form and made them desirable, or commanding, or both--she could have filled them, while Helen had her human limitations. She was her husband's prize but not his beloved, a shocking and beautiful possession.  Aphrodite, filled with careless mischief that bled into malice, winged on by her triumph over Hera and Athena, knew this better perhaps than any mortal could, this daughter of the ocean foam or of Zeus, goddess of beauty and desire--she saw and understood that Helen, in possessing the one to such excess, could not inspire the other. And so she set that fire of want in Paris of Troy's heart and watched, knowing he would have his reward.  No man had ever spoken of passion to Helen, and all that she knew of such words she had overheard, or learned from songs; the glory of being called beautiful in tones not of cool reason but burning emotion overwhelmed her entirely.  Greece was a land where she had been a thing--in Troy, she had hoped, it would be different.  It was not.  In Troy she was a catalyst, a beginning, the cause for war and destruction, and as time passed and Aphrodite's magic faded from Paris he came to see Helen as others did. And she, blindly confused at first and then with anger that grew with comprehension, railed against the gods who had brought her to this--who had allowed her to be born as she was, with a beauty she could not be--who had used her, used her as harshly as humans ever had, as a thing.  Paris was not what she had expected him to be--had thought he was--and her infatuation faded; but as the war continued, grinding all the men and joy of a generation down into the dust for the gods to trample, she fell in love.  Hector brother of Paris, son of Priam, spoke to Helen as to any other human--showed her the real kindness he did to all of his people--laid no blame on her for the horrors she had brought to him. And that honest decency caught her and held her, and burned like fire in her veins. He was among the best of men, was Hector husband of Andromache, father of Astynax, beloved.  Andromache gave herself up to grief and rage when Achilles killed him, but Helen fell into herself. When the walls of Troy were breached and the towers burned, fire leaping into the skies, the pyre of her dreams--when Troy fell, Helen went numbly, cold and frozen, back to Sparta. She had children there, and their love was in its way as true and pure as Hector's had been in his. That, finally, eased away the ice from all that burning.  (Centuries later, Marlowe wrote of her as one like a goddess herself, with the power and the presence that her beauty had needed. She would have laughed to hear that, had she been able to cease her weeping at the words for long enough.)  Now, here, in the afterworld, where all go in their times, and our appearances are shaped by our minds, here is Helen. That terrible dehumanizing Beauty is gone: hers is a lovely face, but not one to launch a fleet or burn a city. Here, at last, she finds peace.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

The bars are hers and the strip joints are hers and the sheriff is in her pocket. Every other club that wants to run product up or down the coast has to pass through her town and they pay for the privilege. If they think that the only all-female motorcycle club for seven states is going to be a pushover, they are quickly proved wrong. The desert has a wide embrace to welcome the dead.  There is a woman in Artemis' bed and she does what she must to keep her there. Kallisto is bright and golden; she smells of gasoline and warm asphalt and everything Artemis loves. Artemis leaves epic poems of her devotion with her teeth on Kallisto's thighs, presses her desire inside on the tip of her tongue. Kallisto sobs and begs, hips rolling, but Artemis doesn't let go. Her love is greedy; Kallisto knew that before she ever kissed her, quick and chaste behind the garage in the fall when the weather was turning. Now it is summer and the sweat stands out on her lover's skin. Artemis laps it from the hollow of her throat, fingers slick and curling.  Her life is everything she wanted when she left her father's house.  She's afraid it won't last.     The trouble starts small. Her father's Olympians are scaring patrons out of Arktoi bars, harassing the staff, driving club profits down. It's petty, no less than she expected from her father but so much milder than she dreamed. It still needs to be dealt with. She still doesn't want to.  ""I'll go for you,"" Kallisto says one morning over breakfast.  Artemis' head jerks up. ""You're sure?""  ""Of course. If he's half the asshole you've said he is, you don't need to be anywhere near him."" Kallisto dishes scrambled eggs onto their plates. ""I'm your second; I can speak for you. I'll get it sorted out and be back by dinner.""  She isn't back by dinner.     Artemis finds her in the kitchen the next morning, clutching a cup of coffee, eyes bloodshot. Before Artemis can ask what happened, Kallisto walks out.  They play a game of avoidance for weeks. Kallisto shows up to club meetings and her shifts at the garage, but she won't sleep in Artemis' bed, won't even meet her eyes.  Artemis corners her eventually in the hall bathroom, hunched over the toilet. Kallisto is only dry heaving, nerves and not illness; the source is obvious--a pregnancy test lies forgotten in the sink. Artemis doesn't bother to count the blue lines; her sinking feeling drops all the way through the floor.  ""Who was it?"" (She knows already and hates that she knows.) ""Who?"" she howls and Kallisto flinches.  Kallisto drags the back of her hand over her mouth, scrubbing away bile. ""It was your father.""     Kallisto tells her what happened in fits and starts. Artemis sits beside her on the bathroom floor, close but not touching, and listens. It's a familiar story.  (Artemis remembers Leda, one of the Olympians' women. She got along with everybody, always had a smile and a kind word. Once, after a patching over, she'd been making eyes at a new guy all night. It had been enough to set off Zeus's temper.  She remembers watching Zeus throw Leda down on a pool table and fuck her right there in front of everyone; the wings of her swan tattoo flexing along her shoulder blades as she tried to crawl away.  Artemis had been twelve.)  Eventually, carefully, they move back into Artemis' room. She spoons up behind Kallisto on the bed, slides one hand around to rest on her stomach.  This could be her child. The only child she may ever have.  ""It's gonna be alright,"" Artemis says. ""We'll make it alright.""  ""Yes,"" Kallisto breathes back. ""We will.""     Artemis is wrist-deep in an engine rebuild when her phone rings. She wipes her hands off, digs her phone out from her pocket. ""What.""  ""Art."" It's her brother. He's the only one who ever got away with calling her that. (He stayed behind and most days she doesn't blame him. It's not like Daddy was trying to watch him in the shower.)  ""Your girl's been here for the last two hours. She's in Dad's office; sounds like they're just talking, but--""  ""Yeah."" Sometimes talking is dangerous enough. ""Thanks, Apollo. I appreciate it.""  ""Of course, sweetheart. Stay safe, okay?""  She hangs up so she won't have to lie to him.     The following night, Artemis and Kallisto go for a ride.   (It's something they did more often when the club was young: take just one bike and a blanket and drive out into the desert well past dark. They'd watch the stars and make out like teenagers until it got too cold to stand.)  Kallisto wanders in a slow circle after they park, talking about her doctor's appointment and the girls she met in the waiting room. Artemis drops the kickstand, draws her gun from the saddlebag.  ""Get on your knees, honey.""   Kallisto glances back, a smile already starting to form. She thinks Artemis is flirting right up until she spots the gun. The blood drains from her face. ""Artemis, please--""  ""Turn the fuck around and get down on your knees.""  She does, slowly, shakily, hands raised. ""Baby, you've got to understand--""  Artemis doesn't want to hear it. ""I understand perfectly. You sold me out.""  ""No, no, that's not true."" Kallisto risks a peek over her shoulder; her pupils are blown in fear. ""I...I made a deal, yeah, but it's the best thing for all of us. It's going to keep us safe. We just...we just have to get patched over, and then he'll leave us alone.""  ""He'll leave us alone,"" Artemis repeats. ""I should give up my club--my club--because you think he'll keep his word?""  ""You'll lose the club anyway!"" Kallisto screams. The silence after is ringing, lasts for a solid minute before Kallisto adds, ""He's so angry, baby. We have to take his terms. Do you know what he wants to do to us? Do you know what he wants to do to you?""  ""Of course I fucking know!""  (She's known for years, known since he looked up and smiled, one hand pressing bruises into the back of Leda's neck. He did everything but touch her and she thought she was safe.  Whatever she does now, it will be war: with her father first, and then whatever's left of the Olympians after. She doesn't care. She wants a war, wants bloodshed and ruin, wants the world to suffer for almost being everything she hoped for.  But this could be her child. The only child she may ever have.)  ""I did it for you,"" Kallisto is sobbing. ""I did it for us.""  ""I know, baby."" Artemis pulls the trigger.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

Just for a flash, a second long scene. She stands over him, a sword in her hand. I taste the metallic tang of blood in my mouth, just for a moment. Since the sack of Troy I have drifted through days, a victim of a catastrophe too vast to stop. I tried to warn my people, but my words were not heeded, my visions not believed. All the death and violence came crashing over us in a flood that could not be halted. Since that night I have wandered like a ghost in the Greek camp, a shade in the body of a girl. My skin is cold and clammy to the touch. The men put their hands on me and I feel nothing, my mind drifting loose, like oil upon the surface of water.   And then Agamemnon, leader of the Greeks, claims me for his captive. As his hands come down on my shoulders I see this, this image of his doom. For the first time in many days I feel something leap inside of me. I see the conqueror of my city brought low by his own wife. I laugh aloud. He looks at me, incredulous, perhaps wondering if I am really as mad as they say, but my laughter does not stop him. I do not laugh again. Later, when he leaves to confer with the other Greek leaders, I turn the vision over in my mind. The fierce joy flares in me again, and I am glad to know Agamemnon will not go unpunished. She must be a singular woman, his queen. The first few days I longed to join my father in death, but this vision, this woman, causes hope to kindle within me. I will see him dead.   We sail across the Aegean, lashed by winds and terrible storms. When we pass by the coastline of his country, a beacon flares into life. His ships sail into the harbour, and he leaves his soldiers camped down in the city. The sun is sinking below the horizon, staining the sky crimson and gold. He takes me in his chariot, and we mount the hill to his palace. As we reach the top I see another beacon burning. Our arrival is expected.   We approach the palace. In the gathering dark I see her standing there. Clytaemnestra. She is a single figure, lit by two lines of torches. Her arms are bare, encircled by bands of gold. Her skin is golden too, thick muscles beneath its surface. Around her neck a torque of gold glistens. Gold stitching upon her dress outlines the powerful lines of her body. The torches burn bright in the darkness, and she blazes too. They outline a path up to the palace steps where she is standing. The light shines upon her jewellery, on her skin, and she seems to shimmer before us like one of my visions. As the chariot stops beside the path of torches she steps to the left and claps her hands. The palace doors are thrown open behind her. Servants come out, bearing a long red tapestry. They unroll it, throwing it down the steps. It unfurls dark as blood, a red tide flowing out between the lines of torches. I gasp. In my mind I see the steps of the palace in Troy flow with blood, real blood, liquid and sticky. It smelled of rot and the grave and the sea.   Clytaemnestra strides forward, beside the tapestry, not upon it. Her long tawny hair falls wild and loose down her back, like the mane of a lion. I have never seen a lion in the wild, but my father had one brought to the palace once. It prowled in its cage, movements constrained by the bars. She reminds me of its captive grace, and the sense I had that were the bars removed it would explode into violence. She comes to stand before us, at the foot of the pathway she has created. Agamemnon steps down from the chariot and she smiles, showing her teeth.   They speak, and at her urging he strides forward upon the tapestries, his feet treading upon the thick red path. In my memory, he and his men stalk forward as Troy burns, their sandals soaking up blood. He goes through the doors alone, and Clytaemnestra turns to me.   'Come princess, there is no need to remain in the chariot. Come into the palace, my women will see you bathed and dressed.' Her smile does not touch her eyes. I say nothing, thinking of the lion again, and her teeth. She raises her eyebrows. 'My husband is very taken with you, little bird. Perhaps he is in love. You do not have to speak to me, if you do not wish, but come inside.'   I find my voice. 'Why do you call me that?'   She laughs. 'You are so dark and still, you make me think of the nightingales in my gardens at dusk. And I have heard tales of your visions, your songs.'   I do not speak again, but allow her women to lead me from the chariot and into the palace. I do not trust her kind words. She spoke as sweetly to her husband, and I know the malice which must fester in her heart toward him.   There are low fires lit within the whole palace, so that the marble floors shine with light, and flickering shadows crowd in the corners. I am led to a bath chamber, a bronze tub brimming with water, rose petals floating on its surface. Steam clouds the air. The servants take my clothes and do not return them. I sink into the water and let out a sigh. It is soothing upon my skin, which seems to soften beneath its surface. I smell sweet now, like flower sap. I look up and find Clytaemnestra standing there, watching me. I cannot read her expression. Her brow furrows.   'How came you by that?' she asks, indicating a bruise the size of a palm upon my breast. I look down, and remember.   I speak without thinking. 'That, that is the love token your husband left upon me.' I am surprised by the venom in my voice. So, it seems, is she. Her lips part, as if she would speak, but a servant comes in.   'Milady, the King wishes her brought to him.'   Clytaemnestra nods. 'Of course.'   I am given a white dress to wear. It is cool upon my skin, still hot from the bath. We walk through the palace. Water clings to my hair, weighing it down. The girl takes me to a bedroom, and then leaves. He is standing there waiting, and smiles to see me. My pulse flutters beneath my breast. I thought I had forgotten how to feel, my emotions dying with my father at Troy, but being in this house has awoken them again. He walks toward me and I feel a sick dread. Maybe I am not the dead girl I thought. The naked want in his eyes is obscene. He props his sword against the bed and comes closer, close enough that I can see the individual hairs in his finely trimmed beard, like little spikes. Do not touch me, I think. I do not want your hands on me again. I do not, cannot, speak, but let him manoeuvre me, backing me toward the bed. His teeth shine in the torchlight as he smiles. My newly awoken fear has aroused him. I feel nausea swoop in my stomach and find myself longing for the numbness I had felt in my shock. He looks at me and sees my city burning. I am a trophy to him, a marker of his victory. I think again of Clytaemnestra. She will avenge my city and me, whether she knows it or not. It is as if this summons her. I look over his shoulder and see her behind, stalking forward on quiet feet, her sword raised. My eyes meet hers for a second. She raises an eyebrow. I look back at him, seeking to keep his attention fixed on me. She moves closer.   'Agamemnon,' she says, her voice low. 'This is for our daughter.' He turns at her voice, his hand going to his hip as he registers her words, but of course his sword is not there. Her blade plunges into his stomach and out, dark blood spurting forth, spattering her dress. Her smile is so wide it is a grimace, a snarl. He falls sideways onto the floor, crying out wordlessly in pain and surprise. His head hits the ground but he is still moving. One hand goes to his waist, coming up red. The other gropes behind him, reaching for his sword. I am faster. I snatch it up and unsheathe it, the scabbard clattering on the floor.   'This is for my people,' I say, and I stab down into his flesh, a hand span higher than the wound she has given him. It goes in deep. I am stronger than I thought. He coughs, red foam gathering on his lips. I leave the sword in him and step back, looking down. Impaled, helpless, he shudders and jerks, pinned by his own sword. He tries to speak, but only spits blood onto the floor. She kneels beside him, gripping his head with her hand.   'For Iphigenia,' she says, her lips near his, and she presses her sword down and across, slitting his throat. His lifeblood gushes forth, splashing into her smiling mouth, streaking her skin, dark flecks landing on her like red petals. She stands and looks at me.   'So,' she says. 'Why did you help me?' If I thought my heart beat fast before, it is nothing to now. It throbs in my temples, my throat, hummingbird fast. I meet her eyes. She is still smiling, fierce and wide. Awed, I incline my head toward her. Blood drips from her sword onto the floor, joining the spreading pool there. She stands like a statue, terrible and still. I look up at her again, unable to keep my eyes from her.   'You are not the only one he has hurt,' I say.   'I did not do this for you,' she says after a pause.   I laugh. 'No, and yet it is done nonetheless. We gave him a quicker death than he deserved.'   'Is that so, little nightingale?' she says. The blood, his blood, still glistens upon her lips in the torchlight. She steps around him, closer to me. 'You are even more vicious than I thought.'   'Maybe so. Will you kill me as well?' I ask, raising my chin. I know the answer, but I want to hear her say it, to make her admit it. I can almost taste the blood in my mouth.   'No,' she says quietly, very close to me now. 'You helped me,' she says. 'I will not forget.' I can see her chest rise and fall in her excitement, a vein throbbing in her throat. I cannot help myself; I reach out for her, and kiss her. The sword is still in her hand, but the other comes up, stroking my wet hair. I fall against her, clinging to her. She tastes of the death she has wrought, salt blood upon her lips. She drops the sword, but I do not hear it hit the floor, a roaring in my ears. We fall back upon the bed. Her weight presses me down, her touch upon my skin blotting out everything. I feel more than I have in days, a tide of sensation, my pulse beating like drums inside of me. I am giddy with triumph. I kiss the trail of blood from her neck, her throat, her cheek. It is like ambrosia upon my lips, the taste of victory and vengeance.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;1;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;semantic

Even as she stared at her reflection in the pond outside her home, Medusa didn't see what her mother kept bragging about. She wasn't ugly, that could be plainly seen, but she wasn't the most stunning woman ever created. Her blond hair was softer than most and her skin was a soft peach color that was smooth to the touch. Many a man had asked for her hand, but she turned them down one by one, knowing that it was her beauty she was to be married for and nothing more.  Her mother would sometimes, in hushed tones, praise her by saying that she rivaled the beauty of the nymphs and even Aphrodite herself. In response, Medusa would blush, say nothing, but would then go to the temple of Aphrodite and pray that the goddess would restrain her wrath for the day. Every night, she would return and pray again, thanking the goddess for not striking down her mother. Many people had seen Medusa enter the temple alone and believed that she was praying the Aphrodite to enhance her beauty. They were nothing but rumors, but many of the common folk ended up believing them.  Today, though, Medusa was visiting another goddess; Athena, Goddess of Wisdom. Medusa's mother had bid her to take the offerings to the temple and thank the goddess for blessing them. The best of her father's crops were divided among sacrifices for Athena and Demeter and while her mother prayed to Demeter for the harvest, Medusa prayed to Athena.  Medusa bowed deeply to the idol of Athena, laying down her family's sacrifice for the month; the finest wheat her father had harvested, the first batch of milk the family goat had made, the first figs harvested. The gifts were simple, yet Medusa knew that they pleased the goddess. Making sure that the gifts were arranged perfectly at the foot of the statue, she called out to one of the priestesses to let her know that her family made a sacrifice.  ""May Athena's blessings come to you,"" the priestess replied.  Medusa bowed again and prostrated herself before the idol, praying for Athena's blessing on her family in the days ahead.  ""Why dost thou bow?"" a deep voice said from behind her, ""Thou art matched with the beauty of this goddess.""  Medusa got up from her position and turned to face the one who spoke.  The man standing behind her was attractive, to say the least. He was tall and broad shouldered, a small beard adorning his angular face. His deep blue eyes were looking her over as though she was something to be devoured.  ""I would not be so vain as to compare myself to the gods,"" she replied.  ""But what if I was a god?"" the man asked, stepping closer to her, ""What if I truly believed that thou hast a beauty to rival that of Athena herself?""  Medusa shuffled back. ""I would think that you were foolish and should not speak of such things in a goddess's temple.""  ""Then let me discuss it another way with thy beautiful form."" The man moved forward and pulled himself onto Medusa's body. Her eyes widened and she began to scream as the world faded around her, leaving just herself and the man.  Medusa's knew nothing but water. Deep blue filled her vision as waves lapped at her exposed flesh. She writhed as the waves rocked her and screamed again, not caring if the water surrounding her filled her lungs and drowned her. That would be a just punishment for what she was doing.  As suddenly as it happened, it was done. Medusa opened her eyes, the man nowhere in sight.  ""Thy punishment is decided,"" a loud voice echoed through the temple, ""Thy once beloved beauty is gone. All who look upon thee now shall be so disgusted that they shall turn to stone.""  Then, the voice was gone and Medusa found herself alone next to the idol, bruised and afraid.  ""Lady Medusa, are you alright?"" the soft voice of a priestess called out, ""The goddess has inflicted her wrath upon someone in the temple and I-""  Medusa raised her head and the priestess stopped speaking. The other woman's mouth opened into a large 'O' and she stepped backwards, her eyes wide in fear. Medusa scowled and a soft hissing noise filled her ears.  The priestess stopped her backwards retreat, her feet seemingly rooted to the ground. There was a soft clicking as the silk slippers she wore seemed to harden and turn a soft shade of grey. Then, her ankles began the strange transformation, then her calves and her thighs. Medusa saw the girl struggle, but she noticed how the priestess's eyes remained on her at all times. The priestess's whole body turned grey and Medusa watched as one of the priestess's veins pulsed slowly through its alabaster prison. She watched with her own horror as it slowed to a stop, the priestess now a sister to the idol standing next to her.  Medusa wanted to cry, wanted to scream, but she couldn't bring herself to. The power she had felt ending the priestess's life was...intoxicating. She absentmindedly licked her lips, a small part of her mind wondering if this was to be part of her punishment.  _____________________  The man looked no different from the others; same weapons, same arrogant nature about him, the same intent to kill her. Medusa had killed hundreds of men with a single glance; this newcomer was nothing but another nameless body to be added to the list of deceased. No one who met her gaze ever breathed again.  Medusa couldn't help the feral grin that graced her lips. That's why she had been placed on this cursed spit of rock with her 'sisters', the Gorgans. Her gaze had ended many a life on the mainland and, Posiden, the god whose actions had caused this curse to come upon her, had ferried her away to the Island of the Gorgans so that she would not harm another mortal.  Yet, every man that set foot on the island was added to her collection of statues. She had hundreds hoarded in her own little corner of the island. Every day, she would gaze at the statues, caressing their faces and kissing their frozen lips, wondering if this would be as close as she would ever get to truly kissing a man. Posiden's rape was still etched into her body as though her own had been made of stone that day, but she wanted a true love instead of a god's affection. Even the pleasure of turning men into stone was beginning to bore her.  The man that was approaching her now was still no different than all the others. He was young; too young to be out hunting dangerous things like her. His eyes were bright with youth, but Medusa could see age beginning to find its way into his strong face. Unlike the other men, she noted, he moved slowly, holding up a golden shield instead of a sword. He was moving the shield around him, scrutinizing it with determination.  ""You're a smart one,"" she said aloud, making the young man stop in his tracks, ""Using a mirror to figure out my location. I must say that I am impressed.""  The man closed his eyes as she finished speaking, raising the shield so that it was angled away from his body.  Medusa licked her lips. Yes, this was turning out to be very interesting.  ""What are you called, boy?"" she asked, moving closer to him. She relished the feeling of power as the man's body tensed.  ""Perseus,"" he replied. Medusa reached out and caressed his cheek, loving the feel of warm flesh against her fingers. She could feel Perseus's pulse increase as her finger lingered.  ""And why have you come?"" she whispered, ""It must have something to do with me. Everyone who steps foot on this island wants to kill me for one reason or another.""  Perseus bit his lip, almost debating whether or not he should reveal his quest to the thing that could end his life as soon as he let his guard down. He let his lip go, resolve urging him on. ""I have come for the head of the ugly Medusa to kill the man who is going to marry my mother.""  Medusa snatched her hand away. ""'Ugly?'"", she repeated, ""There is nothing ugly about me. Years ago, I was adored by many, most of them saying that my beauty rivaled the gods. Athena's curse couldn't have affect that much..."" Looking back on the years she spent before she was sentenced to life on the island, she had never thought of looking in a reflective surface. She stayed as far away from water as she could, ever afraid that Posiden would come for her again.  Perseus hesitated. ""You don't know?"" he asked, his eyes still screwed shut. His arm moved slowly, bringing the shield he held closer to her. Its surface glinted in the dim light and Medusa came face to face with her reflection.  Medusa stared at herself in horror as she gazed at her reflection. The form of her body hadn't changed much, but she noticed several changes to the contents of her once desired body. Her smooth skin was cracked and looked almost scaly in some places. Her now snake-like eyes widened as she stared at her face, old age and the spell taking its toll in the form of craggy wrinkles and sagging flesh. Medusa almost cried out in shock when she saw that her beautiful golden hair was now a pile of snakes attached to her scalp. They hissed in distress as she reached for them, wanting to tear them out of her and throw them in the dust. They coiled themselves gently around her wrists, their hisses turned soothing as they rubbed their ugly heads against her skin, trying to soothe her.  ""I never realized..."" she murmured, the horror gone from her face, but her serpent eyes still gazed at her reflection. ""I guess I am no longer beautiful now.""  And then she heard the sound of steel slicing through flesh and she saw the sky for a moment before everything went black.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;1;0;semantic
17006691;"""The prophecy says if Troilus dies before he's twenty, the Achaeans will succeed."" [...] ""He draws his sword and puts the tip to the base of Troilus's perfect neck; Troilus bows his head almost as if he understands that this must happen, because the gods have willed it even if the two of them do not. Achilles washes Apollo's marble feet with the blood of his beautiful son and he leaves the body there before him.""";narrator;third;Troilus;Troilus;;;;;Achilles;Achilles;;;;;beheading;sword;;;;;"The Trojans call him son of Priam, but Achilles knows better than that.   The fact is, divinity knows divinity; what is divine within Achilles recognises it in any others of the same persuasion that he might meet. He knew it in Heracles, once upon a time at Chiron's table, and he knows it in Sarpedon of Lycia, who is set to fight against Greece with the Trojans. He knows it in the youth standing before him, too. What the Achaeans whisper about him is true: Troilus is Hecuba's, yes, but not by the king of Troy. He is Apollo's son. Achilles can feel it.   Of course, where Apollo's children are concerned, that moment of instinctive, bodily recognition is not something he requires. Children of Zeus feel powerful, as if lit up from within with a spark of their father's lightning bolt. Children of Ares feel strong, as if filled up with their father's thirst for war. Children of Apollo, on the other hand, are almost uniformly radiant; they are beautiful, which necessitates no special skill in its perception. But it is, perhaps, because Achilles can both see and feel Apollo's radiance within Troilus, Prince of Troy, that desire cuts him as keenly as it does.   Outside, by the fountain, he reached up one hand and tore Troilus down from the back of his horse. Troilus fled into the nearby temple, a distraction so that his sister might escape, and despite his knowing this, Achilles followed him inside. Perhaps one day he will concern himself with Polyxena but she is entirely earthly and, as such, she does not tempt him as her brother does. Neither is she the reason he has come. She is not the reason he was sent.  They stand now at the darkened altar in the braziers' hot, unsteady light. There could be no escape but through him, and though Troilus is not small, and Troilus does not cower, he is not Achilles's match.   ""You know who I am,"" says Troilus.   ""Yes,"" replies Achilles, though he understands the words were not a question to be answered.   ""You know who I am within myself. As Helen does.""  Achilles met Helen once, not so very long ago. Beautiful Helen, prized Helen, pretext for Agamemnon's fucking war that Achilles is not sure he wants to play a part in. She is a daughter of Zeus and he knew it in the very first instant that they stepped into each other's presence; her sister is a daughter of Tyndareus, and he knew that in a much more mundane way. After all, Castor and Clytemnestra are to their twins what night is to day: paler, and colder, and wanting for dawn's divine light.   ""Yes,"" Achilles says. ""I know that.""   ""You mean to kill me.""   ""Yes.""   ""In this place?""  ""Yes.""   ""But you know who...""  Achilles raises his brows and quickly, Troilus understands. Achilles can see the realisation of it in the expression settling on his face and in the stiffening in his body.   ""You mean to kill me because you know,"" says Troilus.  Achilles nods curtly. He has yet to draw his sword, but he will do so, inevitably, inexorably, and Troilus clearly knows this. Troilus does not say my father will be angry, because it is clear Achilles knows this. He does not say please spare me, because he knows Achilles won't. As he draws himself up tall and taut and very brave, what he says is, ""Do it quickly,"" but Achilles cannot promise this. He would like to say he wishes that he could, but that would be a lie. He is many things, but he is not a liar.   What is divine within Achilles recognises what is divine in Troilus, and he wonders. He wants to know how Troilus's skin might taste against his lips, drenched as it has been by Trojan sun. He wants to know how his blood might taste against his tongue, infused as it is with Apollo's light. He grits his teeth. He clenches his jaw. He clutches tight at the hilt of his sword that hangs there ready at his waist. Achilles is not known for his steadiness, for his moderation, or his control. He does not expect to keep any of these things for long.   ""Will you do what I tell you to?"" Achilles asks. It sounds much like a response Troilus's request for his celerity, as if a prerequisite for Achilles's compliance, and though it's not he does not clarify. He tells himself that's not a kind of lie within itself.   ""What do you want?"" Troilus asks. He sounds careful. He sounds wary, for which Achilles cannot blame him.  ""Take off your clothes, prince,"" Achilles replies. He sees no reason to elaborate. It gets the point across.  Troilus understands. He does not look pleased, but he understands, and after a moment's quiet consideration - Achilles could not call it hesitation as it seems to him to be quite measured and deliberate - he unties the belt from about his waist and drops it to the temple floor. His short chiton hangs more loosely then against his skin, still creased above his hips where his belt cinched it in, and he reaches deft fingers to the pins that hold it at his shoulders. He drops the pins, too, deliberately, with a clatter of gold on stone, then he lets the tunic fall. He is naked beneath and in his veins, Achilles's blood burns with all the fire into which his mother dipped him. He thinks sometimes he took in the flames just as much as he did the ambrosia.  His skin bared in the firelight there in the temple of Apollo Thymbraios, at the altar by the feet of his divine father's towering statue, Troilus could almost be a god himself. He is as exquisite in his composition as if he were a statue hewn from living flesh in place of marble, from his elegant neck to his muscled arms, from the bow of his lips to the thick length of his manhood. He is radiant perfection. And, in that moment, Achilles finds that he both adores him and despises him. He is not sure which it is takes precedence.  He steps forward. He takes Troilus's bare shoulders in his hands and feels him flinch at his touch, but that does not deter him. He runs his palms and his fingertips down Troilus's long arms. His fingers encircle Troilus's wrists. His grip tightens.  The Trojan prince is perhaps just half Achilles's age, a beautiful ephebe not yet twenty years old, and Achilles is no great giant of a man, not like Ajax who seems to dwarf both the Trojan and Achaean armies to a man, so it should be no surprise that they stand eye to eye, equal in at least that one way. That small parity makes it all the easier for Achilles to press his mouth to Troilus's. It makes it all the easier for him to slip the fingers of one hand into Troilus's curling hair and kiss him, softly, as if he does so for no other reason but affection. And Troilus, perhaps because he thinks that it will spare his life, perhaps because he believes in what Achilles has allowed him to misapprehend of their situation, lifts his one free hand to rest cautiously at Achilles's waist. He returns the kiss. Achilles is unsure if he wishes him to pretend he's willing or if that ruins it entirely.   He knows what the gods would do, were they in his place. He knows what Zeus would do; Achilles is not the son of Zeus, but he might have been. Zeus wanted Achilles's mother, but the prophecy said that any son of Thetis would be greater than his father and so he left the having of her to Peleus. Achilles might have been born a god, but he was not. He was born mortal, just as so many are, but he is different because of what his mother did to him. Achilles is the man he is because he's not a man the way that others are. Almost all of that was burned away.   But, here and now, it seems he is his father's son: Peleus wanted Thetis, so he took her, very much against her will though very much with Zeus's; Achilles wants Troilus, so he takes him, too.   He extricates himself from Troilus's embrace and he takes off what he's wearing. He was sent to Thymbra to kill a prince and so accordingly he wore his armour; Troilus watches as he removes his breastplate and vambraces, then his greaves. He removes the tunic underneath, removes his sandals and steps barefoot onto the cold stone floor. Troilus watches as he strokes himself to hardness. Troilus, whether bravely or naively, does the same in front of him.   He bends him over the altar, dashing flowers and cups and bowls of offerings this way and that to make the space they need. He presses Troilus down with one palm firm between his shoulder blades. One of the bowls he's spilled was filled with olive oil and so he dips his fingers into what remains of it, then rubs them between Troilus's cheeks, against the hole he finds there.   ""Are you a virgin, prince?"" he asks, his voice almost a rasp as his fingertips tease. ""Has any other man had you?""  Troilus shakes his head, which is his answer. His fingers grip the altar. Achilles believes that's the truth of it; he'll be the first man and the last that Troilus ever knows.   He slicks himself with the same part-spilled oil, from base to tip, till he's dripping with it, and Troilus turns his head and cranes his neck to look as if he cannot help but do so. Because he knows that Troilus's eyes are on him, he strokes himself slowly. Because he knows Troilus is watching, he lifts his cock just a little so that he can see the oil drip down over his balls and catch against his thighs, the whole arrangement glistening in the firelight. Troilus blushes but he does not turn away, not until Achilles's hands move from himself and back to him instead. He parts Troilus's cheeks with both his palms. He directs the tip of his phallus to slip between them, the slick length of him rubbing over his hole.   When he pushes inside him, Troilus moans and grips more tightly at Apollo's altar till his fingers are almost uniformly white. His body is hot, a tight sheath for Achilles's cock as he seats himself inside him right down to the base. When Achilles moves in him, gripping at his hips with hands slippery with oil, Troilus pushes back against him though he curses softly against the stone.   ""You were made for this moment, Prince of Troy,"" Achilles says, with a catch in his voice as he flexes his hips to fuck him. He rakes his blunt nails over Troilus's perfect back, either side of his spine, raising livid red stripes in their wake. He rubs the first two fingers of his right hand between Troilus's cheeks, one either side of his own throbbing erection, to trace the rim of his tight hole. ""Don't you think Apollo made you for the length of my cock? Don't you think you fit me well?""   ""Yes,"" Troilus replies, with one cheek pressed tight against the altar. ""Yes,"" Troilus sobs, with one hand wrapped around his own erection. He comes with a gasp and a strangled sound that's almost as if Achilles had wrapped his hands around his throat, and he spends himself against the polished stone of Apollo's altar. Achilles believes he believes it, at least right here and now.   The sum of Troilus's existence is, within that moment, length and girth of Achilles's cock inside him, and so he pulls out of him abruptly. He pushes him down to his knees on the floor there at Apollo's feet and he follows him down to his own knees, then pushes in again before he can shudder for the lack of him. He comes inside him moments later, teeth gritted, groaning, looking up into Apollo's stony face. A kind of warm triumph floods his veins and he wraps his arms around Troilus's slim waist. He kisses the crook of Troilus's long neck. Kneeling there, softening though still pushed deep inside him, Troilus's bare back rests against Achilles's broad chest. They breathe almost in unison.   Achilles would like to take Troilus with him when he leaves the temple. He would bind his wrists and lash him to his chariot if that proved necessary, but he does not think it would; he believes Troilus would go with him of his own accord and lie with him in his tent on the beach where the Achaeans have made camp. Perhaps they would bathe together in the sea and later, once Apollo's Trojan sun had dried them, Achilles might lick the salt away from Troilus's tanned skin. He imagines pressing his mouth to Troilus's wrists, to his hips, to his temples by his dampened hairline, or the creases where his thighs merge with his body. He imagines the taste of his skin, of his cock, of his come, and sighs against his neck.   Achilles would like to take him with him when he leaves, but he knows he can't. The prophecy says if Troilus dies before he's twenty, the Achaeans will succeed. Troilus was made for two things, and only two: for Achilles's cock, and for the fall of Troy. Achilles knows neither of them will live to see the latter because for all that is divine in them, for all his mother's burnings and anointings, they both remain mortal. Fuck the gods, he thinks, that gave them this strange life placed halfway between the two. Fuck Apollo, who gave the world this boy that Achilles has to take from it.   He pulls back. He pulls out. He stands. They both shiver.   He draws his sword and puts the tip to the base of Troilus's perfect neck; Troilus bows his head almost as if he understands that this must happen, because the gods have willed it even if the two of them do not. Achilles washes Apollo's marble feet with the blood of his beautiful son and he leaves the body there before him. It's not the kind of sacrifice a god expects, but in the end, he does at least make it quick.  This will not be the only death before the war is done, and will not be the only one at Achilles's hands, but it's one he will remember.

One that threatened to sink everything and everyone on her tiny island.       Yet, she quieted and so did the storm. Her parents name her Philomela because her cries harmonized with the storm.         Sweet singer.        They named her with the hope she would live up to it, a soother of storms. Obedient.      _______________________________________________________________        As she grew so did her wonder and that her every curiosity was indulged. She was provided the best tutors, tutors who did more than teach her how to be a wife.        Philosophers, mathematicians, artists, all came through her father's court. Everything, she wanted to absorb everything. Know everything, go to all the fantastic places listed in her books. Be like the heroes of old.        It was silly of her, for one day her father would send her away to marry. Yet for now, she simply dreamed.        Dreamed of a better life. A more exciting one.        At age ten, she made a fatal mistake. Suggesting to her father that she should rule. He had all but laughed in her face       ""I have indulged you by giving you one of the finest educations a princess can obtain, yet."" His eyes glinted darkly, ""I see now I have made a grave mistake in letting you run wild. Now you spout nonsense about traveling and choosing whom you marry. You are a woman and it is time that you behaved as such. Learn your place, Philomela or by the Gods, you will regret it.""       That marked the end of her education, and on another level fractured her relationship with her father. He had always prided himself on being fair and ready to see reason especially when it came to her. She didn't recognize this strange man who called himself her father.       Obedient, of course she could be obedient and learn a woman's place. What did it matter? Learning a woman's place had earned her mother an early grave. Her poor mother had died with her younger brother all because to rule you needed a cock. Philomela did not have one but she had the next best thing, her wit.       So what if her father had driven away all her tutors, she was going to learn in other ways.        Was it so wrong to want more, more than just the promise of dying in childbirth for a husband that would replace you in a matter of months? She wanted to matter, she wanted to...be seen.    She is fourteen when she falls in love. It had been nothing like the poems or stories, it had crept up on her unaware.        Kallias served as one of her father's warriors, highly skilled with a sword. Just as his name suggested he was beautiful, but there was something about him that other men didn't seem to possess. He seemed more open to listening to her and her wild ideas, never judging just waiting patiently for her. Thoughts that women could be more than just wives and mothers that they could be more.       He sounded amused, yet she didn't feel as if he was mocking her, ""You mean like the Amazon women. For women to be known for their  battle strategies is this what you mean?.""       ""Well, ye-no. Actually-"" Those women were warriors, she had no training or skill. Kallias just grinned at her, his hazel eyes twinkling. She could feel he was holding back a laugh at her expense instead.       ""Princess if you wanted to learn the sword all you had to do was ask."" He said, tossing her a practice sword. It fumbled to the ground, but he tilted his head for her to pick it up. She hesitated for all but a moment.        So she did, those first few days were brutal, her hands stung from the popped blisters, but she felt empowered. They trained away from private eyes, yet she never felt unsafe in his presence.          It happened on a warm spring afternoon when neither of them had expected it.         A kiss.        ""A well-rounded education isn't complete without a mastery of weapons,"" he teased, adjusting her bow. Her sword work wasn't terrible, but a bow or dagger felt more at home in her hands. Kallias had told her to play to her strengths.       ""You say that as if I'm terrible at the sword."" Philomela couldn't help but rise to his taunt, ""then what does that say about your teaching."" Releasing the arrow, it whipped through the air finding rest in the target.        ""Hmm, I must not be that bad of a teacher if you can hit the target. Just imagine if you were on the battlefield, you would be down right deadly."" His breath ghosted at her ear, as he placed another arrow in her hand.        Already she felt her cheeks warming from his body heat, ""Aim again,"" he continued, obvious to her red face and thumping heart.       ""The first one was pure luck."" Instead of aiming for the target, tilted her head so that his lips were right near her cheek.        Then the bow dropped into the grass as she grasped his face, taking in his surprised expression.        Hazel eyes widened, flushed cheeks, she would say it was a rather good look on him, ""Princess?""       ""Yes?!"" she started to regret having been so bold. The thought had been for nothing their lips inched closer and closer together slowly as if giving her time to stop him.       She didn't.    They were playing a dangerous game, but neither of them realized just how much. She was to be wedded. When she did not know, knowing her father he was glad to be rid of her after his new queen gave him a son.        ""He praised your beauty, I think you will be married come this fall. What do you think, daughter?"" Her father asked, turning to her.        Philomela could have scoffed now he asked her opinion, smothering her displeasure plastered on a smile ""Wonderful, father. I think a wedding held in spring would be much more lovely. Please father, I had hoped for a wedding with the flowers blossoming.""       Menoetius, while thankfully near her age, unnerved her. The last time they met he did little but stare at her-no it was if he was undressing her with his very eyes. It was obvious he would not be a kind husband, hoping she would be obedient in bed and bear his squealing little heirs. If not- the thought brought a chill to her, her only choice was to escape. Time all she needed to do was bid her time.       He considered this, ""Yes you'll be fifteen then, I think another year would not hurt. Surely he can wait for my beautiful Philomela.""        Yes more time for her to wriggle out of this arrangement.        Bowing slightly, to her father, ""Thank you father."" He dismissed her. Bowing one last time, she let her hair hide her expression.        Truly, father.        They had named her sweet singer for nothing. For all that fell from her tongue would be honey glazed poison all she had to do was weave them and like songs they would fall on willing ears.    Words were more powerful than one realized. For the moment words are spoken, they are truths, lies, half-truths,half-lies, songs, poems, ties that bind.        Kallias had damned them both the moment he said, ""Marry me, Mela. Run away with me."" His hazel eyes shining as he cupped her cheek.        ""Be mine and I'll be yours.""       ""I-."" She wanted to tell him that it was foolish, that she couldn't but the words wouldn't come. Not when his love was so earnest.        Yet, the words tumbled so quickly from her lips,""Yes."" All she wanted was to be his and all he wanted was to be hers. If giving up everything for the unknown future was foolish then she didn't want to be rational. Kallias saw her, he saw her heart.       ""Really Mela, my Mela."" By the Gods and she had thought her tongue deadly, he was so open and free with his love.        ""Yes."" She sealed their vow with a kiss.        Promises were easy to make and break but so much harder to keep.     Under the cover of nightfall, she hurried down the steps, he was waiting for her at the entrance of the gate. In a few moments the guards would close the gates. She could only hope that she would make it in time. She would be free.       ""Philomela. Stop this instant."" Her blood ran cold, no it couldn't be. Just as when he had stopped her education, he was going to stop this too. No, no she wouldn't let him. They fought and he slapped her, but she pulled away.       She hurrying to get away from him when suddenly she was pulled back.     He had her by the hair, struggling against his grip she miscalculated the step and suddenly she was falling. Falling, falling, it almost felt like mercy when she finally touched the ground, and darkness took her.       When she awakened, found that awareness came in hazes, everything was hot. Tossing and turning gave her no relief from the heat that seemed to engulf her body. It was scorching, vaguely she felt the cool rags placed at her forehead however it wasn't long before until those too burned like flames.        She was dying, that much she knew was true. All she could pray for was that Hades would take her sooner rather than later.       Yet she didn't die, it had taken weeks to rise from her bed. Weeks of fever and torment. Weeks of laying in the dark wondering what happened to him.       Deep in her heart she already knew, if her father was willing to try to beat her to death then there was no hope for him. By the Gods how she longed to weep, but found that it hurt too much to simply do that.         Mela        One by one tears fell of their own accord.         Mela, I love you.         Run away with me.        It hurt, the agony of it. It was like pouring salt in her already torn and bloodied heart. He was dead but his voice was so clear in his mind. His face, his smile. He was gone. Just gone.    By fifteen, she is married.        Standing at the altar, she blankly stared at her veil. Today is not one of her most lucid days, nor would she have wanted it any other way.        The wedding is a quick and rushed affair, her husband is eager to unveil her. She could tell by the way his greedy hand wretched off her veil. He hadn't even had the decency to wait until the feast.       Philomena didn't even flinch as light flittered into her vision, taking in his disgust at her dull eyes.        She smiled.    At sixteen she becomes a mother.        The child unwillingly placed in her womb. All of her husband's talk of taking lovers had been empty. He stole to her bed when it pleased him and took his liberties as he wished. Even with her mind scrambled, she was lovely enough and men couldn't help but think with their cocks. To exercise what power they thought they possessed over those perceived as weaker than them.        So for months she struggled with pregnancy, wishing for it to end for. For hers and the child sakes, they couldn't be happy living with such a miserable man. Then slowly she began to love the little one in her belly, with them there she didn't feel so alone. Joy began to replace the horror of what had been done to her. All she wanted was to hold her baby, love him or her as much as she was able. She wanted to live if only for the child.        Unlike her own birth, he was quiet for a moment before wailing his displeasure at the coldness of the room. What she could glimpse of him in the midwife's arms he had taken most of her features. Inky curls and her dark skin. Stretching out her arms, she wanted to hold him just this once. If they took him now, she would never hold him again. Menoetius would make sure of it.        One of the midwives moved away and swaddled something, a moment later a pillow was placed in her arms. A pillow, heat built up behind her eyes, a pillow her mind repeated. She could only cradle it in sorrow, a replacement for the baby she would never hold.     Glory to the Father        Patroclus he is named, and then he was whisked away to be raised by nannies and tutors. Philomela wept for days after he was taken, what could she do. She had no way to advocate her sanity which on a day could widely shift, speaking was hard to do as her tongue would not move except to make noise. Vague grunts and moans nothing resembling words, it never ceased to frustrate her. So he grows up away from her.         She rarely ever gets to see him outside scheduled and supervised visits as he is the heir to his father's kingdom. He is the reason that her husband no longer bothers her for another child. Healthy and robust, if a bit thin, but she herself had always been slight. Patroclus favours her, all the court whispers. He does, but she finds he takes more after his grandmother than her completely, as his curls are darker and wilder and his cheeks are higher. However his eyes and freckles are all hers.        Apparently he favors her greatly in how well he does in his studies. He loves mathematics and literature, never before has she been so grateful for gossiping maids. Without them she would never know of her little boy.     At twenty-four.       Her son hates her, and she doesn't blame him for she loves him just the same. How could he ever know the truth, that she was all but trapped in her mind.        It is as if the Gods mock her for on days he does visit. She can do little but smile and blink. Patroclus her son views her with little veiled disgust, no doubt his father's poisoning at work. Yet, he is not cruel to her, for he seems to pity her. They were both at  Menoetius' mercy. Her son more so, her husband beat her son for any little thing, taking out his frustration at having a slow yet beautiful wife. What was the point if she was little more than an empty pretty made up doll. A healthy but in his eyes useless son who focused little on athletics and more time in books.       How she wishes she could have more lucid days, days where she could try to communicate with him, comfort him. So she tries humming to him lullabies her mother once sang to her, and slowly the disgust and pity leave his eyes. He often says little but comes closer to her to rest his head in her lap as she pets his hair. These moments were so precious to her, she wouldn't trade them for the world. Her child, her little Patroclus.       ___________________________________________    On one particular day her son comes to visit her, the Gods are smiling upon her. Her mind feels clear for once so she gestures as well as she can to the window overlooking the shore.       Her clever son understands and together hand and hand they march to the beach. There are servants milling in the background, but she focuses solely on her son.        How his eyes turned to liquid under the Sun's bright rays, she could only marvel at how tall he had gotten. Philomela knelt down for just a moment, there was a flurry of movement behind her to reach her but her son came over first.        ""Mother are you alright?"" She hummed letting him know she was okay. Finishing taking off her sandals let the sand fully sink around her toes, the tide was coming in.        Patroclus joined her and they took in the sunset over the sea, casting everything awash in reds, oranges, and purples.         They stood there for a while until stars began to dot up over the horizon. Her son bowed to her promising to visit her again. She smiled at him.        Of course my son.      Patroclus is eight, and Philomela is dying. There is nothing she can do about it, her time has come. After all her wishing, all she can do is feel regret, regret that she was leaving her son all alone to fend for himself against that heartless monster. Against the world.       Taking her final breath, she prays to any God above that her son would be happy. That is all she could ask for.    Dying isn't painful as people describe it, more like a relief. Nor is the Underworld as dark and gloomy as the stories make of it.        Here she is free. Free to be reunited with her mother and brother.        Free to....       ""  Mela.""     Philomela was meticulous in counting her time since she had come to the Underworld. Everytime a war was mentioned she worried that one day she would see her son among the newly arrived. Even if she was eager to see him again, all she wanted to know was that if he lived a good life, if he had fallen in love, gotten married, had grandchildren. Yet, nothing.       Wars came and went still nothing, yet one day she happened to ask a soldier about the most recent war. The Trojan War that had sent so many young souls to Hades.       ""Excuse me,"" she asked, touching the young man's shoulder. He appeared to be distressed, so many of them came crying or in pain, but he looked up at her dry eyes. So she pressed on, ""Have you heard of Patroclus? Son of Menoetius.""       His whole being seemed to light up, ""Yes, have you seen him? I'm searching for him too."" The young soldier trailed off quietly, ""He should be here....""       She shook her head, ""I only ask because I'm his mother. I have missed him for so long and now I'm finally able to speak to him.""       He appeared to be surprised by her admission, ""Yes, of course how could I have not seen it. You both look so much alike.""       ""Did you know my son well?"" Aha finally someone who knew of her little boy. However if it was true then her son could have very well died in battle.        ""Yes, my lady. I did he was..."" his cheerful demeanor appeared to dim. Before she could lose him she pleaded with him to tell her everything about him.       ""Then would you mind telling me of him. Please."" Even if it was just crumbs she wanted to know him, and then she would hear it all over again when she saw him again.       From the soldier she learned that Menoiteus had exiled him to Pthita for a supposed murder of another boy. Part of her was horrified that he would so cruelly cast out her child only a year after her death. Another part of her was relieved that he had escaped her ex-husband.       ""Was he happy there?"" she asked him.       His emerald eyes twinkled, ""I should hope so. He says the years spent there were his happiest.""       ""I'm glad.""       Then he told of the war, how her son used his skills taught by the great Chiron, trainer to demigods.        ""He saved lives, men who did not expect to see the next day, drawn back from the brink of death. He was admired by many.""       ""What of love? Was he loved?"" At this the soldier's eyes filled with tears.       ""He is loved, this I can promise you. I love him, he is my very soul."" Philomela did not press him for any more stories and the young man sobbed in her arms for what felt like days.        Achilles, she came to know. He had been ashamed to tell her his name for what he perceived as a betrayal to her son. Born a demigod, was her son's lover. She approved, her son had excellent taste. Handsome, polite, and adored the very ground her son walked on. All that a mother could want for her child.       ""I was selfish, I didn't realize what I had until it was too late. I would trade it all if I could see him again hold him again, my lady."" No doubt the Gods had a hand in had occurred most of the wars reeked of a child's chess game.       ""None of this my lady, call me Philomela. My son loves you and I too think of you as my family. Come meet the others, my son has not come yet, but I feel that he will come soon. So come Achilles, he would not want you to sit here and grieve.""       ""My lady, I'm not worthy of your-"" she stopped him grabbing him. What a funny sight they must have made, a waifish woman dragging a full-grown warrior back to where her family waited.       She turned back, giving him what Kallias called her ""you must obey me for you will never win smile."" She hoped Patroclus had at least inherited it.       ""Nonsense, he loves you enough to die for you then we will love you too. There is nothing one can do when he sets his mind to something, none can stop him. I once labored with him for days because he was a stubborn little thing. We will not condemn you nor will he. He loves you.""       ""I-,"" Hmm, he wasn't fully convinced. No matter, she had one last card to play.       ""You have told me your stories, would you like to hear mine?""       ""Stories of Patroclus."" His tone held a wistful longing.        ""He was a very chubby babe, and stubborn too. Did I tell you that I was in labor for days with him...""       Achilles fits nicely in with her family. Kallias took him under his wing, they both spent hours talking strategy and weapons. Her mother cooked for him and her little brother piled his arms with toys. She still went out speaking with the newly dead. Nothing yet.       But she knew more of her son and had his very heart.    Days, weeks, months, and years passed.        Achilles was anxious but she would not tell him just how long it had been.       A millennium or two give or take. She knew it only based on how the newly arrived would speak and dress. Why wasn't her son here? Achilles said they had been buried together but they had not arrived together. All of them had doubts but they dared not speak them around Achilles. The poor dear was already so guilty and grief-stricken. Patroclus had not been buried properly so perhaps that was the delay. Yet she wasn't going to give up hope.       Then one day Achilles startled them all when he suddenly ran off. He truly lived up to his name with those swift feet of his. Philomela followed him as quickly as she could.       At the river, Achilles embraced; a dark skin youth with curly hair. There is only one person whom he would embrace like so.       ""Patroclus,"" she called out, disturbing the couple. Achilles finally let her son's feet touch the ground against. My~my how passionate.       He turned to face her and tears fell. Here was her son all grown up, strikingly tall and slim, their same dark eyes. She now noticed the blood marrying his tunic at the abdomen. A gruesome death, however the signs would fade in time.       Reaching for his hands, noted the rough nature of them. Hands that had saved but also ended lives, her baby.       ""Mother."" His voice was so different compared to its once soft lilt, but he was her son. Finally she could hold her son and this time.       ""I'm sorry-""       ""Ssh, my love,"" drawing him so that he could hear her heartbeat, ""you didn't know you were too young and I couldn't tell you.""       ""I've missed you so much my son and,"" his eyes were damp when she drew back, ""I'm sure you have much to discuss with me. However it has come to my attention that you are keeping a very handsome man waiting. He has been waiting for a long time.""   Not as long as me but he is so grief-stricken just as fresh as the day her son died. His love never wavering, and besides who was she to stand in the way of soulmates.        ""Mother-."" Dare she say he sounded embarrassed.        ""Go on."" She chided all but shoving him into the demigod's arms.        The way they took each other's hands so gently, she startled when Kallias wrapped his arm around her.        ""He favors you,"" he whispered.        ""He does."" Thank the Gods for small mercies, even at his age she could still only see her mother and herself reflected in him.        ""No wonder Achilles is so mad for him. A face of such beauty and kindness few can resist."" She whacked him slightly in the ribs, he coughed a bit.       ""Be nice and if my son is handsome then that is no crime. He is my son so of course he inherited both my good looks and wit.""        ""And besides you're one to talk,"" she added just to make a point. The reunited couple kissed as if they would disappear once more.        ""They're soulmates, tell me you didn't feel it. The way he knew he was coming.""       ""I did, Mela.""       After all these years, she finally had everything. Her family was whole once more(Menoiteus and her father could rot in the very pits of Tartarus for all she cared) and they had welcomed a new addition. She had never wished for power or riches but this. A woman could never wish for more than dutifully keeping house and raising her children. A sentiment she had heard throughout her life. Sure she had a few missteps in her life, but she in her own way had broken the mold.        Happiness.    ";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

""";narrator;third;Adonis;Adonis;;;;;wild pig;wild pig;;;;;hunting accident;wounded by a wild pig;;;;;" Edward was in the attic. He had found a small sack of myrrh resin and was grinding the golden brown lumps in a deep brass mortar. One hand, its fingers traced with faint scars, spread over the mortar to guard the powder he was making, faintly smelling of wood and smoke and sweetness. ""There is a tale,"" he said, ""of the myrhh tree. But it is a sad one.""   Who Weeps?Long ago, poets told a tale that they claimed was a horrible one, that daughters and fathers should hold themselves aloof from or else disbelieve, and further, to believe more strongly in the punishment that followed the sin.  A long time ago there was a girl who fell in love with her father, the king. Are you not shocked? When a man desires his daughter, we sigh and shake our heads, and if we live just lives we punish him - but we are... less surprised than we should be. Even so, here was this girl Myrrha, and she desired her father the king - Cinyras, he was called. Such a desire is unnatural and she knew it well, but she sighed and took to her bed, and swore to her maid that surely she would die. She convinced her maid to help her in the 'bed trick,' to fool old Cinyras that some other fine young lady of good birth desired him. Randy old goat that he was, he consented.  We all know the tale of the monster bridegroom who appears only in the dark, who when a candle is brought is found to be beautiful before fleeing forever. When Cinyras wondered who was this fine youthful lady who wanted him so, who reminded him of his own youth, he brought a candle in the night, and his lover was, indeed, beautiful. In his rage he raised his sword to strike his daughter down and she fled from him. In her shame and her penance, young Myrrha walked nine long months through the dry lands of the Arabs, becoming heavier with child every day. On the last day when she could walk no farther, her mouth parched with thirst, the soldiers of her lover and father still pursuing her, weary of life yet terrified of death, she cried out to Aphrodite the goddess of desire to aid her.  It is an old saying for those who are dismayed by their actions: ""a god must have put the thought in my head"" for the gods of the Middle Sea are capricious and change their minds often. The goddess Aphrodite transformed young Myrrha into a little twisted fragrant tree that split open to reveal the most beautiful baby the goddess had ever seen. She named the baby Adonis, which means Lord, except when it means Perfume, or even Lover. She kept the baby, but shared it with grave Persephone in her dark land for a part of each year. The boy grew and became a man, the most beautiful man, so of course Aphrodite would take him as her lover.  Adonis was fond of the hunt. Bountiful Aphrodite, the postponer of old age, found herself kilting up her gown and running through the woods with her young lover, leaping logs, dodging through the undergrowth and telling the young man who burst with life that by all means he must be careful.  Obviously we all know the ending. She found Beautiful Adonis sprawled beneath a tree, a wild pig snorting over the boy, a spreading wound in her lover's thigh. She wept then as poets weep: for departed beauty, for the fragility of all things, for the idea of the dying god; she wept for worldly cares that Adonis had now left behind him. She wept until her tears and the clotting blood of her lover became the fragile anemone flower, light and frail and quick to die in its beauty.  She weeps, and we weep, for the beautiful Adonis.  But I ask you now - who shall weep for the gnarled and twisted myrrh tree that holds fast in the desert? Who shall weep for a young and silly girl whose tears are fit gift for kings?   Edward ceased his grinding and poured the fine fragrant powder into a wooden bowl, the better to dry in the sun. He breathed in deeply. ""Her tears are beautiful, are they not?""

Corrie Worth, newly widowed, brushed crimson on her lips with a practiced hand, adjusted her hat over graying curls, and lowered the veil. Black gloves, bought at Woolworth's, weren't of the quality usually demanded by the wife of the third-richest mine owner in Harlan County; but sometimes keeping up appearances meant letting down standards.  She stepped into the waiting black Cadillac with the assurance of a woman who'd been driven all her life.  2  Her very first Cadillac had appeared when she was walking to school, barefoot to save her shoes, on a road more stones than dirt.  Looking back at herself with grown-up eyes, she saw an underfed girl who at sixteen looked no more than a city girl's twelve, still in braids, with her calico dress a little too short but no money to replace it. Her mother did miracles, farming the rocky soil and the steep mountainsides, but weather's a fickle friend.  The back door of the Cadillac opened, and Dixon Worth offered her a bag of peppermint candy to get in. She was too stupid with hunger to say no.  3  For Dixon Worth's funeral, the preacher took as his text 2 Corinthians 4:8-9. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.  The slip of a girl on the other side of the church wept with the concentration of a person who's biting the inside of her cheek and thinking about when her dog died.  Corrie would have lent her a veil if they could have admitted to knowing each other.  4  Sheriff J.H. Blair was one of the first to shake the preacher's hand after the service. Corrie suspected she could have danced naked on Dixon's coffin without shaking Blair from his certainty that he'd caught the right men when he jailed those striking miners as murderers.  What will they stoop to next? had become the center of dinner-party conversation among the mine-owning families. A new widow wasn't invited, of course, but word got back to her. This time, they attacked one of us on in the dark. Next, they'll be murdering us in our beds.  A more horrifying idea followed, one that had to be couched in a whisper. Next, they'll be raping our daughters.  Remembering how she'd wed Dixon--trembling and shamed, fearing that she'd made a baby, fearing that she'd incited him somehow--Corrie could almost laugh at fearing the miners.  A black veil hides a widow's unseemly swings of emotion.  5  The girl waited until Corrie had laid her rose on the coffin before she stepped forward with a straggling handful of daisies.  She had the fine features and sinuous movements of a naiad somehow stranded in these coal-rich hills, forced to guard a stream where the mines spewed waste. She might have meant to marry a coal-miner or go to Lexington for factory work or even chase the Hollywood men from the recording companies to get a contract singing songs older than the hills.  For less than a flicker of rain, Corrie's green eyes met the girl's clear blue gaze. The girl mouthed thank you.  6  Corrie had guessed when she found the pink lipstick on Dixon's silk handkerchief, but she hadn't cared until word got back through the servants that little Araminta Sizemore had tried slicing her wrists.  She'd sent a pair of cream-colored gloves--the good ones, from the shop in Lexington--with a message written small and folded into one finger.  7  Her own nightmares about miners involved hanged men, ropes still around their necks, accusing her. Once Dixon's safely in the ground, she'll turn to Sheriff J.H. Blair for comfort, and he'll mysteriously lose the keys to the jail, just long enough for the miners to escape. Their lives won't be worth much in Harlan County, but that's nothing new.  The thought of Blair sweating and grunting atop her nauseated Corrie, but it wasn't not right that any more people suffer for Dixon's sins.  8  Peppermint tea, so refreshing was the murmur among guests at the house after the funeral. Talking about Dixon's murder wasn't proper, not in front of his widow.  9  Raising the pick over her head had taken all Corrie's strength, but the wet, crushing noise when it entered Dixon's head had made the effort worth it.";;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;0;1;1;0;semantic
31797934;"""Thus at last by Dionysus’ command and the Maenad’s hands, he was torn limb from limb, split in two and three and four and ever smaller parts."" [...] ""They ate his innards still steaming hot and raw, they gnawed his flesh down to the bone and wolf cubs carried the bones away.""";narrator;third;Pentheus;Pentheus;;;;;Maenad;Maenads;;;;;tearing to pieces;torn limb from limb;;;;;" ""Young women, I've brought you the man who laughed at you, who ridiculed my rites. Now punish him!"" said Dionysus.   The Maenads, mad with rage at the violation of their sacred gathering, shook the tree, upon which that royal intruder sat, so hard that Pentheus fell out of it like an apple from the branch. He rolled downhill, the women were at his heels, then he jumped to his feet and ran like the hare, dashing wildly through the forest, breaking brambles and treading thorns. His white robes, which had disguised him as one of them, fluttered like a flag in the wind and not far behind him were the Maenads, running fast like jaguars, some on two feet and some on four, all in varying states of undress. They laughed feverishly and their animal howling and screeching echoed behind him, all throughout the forest; everywhere the Maenads came after him like hounds after the fox.  Out of the bramble and the thorns, Dionysus appeared in Pentheus' path. Sweet were his lips but dark his eyes, such as the gazes that lovers share in the night. ""Halt,"" he said and Pentheus stopped, held on the spot, unable to will his body any other way. ""There is that great stag, who is straying in our fields. That stag shall be my sacrifice,"" said Dionysus.   Hearing his call, the group of Maenads came rushing to him, approaching from all sides, encircling their rare catch. Trapped and desperate, Pentheus spun in a circle around, pleading with the women who approached him slowly now like the cat sneaking up on the mouse. ""Do you not see who I am? Underneath these robes woven with gold it is I, Pentheus, your son, your kin, your master, your king!"" He tore his headdress away, revealing himself, and some of them recognized him and some of them did not. His mother Agave saw a lion with firm loins, some saw a stag with heavy antlers, others saw a wild boar and others did see him as he was, but too great was their lust for him and their righteous anger to change their paths.   ""Spoil him,"" said the twice-born Semeilos. His voice was a terrible whisper in the trees.   Dionysus, who breaks the chains, bestowed upon those women that, which nature had not allotted to them. He gave them the strength of beasts and the power to mend their bodies into shapes fit for their lecherous purpose. At his behest, one took her thyrsus and touched it to her loins and such transformed them into those of a man. Another followed her example but the lean girl became like a hound and another one rough and heavy-set became like a bull.  The three transformed came running on all fours like the hungry wolves and behind them followed the rest of the Maenads, dancing and singing and screaming with joy. The first of the women jumped on Pentheus as he lay prostrate, pleading at the smiling god's feet. By his power, her fingers turned into talons and she ripped the fine dress off Pentheus' back, revealing the proud warrior's body to eyes red with hunger and rage. Terrifying Pentheus trembled fearfully. He pressed his lips hotly to Dionysus's feet, kissing them in all too late reverence, but no begging would move the avenger to mercy.   Wanton with rage like the bulls freed of their tethers, the half-woman pulled Pentheus back into their midst and onto all fours, into the embrace of beasts. From behind she mounted him and he cried out, for it was the first time he had been used such and she used him cruelly like men use their slaves, finding his virginal clench a thing most pleasant to break. And break he did, whimpering undignifiedly, when she had her fill and then came the next, the dog and the bull and the boar and the horse and the bear, all hermaphrodite creatures with the loins of male beasts and the sweet laughter of women bellowing from their heaving breasts.   Turning him over from one to the other like the drinking cup, they mounted cruelly, they kissed greedily, they scratched, they bit, they tore, and they spilled. Soon they drew blood from him, tearing like skewers into the lees of his belly. Blood was only incense to their frenzy and all greater became their brutality and the greater his cries. One, all human was she, bit his neck, blunt teeth crushing and grinding like millstones. Another took his arm and twisted it behind his back until it broke in three parts and hung slack and useless from the socket. Another drew her thyrsus, slick with honey, over his belly. Where it touched, the skin split in two like an overripe fruit, spilling dark red wine and clear clotted milk, drenching wet the ground below their feet. The last one grabbed him by the stones, pulled until they came off and swallowed them whole. Pentheus' eyes rolled in their sockets like those of the sweet heifer on the altar of sacrifice; twisting and turning, he screamed and screamed.  Dionysus stood unmoving. ""How you dance now, how you laugh,"" said he, ""are these not the reveries you sought to see? Oh, dear cousin, you shall enjoy my hospitality."" At once, the Maenads, bloodied, dirty, and panting with lust, withdrew in a circle around Pentheus, who lay in a trembling heap of tatters. Then as if pulled up by a string he rose from the pool of his blood, upright and the neck stretched like a crane. Moving his fingers left and right in uncharted gestures, Dionysus made him dance beautifully. Pentheus threw his limbs left and right and his broken bones cracked the tune. The rags of his dress that hung off his body followed each move and so did his innards when disturbed by the motions they came spilling from the cleft in his stomach like flower garlands swaying in the wind. The blood splashed up high from under his soles, like water from a puddle after the rain, and mad now with pain, he foamed from the mouth.  ""Look how he shakes and trembles. Listen to the moans of his ecstasy,"" said Dionysus and all that he said was true, because he willed it so that Pentheus' pain was also pleasure, two currents of water flowing from the same source. Pentheus danced, he laughed, and he cried and in that moment he saw up the river and in the currents of his own flesh, what no one had seen before him; Dionysus Mystes in his manifold forms, ever devouring and ever devoured, tearing and torn, the ceaseless hunger of the world, and he saw himself in the god's jaws, man and woman alike, moaning with pleasure as the teeth ground him to red and white gruel.  Thus at last by Dionysus' command and the Maenad's hands, he was torn limb from limb, split in two and three and four and ever smaller parts. The young women wreathed themselves crowns of his guts, entwining them with flowers upon their heads and the old ones drenched their greying hair in his blood as though it were the sweetest myrrh. They ate his innards still steaming hot and raw, they gnawed his flesh down to the bone and wolf cubs carried the bones away. Only his head remained in one piece; his mother Agave carried it as a trophy back to Thebes, where he was born. Meanwhile, the Maenads fell asleep in the embrace of the forest, nestling up to each other like kittens after a good meal.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;1;0;0;0;semantic

But I failed, he has been dead for years, and I am a god.   ""You can't beat me, you know"" I said, smiling. He took it as a challenge and laughed. His laugh was melodic. Beautiful and positive. Like him. Happy, amazing, beautiful. He wore a white toga, draped over his tan skin. And hair as brown as wood, as pretty as nature.   We were in a sunny field playing, as we both loved sports. He grabbed a diskus. ""Watch me"", he said teasingly. He threw the diskus into the air. It landed far, but not far enough to beat a god. He smiled, baiting me to join the game. He smiled as radiant as the sun, pure as fresh water. I loved him.   His eyes twinkled as I took the diskus.   ""We'll see""   I laughed and grabbed the diskus. I threw it into the air, so fast it was almost scattering the clouds. He ran laughing to catch it. He should have gotten it, but in those last moments it felt like years.   My heart stopped. So did his. A slight change in the wind destroyed everything. Instead of catching the diskus,it hit his head. Blood trickled from his head. He fell like icarus, he fell like the setting sun, he fell like the rain, he fell like the tears from my eyes.He hit the ground, and I ran to catch him. I held him in my arms, watching the blood fall from his beautiful head. I held him, hugging him, as he left this world. It pains me to recall. I tried everything. Everything. Magic, all forms of healing. But I could not bring him back. Me, the god of healing, failed.   I cupped his cheeks and sobbed. I failed. I have failed.Words of consciousness fell from my lips, but none could capture my sadness. Behold the blood of Hyacinthus, which had poured out on the ground from his head and stained the grass, and it changed from blood;   and in its place a flower, more beautiful than royal phonecian, was born. Almost seemed like a lily, were it not that one was purple and the other white. But I was not satisfied with this. If he should leave, he would leave a trail of his happiness. I worked the magic of my sadness on flower leaves. These letters AI, AI, are inscribed on them.  The sounds of my crying when he fell shall be inscribed in the flower.   The sun sets and it darkens. I kissed him for the last.   Goodbye, Hyacinthus. I love you.  The sun rests.   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)   (tw: mentioned non con)not detailed))  There was a girl, and there was a god, and there was me. The god is Eros, the god of love. The girl was Daphne, a river nymph whose beauty could rival Aphrodite's herself. And I was the god of the sun, amongst many other things. One of those was Archery.   I saw Eros with his bow and arrows, preparing for his job. That day I was mad, as I had lost a match with my sister, Artemis. Eros was hiding behind a tree, watching a couple in the woods. ""Ah-ah-ah, what are you doing with those weapons, don't you think its too powerful for you?"" I said, smirking. Eros however, did not think that was funny. He scowled. ""That equipment of yours doesn't even fit you. Those weapons are for those who have power, as I have just slain the Python, whereas you will be content to provoke some loves by your arrow."" I look back on it and I realize that may have not been the best thing to do.   Eros may be the god of love, but with love comes heartbreak.  The insulted god glared at me through his eyes. He hadnt said anything, he just walked away.  I should have not thought he would let me go.   The god of love then prepared two arrows, as i have learnt. One of gold, was of lead. For the god of love, he was filled with hatred. He shot the golden arrow at me, and the lead to a river nymph, Daphne. Those arrows were magic, shot after each other, would become connected. Gold arrows bring out all the love you could ever have for a person to exist, lead arrows are the opposite. Lead arrows bring out all the hatred you have for a person to the surface. When those arrows are intertwined, so are you.  I met Daphne as i was walking in the woods. There was something within me, something embedded in my soul. A voice whispering in my head, driving me mad with desire to enter this woods. Maybe I was possessed. Somewhere in me drove me to the place deep in the woods, where I first saw her. The only time I have felt this love was with Hyacinthus. Maybe that was a clue that this would end in failure. My failure.  She was sitting on a rock, making a bow. Scrape scrape, went the blade, her delicate hands hold it as she carved. I could have watched her all day, for it not she have noticed me. She looked up and her eyes met mine. Whereas mine was filled with pure, pure, pure, lust, but hers filled with rage, and pure hatred. Her piercing eyes met mine, and I, the god of many things, a god whom has fought many monsters, but i have never seen such hatred as i saw in her eyes. Like a rake, seeing my future, my past, and my present. Combing my soul, seeing the dark parts. Seeing what I will do to her.  I regret what i have done, but at that time-- i would not be swayed. I followed her relentlessly, I chased her, not stopping. I wanted her, I intended to have her. But if i had truly loved her I would have let go. Is it love if I had loved her, i would have dedicated my life to her, but i caused her destruction. I should have let her go. But instead i chased her.  I left her no choice, and she sacrified her life to turn into a tree. She prayed to the god Peneus, and he took mercy, and now she is lost forever. Leaving me, just as Hyacinthus had. Both my fault. If only I didnt fight Zephyros, if only i didnt fight Eros, she might have loved me. I laid on the ground of the tree, weeping. I might died with such pain, different from the sinking numbness of Hyacinthus, the poison of his death seeping into my heart. But this was different, a different pain. It was like a sharp knife, my guilt melded into a knife, stabbing me many times with no mercy. A parallel to what i have done. No mercy.   Is this the guilt and sorrow that makes mortals die?  If i could, i would. But thats ridiculous. I could not die. I would live on, each passing moment with grief for my two loves. I pray to Daphne for her forgiveness.   I dared Zephyros, the West Wind, who also loved Hyacinthus. I dared him to take him away from me. My greed caused his death.  I taunted Eros, and my mockery of him is what drove Daphne to her death.  The stories say i chased her on whim, that she was just another pretty face. The stories are wrong. When she became a tree, i could feel part of my heart turn into bark as well.   She became a laurel tree, and i took her leaves and crafted a wreath--- the laurel wreath. Funny---the laurel wreath was made from failure, my failure, yet it is given to heroes for their victory. Each time some hero wins, it reminds me i failed.  I caused the death of them.  I knelt at the ground.  ""Forgive me""  The sun rests.  (hi so i realized since this is from apollo's pov, it may seem like its romanticizing this---- which, no. thats not what i mean to do. I do not think actions like this is okay. Do not do this. Respect people's boundaries. I tried to make it as not detailed as possible as i do not agree on anyone that these actions are okay. I do not mean to romanticize anything.)(this is different from Hyacinthus and Apollo, as Hyacinthus apparently loved him too.)(its just the daphne/apollo thats non/con (including apollo's other lovers.... Yeah its... just.. yeah.)DONT do r@pe)  In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book I: Apollo and Daphne, Ovid uses animals to make the emotions of characters more relatable to the reader. Ovid characterizes Apollo's pursuit for Daphne as more animalistic than human, and creates the metaphor of a predator and its prey to show the connection between the two. Ovid writes, ""sic agna lupum, sic cerva leonem, sic aquilam penna fugiunt trepidante columbae,"" meaning,   ""Thus a young lamb flees the wolf, thus the doe flees the lion, thus the dove flees the eagle, wing trembling.""   Each animal that is being preyed on is fleeing from its predator, and in each case the predator is as the stronger animal. The word ""fugere"" shows the urgency about and genuine fear of the predator. Ovid uses the word ""fugiunt"" in the present tense, showing that the prey is still fleeing its predator.(so theres clearly alot wrong with apollo and daphne, and i point out i dont want to romanticize it. I hope i explained this.)  Dont chase after people when they say no";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;1;0;0;0;semantic

O the veins in my wings sing! (Dies.)""";direct speech;first;Hyacinthus;Hyacinthus;;;;;---;discus;;;;;discus;struck by the discus;;;;;" Hyacinthus' Song   Hyacinthus: (Alone on stage) I am lucky over all men, for I am beloved of the sun. On me his eyes delight --his darling, his lovely one. I cannot wait till he comes back again -- I'm up, dressed, waiting now, though it's still night. He's promised me the second sight and taught me many things: Music of strings, of spheres and, now and then, of numbers. How could I stay in bed and sleep till day, when in my head all this is going 'round like the sound of flies' wings?  Flies' wings? Funny way to talk of a god and his favours, but all the same, they do go 'round, my thoughts, and hum an insect tune, some strain not in a major key or a happy vein. I know this can but end in ill. I do not need his gift to tell that it can't last. When the Fates cast me to him they did not mean well. For he is a thing of gold; light runs in his veins; while I must grow old, he cannot change. What will he do, poor god, when I am gone and he remains? Will Earth wake up some day frozen cold? Or will days cease, when I am gone? Or will he carry on?  Perhaps it will not end like that. Perhaps, some bright day, he will find me dull and cold to him. Perhaps his love for me with time will dim. For he is bright day, merciless to age; a man might love a mayfly, or a cricket in a cage, soon as a god love a mortal. Should I leave him then? Where could I hide from that piercing eye? I'd be found out -- and to face him, when he looked in doubt at me, and sighed, and asked me why?  Although I know this can't go on, I sit here, waiting for the dawn to bring the love I soon will lose, my fair shining one.   (Enter Apollo)   Apollo: Sweet flowering mortal lad, welcome the light! Hyacinthus: Love? Apollo: Even in heaven, how the nights are drear, but now that morn unveils the earth to sight and with it you, my own -- why, heaven is here! Hyacinthus: Lord! Apollo: Don't kneel. Fear not the warmth of my embrace. These arms shall hold you close -- don't tremble so -- Hyacinthus: O God! Apollo: These fingers comb the hair back from your face... Hyacinthus: O your mouth... Apollo: and make room on your brow, for my lips to go... Hyacinthus: Your eyes are so bright. Apollo: To look upon you, dear, is all my joy. Hyacinthus: I waited for hours till you came. Apollo: Such a soul, to such a body framed -- A god might love here without fear of shame. Hyacinthus: O calm my heart, cradle my head, for I am afraid. Apollo: Why, what is wrong, my own dear lovely boy? Hyacinthus: You move so fast love, that my poor feet will never keep up to you. I'll be left behind. Apollo: I had forgotten you were human. Beat calmer, heart of flesh; poor mortal sweet.  Apollo: Come here. My strength I'll gentle, not to crush your weakness. Harm will never come to you while you are in my arms. I know I must take care with you. Why are your eyes shut? Is my face too bright? Hyacinthus: No. I am sad; I don't know why. The air is bearing down on me, and the grasshoppers whine like a headache coming on. I wish it would rain! Apollo: It is not right for such a lovely face to look so dismal. Just say the word, and we'll go anywhere you like.      Geography song   Apollo: I'll open up my treasure-box of lands, and you can count the cities up like precious stones; In this one sea alone, just count the islands: see how they sparkle like foam. Seek out some nest, my soft seabird, or roam the waves from harbour rocks to beachy sands, making each new spot in turn your home. I know you like buildings, and books: Th'Egyptians have wonderful architecture; libraries; sphinxes; colossi that moan in the dawn; But their river (tho' noble) is sluggish and green and their weather too dusty and hot -- I prefer cooler climes. Do you like to look down from great heights? There are views to be seen. Listen! I know of a plain where long ago, people gathered to build. With stout ropes, they herded huge stones to the spot: A feat great as the Pyramids, surely! For though not so high nor so straight as your temples, the rock pillars loom to this day where those old folk set them; and still each year I pierce that hall to the heart. Further west? Everywhere I am welcome, No passport required. New York hiding in fog and smoke boasts not to sleep, but when I step ashore I can see how I've been sorely missed, for the people all rub their eyes, newly-awoken, surprised; What is their neon dark, compared to my gold on the leaves in the park? Or if you prefer a crisper clime Take in Canada's sharp outlines; Bright and hard as its stones is the air off the seas and the rivers and lakes. You can see in the cities, the mountains. The breeze from the high tundra colours the cheek of Ontario peach and Annapolis pear. On an island live strange birds, and tortoises as big as mixing vats or banquet dishes. I shine on them, receive their wordless homage, for 'tis what you humans call deserted -- but you could be the first man if you wish, As 'tis with you and you alone the time I'd while away, in any jewelled garden on the whole Earth's jewelled isle.  Hyacinthus: It's not that I'm ungrateful to you, but there are some things immortals just can't know. You don't understand -- Time's not the same for me as 'tis for you. The clock that ticks inside me will ring out no matter the land. I have no demand.  Apollo: No demand? I command, I entreat you to ask for a wish. Where's the task I would not do for you? I must make you some gift, little butterfly -- lift up your eyes and take heart. Ask me. Why won't you ask?  Hyacinthus: (aside) This is what I saw. This morning, I knew, would be our last. (aloud) And what would I ask for? You've always said you wouldn't want me any other way -- And I don't want a change; what's left, I pray? I don't want toys. It only shames us both for you to offer them. I just love you. Please just love me. Let's forget. Life's too short for this sort of mistake. No, it's a fine day for... for sport.  Apollo: Dear simple Hyacinth! Is that all you want? Your wish is my command, my child. Shall I show you how to throw the discus? For I know your heart is mild; you'd rather play at hunting prey of bronze than shoot the wild deer.  Hyacinthus: (aside) I know what you're all thinking: ""Why not ask for immortality, little fool?"" But you see, I know him -- while he knows so much, he forgets. I'm a mortal, and know the rules. The luckiest man in the world can have life, or youth -- not both. It's not a choice I'm keen to make: To be Endymion, beautiful sleeping piece of meat? or Tithymus, dead stick with a soul inside? Besides, he'd get bored. The gods cheat on each other; no blame, so do we, often, and we live only a few dozen years with our loves. No, I've made up my mind: I'll take as much happiness with him as I may, and never grudge my fate.      The Death of Hyacinthus   Hyacinthus: (struck by the discus): O red! I'm not drunk, so why does my head turn round so heavily and my sight spin a spiderweb over my eyes and I'm lying on the ground and each sound is magnified thousands of times My heart clutches as it climbs and the breath in my throat stops solid and still, as the colours so shrill of the world strike the light's note my watery limbs float away... O my flying eyes! O the veins in my wings sing! (Dies.)  Apollo: Please O please darkness let me mourn in black; should've been the night sky I should've been the moon, curled-up stillborn In darkness I wouldn't have seen him And I wouldn't have loved, wouldn't have seen him die.  No breath, no more a breath, no pulse, no tremor, no sighs, not a thread of air, never an eyeball's flicker or a heartbeat's stammer. Summer's cut at the root and severed.  O he was life itself! You glutton, death, you swallower, to take the whole warm world in one gulp. Lick your lips and smile, and lap me up too, eclipse, before I take another breath...      Apollo's Song   I never saw you; never saw you, dear. I was dazzled by your looks as by a mirror. All-seeing, I -- I never thought of what might lie behind your pretty shining eyes. You reflected. I did not. Pinned down with lofty speech, I thought I had you where I knew the angles, called the shots -- Glare blinded me. My aim was off, untrue. I fixed my eyes and I broke you.      Finale   Apollo: Your path has curved away from mine, you spiral into blackness like a spark; while I must keep my circle's course, and never know the dark.  I cannot follow on that path. I must stay here and keep the watch's light, through rounds of tired revolving days till I catch up the night.  The prisoner blood within you, love, I freed, albeit most unwillingly. It wriggles bright across the ground, escapes into the leaves.  While I lie bound in my own rays, Outstripped by your emancipated hour, I'll spend my hard eternity in mourning for a flower.

Before I ask what happened, someone grabbed my hair harshly and said, Ajax killed all cattle and lambs then fled.  ""He's gone now, so you're the one who should pay.""  ""Die, you traitor!""  My mind was hazed. I was busy escaping death. Yes, soldiers try to crush me with rocks. When I nearly lay on the land and breath heavily, old kings stopped them. I remember Idomeneus get me up and head to the council. Sons of Atreus denounced me roughly but when Calchas put his hands on my shoulder and whispered, his words are all I concerned about.  ""My son, Fate is not doomed yet. You still have time, but you must move fast.""  ""He's alive?""  ""Yes, but hurry before fates take him.""  He swift me and I ran. No, sons of Atreus blocked me. I need to go, I demand them to let me go but they said I can't. They accused me that I'm a traitor. They said me and my brother planned to kill kings and leave Troy with treasures. I was nervous to imagine losing Ajax and was desperate to go find him, so I sent Alastor instead. After sending him first, I got out of the camp as quickly as I could and ran. My breath gets heavier and sharp pain stabbed my lungs.  Finding Ajax wasn't difficult. I heard Tecmessa's shrill cry from the shore. All my hope shattered poorly. Fates took him.  I cried a lot. I didn't know how to stop crying at that time. Friends told me that I was almost passed out when I first saw his corpse. They help me get up and expect orders from me. At first, I didn't know what to do. I look around and notice Eurysaces isn't here. I gasp. Breath sharply, I almost shouted.  ""Where's Eurysaces?""  Tecmessa quickly takes her son here, where her husband and her child's father lay. My brother's corpse. While my friends told me what happened during my absence, all my mind was fixed on Tecmessa and Eurysaces. I can't take my eyes off from them. To see them crying makes my heart hurt.  ""Did he leave any will?""  ""...Ajax said you will be the child's protector. He wanted you to take him to Salamis. To king Telamon,"" Pandion said.  To Salamis.  ""I see. Anything else?""  Pandion shakes his head. So, that's all. Duty has fallen.     It's a hard thing to take care of a child. Especially after a battle. Every time I go out for battle, I fear that I could die immediately even before leaving my will. After my brother's death, I pray to the gods every day. I wasn't faithful before but things changed.  I must be safe until I took Tecmessa and her child to Salamis. Protecting a woman and child during this endless war is a hard quest. There are many enemies in here, in our ally. Taunt, despise, rape, disregard, assault, I know these very well. They were never stranger during my childhood. After all those years, I still remember everything so vividly. How can I forget? But the child in front of me, and the woman who's sick right now are in a worse situation than mine. And I should protect them. Not just because it's Ajax's will, but I wanted to since I first saw them.  Eurysaces, the child who has such beautiful curly hair, soft hands and feet, blushes on his cute cheeks, and has such shining eyes, and a cheerful voice. His every expression, his every act, every word are precious. I wasn't his father but I love him, truly. How can a person hate and give no love to children? But sadly, I know and experienced them. My father, and the adults I met... some of them tried to hurt me and my own father just sit his golden throne and watched. He never helped me even when I kneel before him and begged with tears. He won't greet me and won't forgive me when I go back to Salamis. He will blame me and might order exile. No, he will.  Take him to Salamis, to our father Telamon.  Telamon always hated me and will curse me when I return to Salamis. I dare not wish his love for I'm a bastard and also slave-born. I think about Eurysaces. I can't certain but I think he will love Eurysaces. He's different. Eurysaces is his grandson, and he's Ajax's child... He deserves every love from his grandfather. Telamon should be, for the boy isn't a hateful child like me. I draw a picture of Telamon treating him kindly. By imagining this, my heart gets more comfort than before.  Now the child closed his eyes. Tecmessa is sick today, and also she hadn't slept well this week. I should lay him in my bed and sleep tonight. At first, the boy looked awkward when he should left his mother for some time. Sure he is. But after hours later he is now tired from playing and Hypnos slowly invite the young boy to his realm. Soon Eurysaces will sleep in my arms. I hope. For I'm also tired.  I brush his hair softy. Little child, my darling nephew. I never saw a pure creature than him. The day I hold his little body when he was a baby, that memory will never fade away.  ""I promise there will be no harm to you,"" I whispered faintly, try not to bother his sleep.  I swear to gods that I will always protect Eurysaces and Tecmessa, make no one can harm them. Even I, who might lose myself just as Ajax did. I begged to the gods have love and mercy for us.  Gods, let him never experience what I went through. Let him never understand the pain I experienced. Let Tecmessa won't be raped again, let her live in peace until her death. Let Eurysaces protect his mother just like his name when he becomes a grown man, unlike me.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule

""No.""  Apollo was flustered and more than a little angry. This is the first time I have refused him. I could never refuse my brother, but in this matter, what he wanted to do, I had to say no.   Help me. I need to know what Cinthus's fate is. Please help me.     I will not help you with this. In fact, I need you to promise that you will never seek out knowledge of his destiny.    My brother grew puce.   Why?     What would you do if you had that knowledge, hmm? Hunt down all those who wish to hurt him? Spend every moment fretting over gathering shadows and unseen enemies? Waste what precious time you have with him?     He could be gone tomorrow by dawn! This very hour! I need to know!   No! I push him back and use my powers to stop him from leaving. It really hurt, but I had to do it. I will not let you do it. Phoebus!  He stopped, his breath coming out all ragged and harsh. I have never seen my brother behave like this where anyone else was concerned. That look in his eyes, that anguish, that desperation, it was as if Hyacinthus was-  Your other half? My hands go to my mouth. Is he your soul's other half?  The way he looked at me. How is this even possible? We were Gods. A soul's other half should not exist for us, but this was a matter for another time. Right now, I had to stop him from doing something reckless and foolish.    Apollo, you must not go to the Fates. They have not forgotten that stunt you pulled with Hermes. Remember? When the two of you got them drunk so that you could meddle with Admetus' fate? The crones do not forget such acts; they will only plague you with riddles and half-truths, leading you by the nose, just to get back at you.    That got to him, I think. Sensing the futility of his cause, my brother collapsed onto a stool and buried his hands in his hair.   I am afraid, sister. I have this feeling in me that this is not going to last much longer.     Can you not see it?    I crouch next to him and try to peer into his thoughts. Anything connected to Cinthus and his future faded abruptly into nothingness. Someone very powerful was preventing us from seeing. The Fates, no doubt, already getting back at my brother for what he did. My throat tightened. I peered into the bedroom, and my eyes actually stung. Cinthus was not going to be with us for long.  Apollo shook his head. Every time I get close, it feels like a great wall drops in front of me to stop me from seeing beyond. He looked at me, his eyes filled with golden tears. What do I do? Should I tell him?  No. Cinthus will always be looking over his shoulder. Let him enjoy the most of what little time he has left. My brother nodded in agreement. As for what you could do? Love him. I said. Maybe he truly has only one hour left on this earth, and how do you want to spend that hour? Fretting over every shadow or making the most of every last second with him?  My brother looked like he had decided. I will not seek out the Fates. It is all right, sister, you can go now.  First things first. But only after you swear an eternal vow to not interfere with his fate.   Sister...   Swear it! I held onto his arm and refused to let go. Swear that you will not meddle!  My brother sighed, his shoulders slouched in defeat. Help me with the words then.  I did it carefully, leaving nothing to chance. Apollo winced as he repeated every word I said, for there were no weaknesses for him to find, no crack to wriggle through. Finally, we were done, and a silvery star gleamed in the centre of his chest. Go. I heard sheets rustling, a body stirring, lips forming my brother's name. He searches for you.   Is Hyacinthus truly not long for this world?   Hermes was here, and he, too, was upset. Over the past few months, we had both come to see Hyacinthus as a brother of sorts, our newest comrade. The knowledge that he would not be with us for much longer was too much for even me to bear. Yes. I put an arm around my half-brother. But do not say a word. Let them enjoy what little time they have left together.  For once, Hermes sniffed and made a vow not to gossip.  Finally, spring surrendered to summer. My birthday dawned bright, crisp, and hot. Father threw a feast after we had made the necessary sacrifices for the Gods.  Many came up to wish me, with just as many asking when I hoped to marry, asking if I would like to be introduced to the noble maidens they knew. I politely refused, and when they turned to my father, he simply said, if he's not interested, then he's not interested. Many were confused by this, but the others, older and much wiser, understood without having to be told further. They bobbed their heads and went back to eating and drinking.  The mid-morning feast had been splendid, as was the private dinner mother had planned for when the twins and Hermes dropped by.  Hermes was very well behaved, although that could have been due to the vow he swore, promising not to make off with anything that belonged to us. He stretched out by the fire while I opened my presents.  First, there was a beautiful bow, with gold inlay that gleamed in the light. This was from Artemis, and the quiver was filled with sleek arrows. They all bore the mark of Hephaestus, and I would neither miss nor run out of arrows. Next was a box of rare coins from Hermes, from countries as far off as Taprobane and even further than that, from a land famous for its silk.  ""My lord?"" I pointed to the crest on the box. It had been taken from someone else. Hermes' reddened cheeks were proof of it. I grinned and accepted it all the same. Hermes was who he was. Nothing was going to change that.  Then there were the traditional gifts from my parents, given to all Spartan men on their twenty-first birthday. A traditional Spartan helmet with a horsehair plume that had been stiffened and dyed a deep rich red, a shield and spear. I would now carry these if we went to war again. Poly gave me a bracelet she made herself, then made herself content talking to Artemis.  When he and I were alone, Apollo gave me the most beautiful aulos I had ever seen, something he had fashioned with his own hands. We then lay down on the balcony of my room, under the stars, with him pointing out those that were made immortal by the Gods.  ""Herakles,"" he pointed to a constellation. ""Athena herself brought him to Olympus. He now guards the gates to our realm.""  And Apollo was the one that set the twelve labours on him, so he could atone for murdering his family. ""And that?""  ""Kheiron,"" the centaur of legend. ""Father brought him to Olympus to teach his growing brood.""  ""He died just after the Trojan war, didn't he?"" I rested my head on his chest, my heartbeat slowing down with every breath he took. ""I heard he taught Herakles and Achilles.""  Apollo flinched. ""My love? Is something wrong?""  ""It is the reminder of Achilles. I pushed Patroclus off the wall."" Apollo sighed. ""Patroclus tried to scale the walls of Troy. If he had, it would have roused the Argives into pushing through.""  Apollo looked ashen from what he had done. ""I pushed him off the wall, stripped his armour off of him. Made it easy for Hector to kill him. It was cowardly, I see it now. Patroclus fought bravely, and with honour. He deserved a better death.""  I just listened. The Gods had a direct role in the war, and to hear something resembling regret from one of them... ""I sided with the Trojans. Father's orders. He favoured the Trojans and wanted to support them. I was given clear orders. And I followed them. And Troy still fell."" Apollo sighed and raised my hands to his lips. ""All of that grief because Paris could not keep his hands off Helen. She is there too,"" he pointed to the sky. ""With Menelaus.""  According to legend, it was she who went with Paris willingly. Artemis said it was actually Paris who abducted a very unwilling Helen.  ""Was she happy after that? Helen?""  ""Traumatized would be a better word."" Apollo ran his hand over my chest, his breath hitching when mine went over his thigh. ""And she cursed Paris till the day she died.""  He carried me to bed after that, our hands and lips going over the bumps and lines that had become so dear to us. It was well past midday when he finally left.  The memory came back again, this time sharper and clearer than before.  It was in Troy, with the Argives being slaughtered after Father dropped the scales to honour a debt he owed Thetis. The smell of steel, flesh, and burning wood filled my lungs, and that voice in the darkness grew clearer now. This time I could see fired gold hair whipping in the wind, and sea green eyes spitting fire and malice at me.    ""But I swear, here and now, a time will come when all your hopes will dash to the ground, and your joy will become like ash in your mouth. A time when your dreams will burn to cinders and all that you have longed for will come to nought. When that day comes, I will drink to your suffering.""   I opened my eyes with a start. I never bothered with the ravings of angry mortals, but this, this settled in my heart like a flame.    A time will come when all your hopes will dash to the ground, and your joy will become like ash in your mouth.   Hyacinthus. My joy, now sleeping safely in my arms. What will I do when I lose him?  I remembered my sister's words and fought back the feeling of gloom growing in my heart. Whatever amount of time I had with him, I would make the most of it.  Three days later, I went to the marketplace to meet some friends. When the west wind picked up and dust whirled around us like angry bees, I was joking with them, listening to their stories, their loves and losses, and how we planned on competing for the games. I picked up the scent of something strange.  ""Prince of Sparta.""  The voice was ugly, and the words came out in hisses, like rough winds whipping around jagged mountain peaks. It had to come from a God, and only one God had ties with the west wind. My friends made their excuses and left.  ""My Lord Zephyrus,"" I said, bowing as deeply as I could. ""Would you care for some refreshment? some libation? Perhaps I could take you to the palace, so you could rest?""  ""None of that."" His voice was rather like the wind of a hurricane. ""I wish for your company.""  The tone of his voice set my teeth on edge and made the hairs on the back of my neck stand.  ""How may I be of service to you, my lord?""  He seemed to leer at me, and I did not like it one bit. I sent a quick prayer to the twins, hoping one of them would hear.  Zephyrus cocked his head to the side and said, ""You will serve me. Or do you need plainer words than that?""  I understood fully. Some Gods were like this, never asking, only demanding, or simply taking.  ""You flatter me with your attention,"" I put on my best simpering voice, to soften the blow to his ego. ""Truly.""  ""B-but?"" Zephyrus said in a huff.  He would not appreciate it if I refused him, but I must. I could not bear the thought of being with anyone other than Apollo.  ""I must decline. I am already promised to another, and will not betray them.""  ""I know who it is. You reek of him, that Olympian prig,"" he spat in disgust. ""Come with me, young man. I will show you a much better time than him.""""My answer is no."" I stood up to him, my spine straight. ""I belong to Apollo and no other. Kindly leave me, my lord, and trouble me no further.""  Zephyrus advanced on me, the wind whipping at his hair in a rage. I guess no one had told him no before.  ""You dare refuse me, you insignificant worm?""  I backed away from him and realised the streets were now empty. Everyone had gone for their afternoon rest, and I was alone. Damn.  ""You will give yourself to me, and I will not hear a word against it!""  My palm, the one that was cut when Apollo's vow to me was sealed, burned. ""No!"" I backed away from him some more, only to find myself being pushed back into an abandoned alley, one that had a dead end. When a wall hit my back, I winced. There was no escape now. I close my eyes and await the inevitable.Zephyrus was close, his breath on my cheeks, his hand pulling on my arm, and then--  He quickly let go, and the scent of honey and warm summer morning filled my lungs. ""He said no, you primitive slug.""  There was a growl, a loud thud, a struggle of some sort. I opened my eyes to find Zephyrus pinned to a wall and Apollo in front of him, his arm on his throat. Artemis had her back to me, an arrow already nocked to her bow. Her dogs were on either side of her, snarling and snapping. The Titan squirmed, but Apollo had him in a firm grip.  ""Leave us, Titan. Leave us and never come back to this place.""  ""Or what?"" Zephyrus had not been bested by an Olympian and looked humiliated. ""What will you do? Sing to me?""  ""No singing for the likes of you."" Apollo snarled. ""I will simply beat you to a bloody pulp, and my sister will geld you and feed your parts to her dogs. What say you, sister? Will you be up for the challenge?""  ""I look forward to it,"" Artemis said with a vicious smile.  ""There, you see? My sister is looking forward to it. How will you feel pleasure again?"" Apollo's eyes narrowed to slits when Zephyrus struggled again. ""How will you face your fellow Titans again?""  That got to him, the shame of being emasculated by a bastard child of Zeus. Zephyrus tried to speak, to reason and compromise perhaps, but Apollo cut him off.  ""Be gone West Wind. Never bother us again.""  Time seemed to stand still. Titan and Olympian glared at each other like two rival lions circling a kill until, finally, Zephyrus growled again before yielding and vanishing.I tried to breathe, to speak, but the world grew dizzy. I was nearly assaulted by a God and he would have gotten away if the twins had not turned up when they did. It was too much. It was all too much. My knees buckled.  ""Cinthus!""  ""I have him,"" Apollo murmured, and lifted me.  Everything shimmered, and I found myself in my bedroom. I was stripped of my clothes, washed, and then taken to bed. There was humming, and the pain in my hand disappeared. Soft pillows greeted me, and strong arms went around me.  ""Thank you,"" I whispered and buried my face in his chest. The warmth of his skin soothed me, the sweet scent of honey lulling me to sleep.  ""Anything for you,"" He whispered back. ""Rest, my love, you need it.""  We heard neither hide nor hair of Zephyrus after that. I heard no gossip from other Gods, and neither had Hermes. Had Zephyrus backed off for good?  I pushed him and the growing feeling of dread out of my mind and focused on Hyacinthus instead. He had grown quiet and withdrawn, always fearful if I was not around. I tried to be with him as much as I could, to make him feel safe. I asked if he wanted to tell his parents, but he refused. He said it would only endanger everyone if his father took it into his head to challenge Zephyrus, and challenge Zephyrus he would if he knew what happened to his son. I respected his wish and tried to come up with as many distractions as I could for him.  Today I took Hyacinthus to an old orchard away from the city--one that had been abandoned and allowed to grow wild.  ""Don't worry, my love,"" I brushed back his hair as we sat beneath an ageing olive tree. ""You are safe now.""  ""Gods do not take kindly to such rejections,"" Hyacinthus rested his head under my chin and sighed. ""Especially the likes of him.""  There was that feeling of dread again.  ""Ignore him,"" I leaned in for a kiss, my smile growing at the need in his eyes. ""Later.""  He blushed and reached into the pack I had brought with me.  ""Discus?""  ""Why not?"" I helped him up. ""You could do with the practise before the games.""  ""First one to throw the fastest wins?""  I picked one out for myself and grinned.  ""Deal.""  Nothing seemed untoward as the morning progressed. We took turns teasing each other, throwing the discus as far as we could. I taught Hyacinthus a few pointers, helped him improve his throw. I came back to my pack for another discus after having shattered my first one by accident.  Look!"" Hyacinthus called out to me. ""Look at how far mine is going!""  I grinned, ready to indulge him. Something then changed. I felt like we were being watched by jealous eyes, angry eyes. The wind felt foul, unnatural, like something else was in command of it.   If I cannot have him, then no one can!   Zephyrus. I dropped the pack just as the wind changed direction again, and then--     Bone shattered.  The smell of blood filled the air.  A body collapsed.  I got to Hyacinthus before he hit the ground. I tried to heal him, to revive him, but his life-force continued to spill out of him. I heard cackling. The Fates. This was Hyacinthus' final destiny.  There was a wail, loud and unnatural, shattering the peace of the grove. It was mine. There were pleadings and screams, and tears, hot and stinging, like a million tiny blades. They too, were mine.  ""Hyacinthus,"" I whispered, between ragged sobs. ""My heart. Do not leave me.""  Hyacinthus' eyes flickered open, briefly, and they already glazed over.  ""A-Apollo..."" He fought for each breath. ""I-I -.""  He fought hard, but he was already losing. Death had him in its grip.  I barely have time for a final farewell.  ""Do not speak. Just listen."" I kissed his hands repeatedly. ""I am grateful to you. Every moment with you has been a blessing, and I would not have it any other way. I love you. I will always love you and no one else. That was my vow to you.""  He smiled. His hand, weak and trembling, tried to reach up to me, and then, he was gone.  Hyacinthus. My joy. The light of my life.

So she doesn't cry, not at the funeral or her initial death.""";indirect thought;third;Riliane's mother;Riliane;;;;;---;herself;;;;;unspecified;jumping;;;;;When Riliane is young, she learns stories. Myths from worlds long gone past, dug from the ruins of a museum that dug them up from ruins. Stories where the gods can be kind or cruel, stories with dashing heroes and creatures she doesn't dare imagine. Her favorite is that of the Trojan princess Cassandra. A tragedy, and yet she memories it and carves the tale into her heart.     When she is still younger, they call her intuitive. She always seems to know when trouble will happen and avoids it. They call it reflex, hypervigilance caused by near constant assassination attempts. When she tells them she dreams of them, they tell her she is plagued by nightmares, and tell her they will fade as she grows.     When she is older, and still gets visions of things yet to happen, they call her mad behind closed doors, before swearing her to secrecy about such things in public. She is taught to feel ashamed of a talent that has saved her life many a time. She is no witch, and her dreams are not purple, so of what significance are they other than a sign of her sanity escaping. She shares a dream once, of a drought, in the council room, and that is all it takes to be outcast.     The drought happens, of course, but why worry about that when the world could point and laugh at the crazy princess, who sees things in her sleep and is convinced they are real in the daytime. If she was not the heir, they would have locked her up in a tower somewhere or sent her to a convent to be forgotten, because it is much easier to discredit than to listen.    But she is the heir, so they do the next best thing: betroth her as soon as possible and make sure the ministry will always have more power than she does. Any supporter she has after that, the ones that call her a prophetess or a Saint, quickly dissappear. But now she has a word for what she sees: prophecies.     She sees her mother's death long before it happens, yet cannot bring herself to mourn the woman who sealed her fate. So she doesn't cry, not at the funeral or her initial death. And the few tears she sheds are not for the late queen, but for the loss of her future. And the loss of a brother, not allowed to come to the palace to serve the insane princess. Perhaps that is what truly seals her fate.     She sees the future in all its bloody glory, and she knows the ministry will be her end. They are foolish, quick to take insult, and quick to line their pockets. They will spark war, and people will die, and they will come for her head. They could use her foresight, but that would require hoping off their pedestals they made for themselves. And that is unthinkable to them.     So she allows it all, does not even speak if she doesn't have too. But she thinks. Thinks of the tailor's daughter she will be soon, and thinks of that brutal fate. She thinks of the Postman, before realizing it wouldn't change much to live that way now. But most of all, she thinks of Cassandra. And little by little she realizes how very alike they are. She wonders if they are one in the same, and the next night she dreams of Troy burning, and of Ajax. She vomits afterwards, before taking a bath and trying to scrub away the skin he touched as he held her down.      When the revolution happens, she stands on the balcony farthest from them, though they all but surround the castle. Still, there are spots they have not circled around to. And so she looks out. And she wonders if she's willing to live a bit longer only for another Ajax or Agamemmnon to come for her. She is not. And so she jumps off the balcony. And Cassandra dies, not for the first or last time.;;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

He's currently surrounded by a patch of crimson and amethyst geraniums, his face forever locked in a soundless, eternal scream. I think birds might be nesting in it, as little cheeps keep coming from it. I would look, but well, I don't want to kill a baby bird.     Maybe Euryale will look for me. She's much more inclined to do what I ask of her, as long as I haven't annoyed her about anything else, like untidiness, or leaving dead soldiers in odd corners. To be fair to her, when it was one or two, it looked quite stylish - when it gets to double figures, it looks obsessive. Bit like any collection really. So I try to keep them down to a minimum - some are in the gardens, others lined like a warning to the cave's entrance, some... some we grind to dust beneath our feet. But only on really bad, angry days.     It's exhausting to be angry all the time.     It's starting to rain, and I can feel the snakes wriggling in discontent, hissing sharply. Shame. I like to feel the rain on my face. Prefer it to sunlight. It gets heavier, soft as kisses on my brows. The snakes are getting more fidgety, tongues flitting out at my ears, deliberately annoying me. 'Fine,' I mutter, and start slinking back to the cave.     That's when I see him, on the edge of the beach. He's dressed in rough, practical clothes, but they are ripped and salt-streaked, soaked through. I can't see his face - he is lying like a ragdoll on his side, and it is obscured by sodden strands of onyx and silver. His body suggests a life of transience - slim firm thighs and well-muscled calves that suggested a lot of walking, a slightly soft belly that suggested a lack of physical labour and a fondness for food and drink. His arms, long and gangly, ended in hands with slim fingers. The nails were short and neat, though one was recently broken, blood welling underneath the cuticle, like he had been scrabbling at something.      A few metres to the side were some shards of wood. A shipwreck then. I knelt beside him, lowering my head to see if - yes, his chest was rising slightly, and if I listened carefully I could hear his heartbeat, weak but stable. I got to my feet, and without thinking it through, scooped the unconscious man into my arms.     I left him on the kitchen table, and that's where my sisters found me. Stheno sighed. 'This isn't a stray cat or dog we can just take in and look after you know?' she chided.     'I know,' I mumbled, irritated as that's not something I could do anymore.      Euryale looked him over, picking at his clothes. 'No rings, no pendants, no weapons, no mysterious birthmarks signifying that he's a scion of the gods. What do we think, legitimate castaway or something to fuck us over?'     Stheno sighed again. 'Who knows?' She tutted again. 'Why did you bring him in again Medusa?'     I had got distracted by the candlelight reflection off the man's skin, like watching sunlight bounce off a copper kettle. I looked up to find them both smirking at me. 'I- I don't know!' I could feel my snakes coil and hiss. 'Just - just shut up!'     'Pretty sure we didn't say anything,' Euryale mutters, but she turns back to the man. 'Shit, I think he's coming to. Pass me that glass of water, and you two get out, just in case he's up to something.'     The man's brows (thick and black, like caterpillars) moved together, and he sat up suddenly. He started coughing, and Stheno grabbed me and jumped back out of the room, out of his eyesight but we could still see him, hidden by the darkness. He sat up and turned his head. 'Where- where am I?' he asked, his voice parched and rusty.     Euryale stood up straight, all nine-foot of her, wings wrapped behind her. She smiled at him through tusks. 'You are at the house of the Gorgons, so I wouldn't try anything.' We could see her smile start to falter. A look of confusion had settled on the man's (quite handsome) features, but there was no look of abject terror or fear, not like Euryale was used to.     There was silence for a while. 'I am sorry, but I don't know what you would be expecting me to be trying. To be honest, I'm just so grateful I'm safe and not yet in Hades. Drowning is a horrible way to go.' He cleared his throat. 'Thank you, just thank you' he said softly, his voice soft and sweet, musical like the chiming of bells. 'May I have a drink of water please?'     Euryale's mouth fell open, and I had to swallow down a laugh. She looked so confused and foolish. 'Um, yes,' she said, bustling with the cups and carafe on the side. Euryale is always happiest when she is given something practical to do. She held out a cup towards him, but he made no move to take it. 'Here,' she said brusquely.     He moved a hand in her general direction. 'Um, if you could-'     'Oh shit, he's blind!' shouted out Stheno, not only deafening me but also revealing we were there.      His head turned towards the noise, and I could see his face for the first time. He had eyes the colour of earth, but the pupils were off centre. He smiled, but it looked sad. 'Um, yes I am. Since I was a child.' He turned back to Euryale. 'I am Theofylaktos, but Theo please. I was travelling from Athens when the boat I took passage from was hit by a storm.'     'What were you doing in Athens?' asked Euryale, guiding the cup to his hand. I could see he didn't shudder at her touch, though it must have felt cold and reptilian.      'I am a storyteller.'     'And that's a job is it?' said Stheno.     Theo looked sheepish. 'Yes. Admittedly not a particular prestigious or lucrative one, but-'     'And people listen to stories? As if they haven't got anything better to do?' scoffed Stheno.     'Really? We're doing this?' I said angrily, before I could stop myself. His gaze flicked to my direction and I could see his smile grow warmer. I ignored the arched eyebrow that Euryale was giving me, and the snigger I could hear from Stheno. I took a deep breath. 'I should probably get dinner. How are you with fish, Theo?'     'Well, I prefer them on the plate rather than beside me, but yes, fish for dinner sounds nice.'     I could hear Stheno griping behind me about 'having to cook it first', but I ignored her and left. For some reason the cave, usually so comfortable and safe, suddenly felt stifling and cramped. The darkness suddenly felt too warm, like a coat I didn't need but couldn't take off. I needed air.     I felt that itching underneath my skin. I needed to run.     *     I feel that if a man were writing about it, he'd start talking about the scenery. The way the guttering candlelight flickered on the walls, like spirits. Or that the precious jewels in the ceiling shone like stars. Or talk about it in the vaguest terms, like 'he moved in her', or 'as relentless as the sea, a force of nature'.     There was nothing natural about it. My ears were full of his grunting and my own panicked heartbeat. I couldn't see anything except his eyes, which swallowed everything. He was heavy, far too heavy, and I felt like all the air was being smothered out of me. My lungs felt full of concrete, and I was choking on a scream I couldn't get out. I could hear my bones grinding together where he held my wrists, and it hurt. From the waist down it hurt so much, like I had been torn in half.      Afterwards he said nothing. Just adjusted his belt and his robes and left. I lay there, exhausted, body and mind numb. And then a flash of light, Athena in all her glory.     'You have sinned-' she began to proclaim.     'Where were you?' I snarled. I bared my teeth, and could feel my hands twitch. I burned with the desire to rush at her, to claw out her eyes. 'Where the fuck were you?'     Perfect golden eyebrows creased, and alabaster skin wrinkled ever so slightly. 'Excuse me, you can't-'     'Did you only just realise what was going on? Did you just leave me, when you could have shown up at any time?'     Her face grew cruel, her mouth scar across a landscape. 'What you have done is an affront-'     'WHAT I HAVE DONE?!' I screeched. I gnashed my teeth, and I looked at her, my blood boiling. 'I have done nothing.' I laughed, the sound bitter and venomous. 'You think I wanted this?'     'SILENCE' she thundered, the sound hitting like a rain of fire. 'Beastly, beastly thing! Disgusting, corrupt...'     On and on she went, a thousand insults as I felt my body twist and snap, break and reshape. I could see my hair fall out, and heard the hissing around my ears. I saw my nails lengthen, my skin harden and become scales.     'You think this frightens me?' I goaded, the pain making me brash and bold.     'This isn't your punishment,' Athena said icily. 'Loneliness is.'     *     I got back, fish in tow, and a few herbs from the garden. I found my sisters around the table, watching Theo tend to the fire in the hearth. He moved with confidence, and he was chatting away. I wondered if he would feel so comfortable if he could see who he was talking to.     'Fish,' I say, wincing at my lack of articulacy, and I shove the fish on a stick, over the fire. I cover it in oil and a few herbs that I crush between my fingers.     'Smell nice,' he says, and then his eyebrows rise. 'The herbs, they smell nice.'     I can't see my sisters to know they are smirking. I know they can see the blush on my cheeks. 'Bit of thyme.'     Stheno barks out a laugh, which she tries to pass off as a cough. Euryale is far less subtle. 'Well, we need to do a couple of chores, you guys watch the fish, yeah?' I see a whole conversation go on in a few seconds of eye contact and eyebrow wiggling, and then they are gone.     'Older sisters?' Theo asked.     'Yeah, yes. How could you tell?'     He smiled. 'A guess.' He sighed. 'They remind me a little of my sisters.'     I laughed. 'If I were your sisters, I would take such offense at that.'     He turned to face me. I know he couldn't see me, but it certainly felt strange to look a person in the face. 'What do they look like?'     I felt uneasiness, and it felt as if something was stuck in my throat. 'Um, why...'     Theo moved a hand, as if he were going to touch me, then withdrew it. 'I know I was a bit slow earlier... I'm going to blame that on the nearly drowning thing... but I have heard of the Gorgons.' He shuffled his chair closer, dropping his voice. 'Forgive me, I'm a storyteller, but now I'm in a story of my own, and it's-'     'What?' I ask, dreading his answer.     'Well, it's exciting!' he says, almost breathless. He bites and wets his bottom lip, and I see a flash of pearly teeth. 'Sorry, I hope I haven't offended.'     'It's not a nice story,' I say, voice cold as ice. 'This is my life, not a bit of whimsy for your entertainment.'     His eyes widen. 'I'm sorry, of course it isn't, I didn't mean...' He sighs. 'I'm sorry.' He taps his fingers nervously on his leg.      'You say you have heard about us. Do you think you know everything? Do you think you know us?'     He shakes his head. 'Of course I don't, how could I?' He sits up straighter. 'But I'd like to.'     'Not afraid we'll eat you?' I hiss.     He smiles, but it's a twisted thing. 'Maybe a little. But I'm more scared of gods than of monsters.' He stood up suddenly. 'Wasn't always blind, didn't have to rely on other people telling me things about  my  life.' He stormed out of the room, hands trailing the wall.     I heard Euryale tut behind me. 'Smooth Med, smooth.'     Sorry this took so long, real life got in the way. As usual, all comments/kudos/feedback welcome. Hope you enjoy.  'Smooth Med, smooth.' I heard her words, but I refused to think about what she had meant by them. 'Fish will be done soon.'     There was a clatter from further within the cave, an unmanly yelp and the sound of falling stone. 'Didn't expect something to be there, sorry,' came Theo's voice, penitent and sheepish.     'Told you it was getting cluttered,' Euryale remarked. She began to shuffle onto the chair next to me, budging me with her hip. 'Go help him, I'll look after the fish. Give you a chance to apologise too.' I muttered something about not needing to apologise, my snakes hissing in discontent, but Euryale flicked my ear. 'Go on, bugger off.'      I found Theo very cautiously standing near where the statue had toppled, one hand on the wall, slightly bent at the waist, other hand feeling in the air around him. His head turned to me as I approached. 'I'm sorry, I was being an ass,' he said. 'Now I'm breaking your things.'     'Never liked that one anyway,' I said, my voice deceptively light. 'Fish will be ready soon.' I gently take his hand. 'Want me to guide you?'     His hand was soft and warm, and didn't shake at my touch. 'It sometimes takes me a while to get my bearings in a new place.' He moved off the wall, moving closer to me. He smelt of salt and also citrus. 'I won't be a burden to you for long Medusa.'     I almost trip up over my own feet. 'You know what I am?' I ask.     'Your sisters told me their names, and I could work out the rest.' His hand tightened in mine. 'I know  who  you are. I know that you were the one who took me from off the beach. I know that you can't hurt me in the way that you can hurt others.' He smiled softly. 'I know that you caught fish, and are cooking it for me to eat, and it's been a long time since someone has been so kind to me.'     I can feel my face start to heat, and the snakes in my hair start to wriggle closer to it, a soft susurration caused by their movements. Theo's head shifts to one side, listening. 'So it is true...' he says softly.      I jump away from him, as if burned. What, did I think I would be able to hide? Even without being seen, there were many things that made me monstrous. 'This way,' I say, letting my voice be a guide. It's hard to see clearly in the gloom, but he almost looks disappointed, but why he would be I do not know.      *     Theo proves to be useful with his hands, good at weaving and cooking. Stheno, with the tact of a stone wall, asked him why he was so skilled at women's work, and he only smiled and said 'no one wants to train a blind soldier'.      He told stories. Of gods. Of monsters. Of mortals. Some were short and silly - some long, epic tales. All were a delight to listen to.      We were sitting on the beach, backs against a rock, basking in the sun, which had become a habit of late. There was little space between us, and I could feel the heat coming off his side. It took all my control not to lean into it, to wrap myself around him, like the reptile people think I am.      '...and that's when the ship sank. Bloody sirens,' he finished, leaning back and closing his eyes. He smiled. 'Now I am here, so can't complain I guess.'     I take a deep breath. I want to ask, but I know it's a personal question. 'You said you weren't always blind,' I started, keeping my voice soft. 'How did it come to be so?'     A frown crossed his features. 'Are you sure you want to hear it? It's a very boring tale, with an angry god.' He sighed. 'Hundreds of such stories.'     'But it's a story of you, isn't it?' I say, shocked at how breathy I sound. Shocked at how desperately I want to know more of this man. 'How could it be boring?'     He barks a laugh, and smiles, and it's like sunshine. He opens his eyes, looks over to me. 'Med, you flatterer.' He laughs again, then his face turns serious. 'I will tell you, if you answer a question about you.'     I feel my blood turn to ice-water. Surely he can't ask? He can't expect me to tell-     'What colour are your eyes?' he asks suddenly.     'Green,' I say automatically.      He smiles. 'Thank you, that's a start. But what sort of green?'     I huff. 'Green.'      'Yes, but -', and he waves his hands, warming to his theme, '-are they olive-green? Grass in sunlight green? The sea on a calm day green? The green of a forest, the green of emeralds, or the green of Stheno's awful cooking?'     I make a dismissive noise, echoed by my snakes, who I would almost think are laughing at him. 'I wouldn't say any of that.'     'That's because you do not have a poet's soul, like I do,' he says, voice sombre with mock solemnity. 'You are incredibly practical, it's almost weaponised.'     I don't know why, but I reach over to the top of his thigh, resting my claws on top of it. A light enough pressure not to cut but just so he can feel the sharpness of them through the fabric. 'I have many weapons.'     He starts to breathe quickly, and his off-centre pupils start to dilate. He looks over to me, and I can see his throat move as he swallows. My own heart seems to be in my mouth, and I feel both hot and cold all over. He licks his lips, and all I want to do is put mine on them and taste him.      'Med,' his voice is soft, almost reverent. 'I...' He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath.      I move my hand so it's the soft pads of my fingers on him, and I increase the pressure. I move it up slightly higher. I am nervous, but also feel powerful, and it is a confusing mix. 'Is this okay?'     He is biting his lip, and it looks as if he is close to shaking. 'Yes, it is, whatever you want...'     What do I want? I want to see this man undone.      I shuffle to my knees, both hands on him, one hand on his thigh, the other on his chest, over his heartbeat. I lean in, catching his scent, and it makes my mouth water. I mouth at his neck, licking at the skin. I forget the snakes for a moment, heedless as they brush against him. I can hear him whimper, and feel his heart race under my hand.      My skin feels too tight but also as if lightning was running through it. A core of molten heat undulates through me, and I  want, I  need ...     Without thought I am on top of him, my legs either side of his. My lips have moved onto his, and he is moaning into my mouth, and I swallow the sound greedily. His hands are on my back, and I freeze. He may not be able to see the monster, but he could feel...     'You feel like polished shell and pearl,' he breathes, and his hands trail across my skin. 'Precious, beautiful...' he whispers, until his lips are busy with mine again.      It is no work to move his clothes, to press skin against skin, to welcome him into the deepest, darkest parts of me. It is pleasure, it is power and it is bliss.     Later, we lie entangled on the sand, the light of the later sun soft but still warming. Our hands are interlinked, and I lean on his chest.      'Do you still want to know my story?' he asks. I say I do, and he starts to tell me.     *    I lived in a small village by the coast. It was humble, mostly fishermen and their families. I was young, only eight winters, when a man came to our house, asking for alms.         Now, my mother was very beautiful. Hair like spun gold, and eyes of sapphires.       What was she like though?  Kind, very kind.       The man has eyes like the sky at night, and he says he is hungry. And while I can see a wolf, no one else seems to. Not my mother, not my father, nor my sisters. And one day my father is sailing, and my sisters are at the market, he comes again.         'Go out,' my mother says, though it doesn't sound like her. Her eyes are dull, and her voice sounds like it is coming from much further away. And I want to stay, but the man looks at me, his eyes like chasms in the earth,  GO  he says, and somehow my feet move without my mind agreeing.        I am by the crossroads by the time I can feel myself in control again, and I feel a bone-crushing weariness. I need to sit, catch my breath, and this takes a few minutes. I realise I am a few miles from home, I must have walked for a good hour.         Then I see her. She is tall, taller than any man could be. Skin so white it shines, and hair of garnet piled in delicate braids on her head. She is wearing a cloak of peacock feathers, and I know who she is and I am terrified.          Terrified if my mother is discovered.         So I run. It is not a easy path, and I am a small child, weak, and I stumble. But I know I must get to my mother before Hera does, so I run.         And I get to the cottage, and I start to scream, to bang on windows. My mother comes out to meet me, hastily dressed, and she catches me as I fall in exhaustion, 'Hera' on my lips. I hear the sound of thunder, and the air is thick with the smell of a storm.         My eyes close. When I open them again I can see nothing but blackness.         'Zeus's little look-out, were you?' says a female voice, loud as waves crashing on the shore, a hundred birds in flight. 'You'll never look on anything again.'       *     He is silent for a long time after his story, and I hold him tighter. As if my love could heal him, not his sight but his anger. He holds me back, fingers even entwined in my head of snakes, gentle with them.     We are both cursed. But now, at least in this moment, we are both blessed.      (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    Days passed. I am not sure how many. I lost sense of time somewhere between Theo's soft lips and gentle fingers, his sweet sighs and his musical laughter. We argued sometimes, usually about stupid things, but sulks were quick and soon forgotten, usually telling some joke or other that made the other smile.       My sisters did not question his staying, simply moved the patterns of their lives around him. Like he had always been there. He mended things, helped to cook and clean, fished a little, tended to the garden. Helped me identify the birds as we both listened to their song.       One evening he had come back from a walk on the beach and even without improved senses you could sense the anger coming off him. It heated the air around him, a walking flame, and my snakes coiled against my head, almost in fear. Each of his steps were heavy, as if he were stomping. 'What's wrong?'       His face turned towards me, his mouth the line of a knife blade. His features softened instantly, and his shoulders sagged. 'I'm sorry, just had a run-in with a god, and it left me fuming.' I must have gasped, because he shook his head quickly. 'Not him,' he reassured me, knowing me too well. 'Apollo.'       'Why, what did he want?'       His face hardened again. 'To offer something he thought I'd want, but at a price I wouldn't pay.' He scoffed. 'The gods really know nothing sometimes.' He turned to me, putting out a hand, waiting for me to take it. I did without thinking, relishing the warmth of his touch. 'Med, you want me to be here, don't you?'       I moved closer to embrace him, leaned my face into his neck, kissing it softly. 'Course I do. Is that what you want?'       His arms came round to hold me even closer. 'Med, yes. With all my heart, yes.' He gently drew my head up, and kissed me softly on the lips. 'I love you.'        And suddenly I knew what this lightness and tightness in my chest had been, when I had been with him or not. Why he was my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night. The physical want I understood, but why I felt calmed by his voice, why I craved his touch, my skin hot and cold underneath it.       'I love you,' I whispered. 'It's a bit terrifying.'       He held me tighter. 'Yes, it is,' he conceded, his smile in his voice.       *       A few days later I was walking along the water's edge, looking for pretty shells to border the vegetable patch, when I sensed him. The air changes when a god walks amongst you. It's as if normal sounds are stopped, and the ether around you starts to hum. There is a cloying sweetness in the air, like burning flowers, and colours dim.       I turned and saw someone I had not seen before. He was tall, far taller than a human, with the proportions of a statue. Golden curls tumbled around his head, and his skin shone like the light of the dawn sun.       'I am Apollo, God of truth and prophecy, of healing. I am poetry and music made flesh. I am he who is the Sun and the Light.'       'You're trespassing.'       He huffed, and his tone became more snipey and less solemn. 'I am a god, we go where we wish.'       'Well, go somewhere else.'       He visibly bristled. 'Such insolence. Tell me, does living here do that to everyone? Is it something in the air, or in the food you eat?'       'Did you come here for a reason?' I asked, bored.       He turned to face the waves. 'I was here recently. I came to speak to the man who is living with you and your sisters.'       I nodded. 'He spoke of it.'       Something flashed across golden eyes. 'What did he say?'       'That you offered him something he didn't want.'       Apollo snarled, showing perfect white teeth. 'I offered him salvation. An end to his hurt.' He folded his arms. 'I offered him his sight.'       I felt sick. I had to breathe deeply, use all my will not to fall to my knees in shock. He was offered his sight? To be whole again? So many years of pain and suffering, he could have... then I realised what Apollo was really offering.       'He saw through you, didn't he?' I answered, and started to laugh. My snakes started to hiss, adding their own mockery to Apollo. 'A blind man saw right through you.'       Apollo looked confused. 'What do you mean?'       'Athena suggest this to you? Probably not outright, but talked about Theo to you, yes? What better way to keep your legend going than to cure a storyteller?' I advanced towards him, keeping his eyes on mine (I can't kill a god but they still don't like to meet my gaze, I know it causes discomfort). 'But he knew that if he took your offer, he risked the wrath of Hera. And not only that, but he would have to leave me, and he resented being used as a weapon against me.'       'He refused outright. He walked away!' Apollo spat out. He looked away. 'I don't understand,' he said, his words quiet and wounded.       'Of course you don't, none of you would,' I tell him. My words are calm, but sharp-edged. 'You don't understand self-sacrifice because you don't feel real pain or loss. You know jealousy and desire and pettiness, but you don't know love.' I open my jaws, to show sharp teeth. 'And that's why they will outgrow you.'        I am close enough to him now that I could reach out and claw at his perfect skin. It would burn me, but it would be worth it. Except I do not need to, because my words will hurt more.       'And they will not worship you.'       Apollo steps back, and his golden eyes are now red, burning. 'You speak nonsense! You are not immortal, what do you know of anything?'       'Then why are you so upset by my words, if they are untrue?' I start to turn away, dismissing him (it is perhaps unwise to dismiss a god, but what more could they do to me?). 'I have things to do.'       Later that night I do not talk to Theo about what Apollo said to me. That comes later. We fight, and I ask if he regrets his choice, and his anger is forgotten and he holds me. 'Never,' he whispers.        Over the years, he stays. His hair becomes more silver than black, his movements slower and more clumsy. His words do not come to him as quickly as they once did. He has aches and pains, and while Stheno finds him medicines to help, they become less and less effective.       Humans are so frail, especially when they are old. It comes to a time when his skin is like paper, wrinkled and delicate. His eyes are now duller and a weaker shade, more the colour of buffed leather than earth now. But his smile still warms up the room and sends shivers through me.       We are sitting on the clifftop edge, in one of the most picturesque spots. From it you can see the waves and the endless sky. He turns to me. 'I know you know I am dying.'       'You're a storyteller,' I reproach. 'You could lie about it.'       'I've never lied to you Med, and I won't start now.' He takes my hand in his, kisses it. 'I don't regret a single thing of my life with you. I just wish I could see you.' He smiles. 'See what kind of green your eyes are.'       I panic. Because what if he did see? Saw the monster I was? The reptilian skin, the claws, the mass of writing snakes? And in that moment I can hear Athena's laughter in my head, as I watch in horror as his pupils move, centreing themselves.       He blinks, as if the light hurts him. He looks down at my sitting body, and he starts to laugh. 'It does shine like mother of pearl, I was right!' he exclaims, and for a moment his youth and vitality comes back. He does not look into my face yet, but gently moves his fingers towards my snakes, letting them come to him. 'They're such beautiful patterns. Hello, hello,' he whispers to them.       I am trying hard to control my breathing. I want to run, to get away, even let myself fall into the waves below if I have to.       'Med, look at me,' he whispers, coaxes.       'But you'll die,' I spit out, and I try to sound authoritative but I sound like a child, frightened in the dark.        'But I'm dying anyway,' he teases. 'Let me choose the time and the manner.'       'I can't be the one who kills you!' I sob.       'You're not,' he reassures me. 'I am well aware who is responsible for this, and why.' He grabs my chin and raises it, and though I have my eyes closed I can feel his lips on my eyelids, a benediction. 'But they don't get it, do they? That this is the best I could hope for, a painless death after a life well lived. And a death with the person I love with me.' He kisses me again, desperate. 'Please Med,' he pleads.       I open my eyes. I am trapped by the warmth of his gaze. For a few seconds he holds it, then I break away to look down at his feet.       The change is gradual, like a slow-tide, but unstoppable. His flesh turns to grey stone, and it moves up his body. His hands in mine become cold, and he moves away. He keeps his eyes locked onto mine.       'Doesn't hurt,' he says. 'If anything, it's nice not to feel the pain. Bit like a warm bath, or going to sleep.' He smiles. 'And your green eyes are beautiful. I don't have the words to describe them.'       'You absolute bastard,' I say, laughing.       'Well, by the time you meet me in the afterlife, perhaps I'll have come up with something.' He closes his eyes, leans back against the rock. Peaceful. 'I love you. Always have, always will.'       'I love you too.'       I want to say more, but he cannot hear me. There is only stone where there was once flesh, blood and a beating heart. I stay until the night comes. I shed my tears.       Though ultimately my heart is light when I go back into the cave. I do not know how many years I have, but I do not despair. However lonely I am, I have known love, and that will give me succour. And I will see him again.       Besides, I beat the bitch after all, didn't I?

Blue bruises at her throat, skin covered with the milky sheen of death, unnaturally stiff and hard to the touch.""";narrator;third;Antigone;Antigone;;;;;Ismene's uncle;unknown;;;;;being choked;unknown;;;;;"Ismene had to wait until night fell like a burial shroud over Thebes. Once the sound of weeping and shrieking had quietened, leaving the city in the midst of a stricken lull of silence, she crept down to the place where her sister's body lay. There was a guard posted at the entrance, but he ducked his head and moved away from the doorway when he saw her.  There was no will to uphold the king's authority in Thebes tonight. Not after what her uncle had done in the name of power.  Antigone was poised on a stone slab, cold and unmoving. No one could have mistaken her for a sleeping girl: this was a corpse. Blue bruises at her throat, skin covered with the milky sheen of death, unnaturally stiff and hard to the touch.  And Ismene did touch.  She ran her hands up the folds of Antigone's death robes, pushing the cumbersome fabric aside to bare the marbled, blistering skin below. Death was leaching from Antigone's pores, doing its slow insistent work of breaking down the flesh and skin. One day, not too far from this, there would be nothing left at all of her sister.  But tonight--tonight, Antigone's body was intact enough, even if her shade was already reunited with their cursed family down in Hades.  Ismene leaned forward. The guard was long gone, leaving her and her grief alone with her sister. Ismene's grief was towering thing, pressing down on her from above like she was being buried alive by it. There was nothing she wanted more than to be in Antigone's place. To lie alongside her, thigh to thigh, cheek to cheek, cold heart to cold heart.  She had never been brave before, but grief sent fresh courage flowing through her veins. She clambered up onto the stone, coming to rest astride her sister's body and covering it with her own. Up close, she could see the blood beginning to pool beneath the pale skin, turning Antigone's face a mottled blue and black.  Once, she would have looked away. Now, she leaned closer, until her nose brushed Antigone's cheek. She turned her head and pressed a kiss to her sister's lips. It was cold and lifeless, nothing like a real kiss, but she persisted regardless. She wished for Antigone's hot breath against her skin, could almost imagine the whisper of it against her hair, but Antigone remained stubbornly unresponsive beneath her.  Do something! Ismene's heart screamed at her wayward sister. Make this stop! Why do you always leave me behind, where I can't follow?  Her palms struck out at Antigone's stiff chest, raining down blows that meant nothing. Ismene snarled and spat and shrieked at her sister's corpse, and still Antigone lay there, unmoved.  Slowly, the fight leached out of Ismene. Slaps and punches softened to caresses, to soft touches from the hollow of Antigone's throat to the dip of her navel. Ismene's hands moved of their own accord, like a god was possessing them and forcing them to do things that would have made Ismene recoil in disgust.   But truly, she knew that her actions were hers, and hers alone; she could no longer remember disgust. What worth had feelings like that, now that her sister's body lay rotting before her? Antigone was dead, Ismene was mad: they were both repulsive, twinned at last in this one thing.  Her sister had never wanted Ismene to be part of her when she was alive, but now she had no choice. They were in this moment, if never before and never again, inextricably bound.  Ismene's hair fell over Antigone's face like a shield, hiding them both inside their own private world.  ""Sister,"" she whispered, her voice cracking with the weight of all the things contained in that simple word.  She shifted, slipping a hand between her body and her sister. She could feel her own tears rolling down her cheeks, falling in hot droplets onto her sister's cold flesh. Her fingers curled into the coarse hair between her sister's legs, pushing her icy thighs apart. What was once all heat and wet and open warmth was now dry and resistant.  Ismene pressed her mouth against Antigone's lips as if she could share her breath. She pushed two fingers into Antigone's cunt. It was difficult; Antigone's body had never been built to yield, and it gave even less to Ismene in death. Ismene hoped the warmth of her fingers, the throb of her pulse that she could almost feel in their tips, might melt something inside Antigone, might be the lure that led her back to the world of the living.  It was a vain hope, of course. She curled her fingers inside Antigone with all the desperation of a young husband trying to coax his new bride from her frigid fear of his touch, as if she could give Antigone anything: pleasure, pain, it was all beyond her now.  Ismene rocked her hips, rubbing her cunt against Antigone's stiff, unyielding body. It was too dry, too cold, too awful--but there was a sort of triumph in it, too, a meeting of two bodies that sent sparks of hideous, shuddering heat through her.  She drew her fingers from Antigone and pushed them inside herself. She gasped and clenched around the intrusion, let her cries leak into Antigone's slack jaw as she screwed her eyes shut and forced herself to the edge of her release. She came with a painful jolt, eyelashes fluttering against her sister's cool cheek.  Suddenly, with her cunt still pulsing around her fingers, the only thing Ismene could feel was blinding fury. The kind of fury that longed to tear out throats, to raze a city to ashes, to hunt down a god and kill him with her bare hands.  ""I hate you,"" Ismene whispered through cracked lips as she let her full weight fall on Antigone's corpse. ""I hate you for leaving me.""  She said it again and again, the words slurring and choked through tears of rage. They felt good to say because of how horrific they were. Each professed hatred was like a knife sliding under her flesh, unmooring her from her body.   I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.   But she knew that if she forced herself to confront the truth, it was this: it was not her sister she hated. It was herself, for still being afraid of Antigone even in death. Otherwise, would she not have already chosen to follow her sister to Hades?  Ismene lay atop Antigone, chest to chest--closer than she had ever been to any other human being, yet further apart from her sister than ever before.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;0;1;0;rule;0;0;1;0;rule

It was impossible not to when he smiled like that.  How sad was it? That she had come to associate her husband's smile and happiness with his cheating?  Because she knew, she followed him, in the death of the night, to a mortal's house. She refused to call it by its name, the stalking, as she watched them talk.  Soon it became apparent, he had been seen this human the whole month, they wouldn't be that close otherwise; and she --the mortal, Semele-- knew he was him, knew he was Zeus.  When he cheated on her with a mortal, they either did not know who he was or they knew, but they only stayed together for a few days, a week at most.  This change in routine meant trouble for Hera; this could mean that he was ready to replace her, find someone better --someone like Amphitrite, someone who doesn't take revenge on his lovers, who cares more about the advantage such union gave her than the meaning of it--.  The normal punishment --on the lover, on their children-- would not suffice, she needed to send a message, make him realize --no matter how many he found-- only one would remain. He could only have her. This one had to be harsh, off-putting; he had to be the one to do it, to suffer the consequences.  So she stayed and waited until he went back up to Olympus, then she started talking.  ""How do I know he is Zeus?"", she said in the mortal's head. ""What proof did he give me to know he is a god, a king, the king of gods?"". The way it was phrased, the mortal could only think they were her own thoughts. ""There is a way to know"", she told her, ""If he swears on the river Styx to never hide anything from me, then I ask him to show me the real him, he will have no option but to do so"".  She tapped into magic, amplified those thoughts, erase all will to question them and what they entail.  She looked at her work, smiled and left. Zeus has in for a little surprise.  ""You promised!"", his lover screamed.  ""I know, I know, but please understand why I mustn't"", he begged. He could not help but hiss as his skin started to burn from breaking his new oath. He shouldn't have sworn, he knew better than to do so.  ""Do it!"". He shouldn't. He knew this was not her, she was not like that. Alas, there wasn't another option.  ""Forgive me, Semele"", he whispered and closed his eyes. He let her see him, with all his divinity, for only a second. Unfortunately, humans were far more fragile than he had ever cared to notice. He refused to look at her corpse, intensely burned in some places, completely raw in others.  He amplified his senses to detect all life forms in the area, hoping his aura did not reach outside the house. Then, he felt a faint life in front of him, it could not be her, it had to be...  He knelt at her side and put a hand on her; it wasn't her, it was something inside.  He took a shaky breath and did what he had to without acknowledging it.  Soon, but far too late for his mind, he had the demigod in his arms. It had not grown enough, and there was only one thing, one magic spell, he knew could help in this situation.  He sat down as the weight settled inside him. Took a minute, and left the house. Sooner or later a neighbor would find Semele and prepare her funeral, there was no point in staying there anymore.  He only left a note, ""Cause of death: divine aura, accident"".  He should go back to Olympus, but could not bring himself to do so, not at the moment. He needed rest and to process... All that.  So he flied to Crete, to his mountain, to his cave. It was smaller than he remembers, but he was small back then.  He gave a satisfied sigh at the sight of his old belongings, they weren't many, but they were his.  The once too large blanked now fitted perfectly as he settled down for a nap.  She did not see her husband until three days after Semele's death. She had gone down to her house after Zeus had been gone for one too many hours. She watched as the neighbors prepared the funeral, as they discussed a strange note that had been left there --obviously from the god-- and the odd burns on the house interior walls.  When he came back, she knew something was wrong, too wrong. He tried to hide it, and did it fairly well, but there were things everyone could notice. How defensive he was. How tired he was.  They had another fight, that was... Not good, but common, routine, safe. Except it wasn't, normally neither would cry, rarely she would cry --out of anger--, now he did --but he did not look mad, but sad--. And he fled the room, fled Olympus.  He did not come back until a week later. And all he said was ""You did it, didn't you?"" with the more apathetic face he had ever made. That's all he said for the rest of the month, refusing to talk outside of meetings if she was in the room.  Apollo tried to check on him multiple times, but he refused to. Ares began following him around the palace, claiming to be ""his bodyguard""; he did not seem to mind it too much. Poseidon and Hades tried to talk to him, to get to know what was going on, but could only get him to admit he needed a hug or help with something --sad enough, that was more open than usually--.  Then he disappeared again; Hermes claimed to have found him, but that Zeus refused to go back and preferred if no one knew his location. He went back and forth, from Olympus to the secret location, during the day --when Apollo was too busy to follow personally-- in the shadows --where the sun could not follow him-- and constantly changing the route --making it too complicated for Iris to deduce where he was headed--, and gave them Zeus' orders to maintain Olympus afloat while he was gone.  Months later, he came back.  Acted like nothing had happened, which only worried Poseidon and Hades more, though they did not express it verbally.  Refused to talk about it, if she brought it up; if Hera name-dropped Semele he looked at her dead in the eye and refused to elaborate.  ... At least she had gotten what she wanted, he was no longer open with any lovers --which did not mean he had any less, in turn, he had more and more and barely stayed a day with any of them--. Yes, he did not talk with her either... But it did not matter, right? They were never close like that, why would it matter?  Movement at her side woke her up. Her husband was rolling in his sleep, clearly disturbed. Concern filled her mind as she tried to calm him down, then to wake him up when that did not work.  He talked in his sleep ""Please, please, Semele, you know I... I cannot do that, please, I beg you"". She froze at that. She knew it had affected him, that was the whole plan, to affect him so much he would not dare find a replacement.  He started to cry, tears falling as he tried to stop the memory. He suddenly awoke with a scream. She hug him as he continued to cry, taking his hair in his hands and not looking at her, but pass her, like he wasn't in his room.  She rocked him back and forth and whispered reassurances in his ear.  When he managed to calm down enough to notice where he was, he just pushed her away. ""Do not touch me"", he said.  ""Is everything okay?"". They turned around to see Ares in the doorway, his words meant he had just arrived but how he was standing --hand loosely holding his spear instead of firmly griping it-- made her think he arrived there at the initial scream.  ""Ares"", the king said, ""do me a favor and help me get to Poseidon's, I have to talk with him"".  Their son went back to ""bodyguard mode"" saying ""As you wish, father"" while giving him a military greeting.  She stayed there, asking herself when did they fall apart.  The next years went by as the ones before them, with him cheating and she getting revenge --always making sure he wasn't there to see it--.  He either stopped having nightmares or stopped sleeping altogether as, no matter how late she went to sleep or how early she arose, she could never catch him at nighttime.  Their talks went back to normal and everything was as if the incident did not happen.  Then, the rumors of another child of Zeus appeared; an ascended demigod.  She ignored it at first, she had learned the bad way not all the mortals that proclaimed themselves to be children of Zeus necessary were. Some just thought the pros of being one outweighed the cons, some were demigods of other deities but thought only the king had demigod children for some reason, some were just playing.  But she did ask, ""This 'Dionysus' claims to be your son, is so true?"". The only thing he responded with was, ""He is the son of Semele, only that I will tell you. Don't you dare touch him.""  He left her again, this time as she tried to figure out how that was possible.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

Klytemnestra put a candle on the table, it gave off a tranquil glow, helping Klytemnestra see her reflection in the mirror. The queen's dressing room was not as crowded as usual. Normally, handmaids would fill the room with their sweet laughter and soft footsteps. Klytemnestra always enjoyed these morning chats with her servants. She was not a rigid person--during these chats, she rarely spoke but often listened. Whether it was the rustling sounds within the palace or the distant sayings outside, she had a firm grasp on every whisper through this way.  This does not mean that Klytemnestra was easy-going--she was, after all, from a noble family. Such a person she was, the queen of Mycenae, the daughter of Tyndareus.  The palace had always been a quiet place. The servants were all well-organized. They came and went quietly when their masters needed them, with heads bowed and submissive attitudes, and never dared to disturb their masters. Anyone who witnessed the manner of the palace would undoubtedly praise the mistress for how well she handled everything. ""She has talents,"" they might have said, ""she will be a great ruler one day...If she wasn't a woman.""  A knocking sound drew Klytemnestra's attention. She lifted her head to watch the handmaids come in with their hands full of shining diamonds. ""Hope you have had a great sleep, mistress."" The girls smiled at her and greeted her respectfully. They all stood still, waiting for Klytemnestra's orders. ""Thank you,"" Klytemnestra allowed them to come closer to help her put on all the garments and the sparkling crown. ""How are my children? Did Iphigenia wake up yet?"" Klytemnestra asked, something soft in her voice--she was a mother, and mothers cannot hide their love for their darling children. Some handmaids smiled gently, appreciating the queen's warm tone. One of the closest handmaids answered the question, ""They are doing well. The prince is still sleeping. Iphigenia has already woken up. She is getting dressed now."" Klytemnestra nodded and let out a soft sigh.  ""Are you worried about today's journey, my queen?"" As the dressing process neared completion, the handmaids held all unused pieces of jewelry and went back to their positions. Klytemnestra stood up, adjusting her gown one last time. ""They informed me that her future husband--Achilles, is a great warrior and a man with honour."" Klytemnestra was ready to wave her hand, sending away the servants. ""I hope for the best. Tell Iphigenia to hurry up.""  The servants signalled that they understood and they quickly dismissed themselves, leaving Klytemnestra once again alone in the room. Which is what she wanted. She needed some time to herself. As a mother, she was always proud of her children, especially Iphigenia, her eldest daughter. All the wonderful memories felt as if they had just happened, and yet her little girl was about to get married. Klytemnestra spun her golden ring with her fingertips unconsciously. She got emotional when she started to think about the future of Iphigenia.  Days ago, Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, her husband, asked someone to send her a letter.  ""Agamemnon sends a greeting to my Klytemnestra."" The letter started with, ""I have some news you may want to hear."" And that settled it--an arranged marriage for Iphigenia and Achilles. Klytemnestra did not mean to complain or dare to question the decision of the king but she did feel kind of lost. She thought at least she would have had a chance to discuss marriage with her children; she could have made a list of all those young, beautiful men around the country and picked the perfect one after some careful investigation. But Achilles, according to the old man who brought the letter, seemed to be a good man and indeed a good match for Iphigenia.  At least in this part, she felt truly happy for all this. Very well. She said to herself, ""I shall accompany Iphigenia, and I will walk her to her husband with joyful tears.""  Once again, Klytemnestra heard some footsteps and the gentle sound of fabric rustling. She could not control the smile on her face, even though she had not yet seen who had arrived. ""Mother[2]!"" A voice as clear as crystal rang out, full of joy.  Klytemnestra turned around to welcome her daughter. ""You look great, Iphigenia."" Klytemnestra praised. ""Thank you, Mother,"" Iphigenia said happily. She looked a bit nervous, with her fingers pinching the clothes, but she was absolutely stunning in that deep purple chiton, and her long, curly hair went all the way down her back; some gold-made hair ornaments shimmered in the candlelight, adding a glow to her pale skin. Klytemnestra leaned in to adjust the position of a necklace for her daughter and then, with some reluctance in her voice, she said slowly, ""We have to go.""  The carriage was prepared last night and is now waiting outside the palace. Klytemnestra took the lead and walked toward the gate, followed by her daughter and some handmaids who had been chosen by the pair to accompany them all the way to Aulis.  The carriage was dimly lit. Mother and daughter found themselves bored with few things to do. ""Have some rest, my daughter, if you are tired."" Klytemnestra noticed how Iphigenia had yawned several times. Normally she would not allow this to happen--how can a well-educated, noble lady be so relaxed? But she was willing to make some exceptions for now, as she could not imagine when she would be able to see her dear daughter like this again. ""I know the time is early; the black-robed goddess just drove her chariot across the sky."" Klytemnestra softly patted her daughter and encouraged her to lean against her shoulder. The carriage continuously rumbled along the road, not quite steady but somewhat hypnotic, especially in the darkness of the night. Iphigeneia shook her head. ""Thank you, Mother. But there is no need. In fact, ... do not blame me, Mother. May I ask for some information about my...future husband?"" A faint blush appeared on her cheeks, hard to notice in the darkness.  Klytemnestra smiled and said, ""Of course. I will tell you what I know, for this is a good match, I believe, and this will not be too inappropriate for you to know."" Then, Klytemnestra began to describe this mysterious Achilles, whom she did not even have a chance to meet for herself. ""Your father spoke of him often. He is one of the best warriors on our side, for he has great strength in both his mind and body. The fertile Phthia is his home, the well-known king Peleus is his father, and the water goddess Thetis is his mother. Such a nobleman he is that I am truly satisfied with this marriage, even though it was arranged by your father instead of me."" After hearing her mother say that, Iphigenia felt relieved. Her heart beat fast, and she cannot help but begin to anticipate her marriage.  ""I am just so delighted, my daughter, that you do not have to worry about any harm that will come to you."" After all the silence, Klytemnestra suddenly spoke again, with a low and soft voice, almost like a whisper. ""I am sure Achilles will protect you. May Artemis protect you for now and Hera will guide you in your marriage and household, my dearest daughter.""  For a moment, she seemed profoundly sorrowful, and Iphigenia keenly perceived that.  ""What happened, Mother?"" she asked cautiously.  ""...It was something before your father took me as his wife. But that is something a young lady like you should not ask about."" Klytemnestra gazed up at the sky, trying to determine what time it was and how long it would be until dawn. ""Yes, Mother. Please have some rest as well."" Iphigenia sensibly stopped asking and leaned to the side, falling into sweet dreams.  Under the pale moonlight, Klytemnestra watched her daughter rest, her chest filled with pride. ""I have raised her well,"" she prayed silently with all her heart--may the gods bless her and keep her safe from harm.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  After travelling for a long time, they finally arrived at their destination. The sun had risen. Klytemnestra could see the sea now, vast and deep, stretching endlessly. The surface of the sea shimmered with reflected light, adding some golden glitter to the deep blue. The weather was great, and the sea was calm.  Klytemnestra smiled. This was a good omen. The gods all rejoiced at this marriage.  Aulis was the place where the Greek fleet gathered. This place was supposed to be the departure point for the Greek army but for some reason, they stayed here longer. At least longer than Klytemnestra had expected. With that being said, Klytemnestra did not concern herself with the matter.  It wasn't her place. She had only one task here, and for this task, she was willing to take the risk of being here in the army with soldiers.  This was certainly not an ideal venue for marriage. Thus, Klytemnestra was more worried about Iphigenia, her young innocent daughter.  Agamemnon had already sent servants to welcome their carriage. These servants surrounding the carriage helped the royal family get out of the wagon. Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, was waiting here too. He looked strangely in pain, with his brow furrowed and the corners of his mouth turned down. How surprising! Klytemnestra thought to herself. The king did not look full of happiness like a normal father, especially since he was the one who planned the wedding. Some pleasant laughter rang out behind Klytemnestra. Iphigenia, unaware of her mother's thoughts, rushed into her father's arms. ""Oh, Father[3]! How I missed you!"" Agamemnon opened his arms and caught his daughter tightly. He found himself smiling too. ""My dear daughter, I missed you too,"" he said.  ""That's wonderful! I'm so happy to be with you and keep you company.""  The king lowered his eyes, avoiding the gaze of his family. ""Perhaps,"" he murmured.  Klytemnestra had been amused by their daughter's adorable little gesture, but then she couldn't help but fall into contemplation. Agamemnon let go of Iphigenia and started walking toward Klytemnestra. ""I hope the trip was not too boring and exhausting,"" he said in a hushed voice, with a faint smile. ""Lord Agamemnon,"" Klytemnestra bowed to him. ""We have come here and followed your commands, with hope and excitement."" Then she turned to her handmaids, who waited nearby, and asked, ""How is Orestes? Bring him to his father."" Soon the maids brought the young prince. Orestes was too small to notice anything; he was wrapped in warm and soft fabric. When seeing the face of his father, whom he had not met for quite a long time, Orestes waved his fists; a big smile on his face. Just as if he was aware of the upcoming wedding.  Despite this, Agamemnon still looked weary and sorrowful. ""How are you, Father?"" Now even Iphigenia had noticed that something was wrong. She grasped her father's arm and asked worriedly, ""Is everything alright? I hope you are doing well with all the soldiers, for I know the condition here can't compare with what our home has."" There was a look of concern in her eyes--such a sweet little girl.  There was a moment of silence. They were both waiting for Agamemnon's response. Agamemnon took hold of his daughter's hand; he gazed at his family members, and his tone carried the perfect blend of tenderness and sorrow. ""Forgive me, my daughter,"" he turned to Klytemnestra and added, ""I am sure your mother understands me--how can a father not be sorrowful when his dearest daughter is about to get married into another family? I have not seen you, my precious, in a while because of the war. When will I see you again? This I do not know.""  ""Then,"" there was a bright smile blooming on Iphigenia's face, like a flower in bloom. ""Please forget all the troubles, Papa. I will accompany you as long as I can."" The smile on their daughter's lips was so beautiful, and Klytemnestra realized that she was also beginning to grin. ""Very well!"" Agamemnon looks relaxed as he is comforted by his daughter's warm words, ""But do have some rest now, my daughter, for you have travelled far.""  Some servants stood silently by, upon hearing the king's words they stepped forward and took the initiative to lead the princess to the house.  ""Goodbye for now, Mother and Father."" The young princess bowed to her parents and then followed the servants. Orestes was with his sister right now and she carried him into the house. Even the horse-drawn carriage was taken care of and all the dowry Klytemnestra prepared was taken by some servants into the house.  Then there is only Klytemnestra there with Agamemnon. A silence fell between the two of them. Klytemnestra stared at her husband, wondering if he had any other orders. Agamemnon went silent for a while, and then he walked a few steps toward a more distant, secluded area and gave her a sign, asking her to follow.  Agamemnon was not always a talkative person, or he was, but not always with her. Honestly, Klytemnestra did not care. Their marriage could hardly be counted as a happy one, for she had no right to choose. What was even worse was how Agamemnon brutally murdered her real husband and son--he messed up everything precious to her and then, as a reward for winning the fight, she became a prize for him. But Klytemnestra was a Greek woman with a sharp mind, she knew how to stay in line. She managed the house carefully; she knew what to say to comfort Agamemnon. She gave birth to her children for him and the happiest moments she had were watching her children grow up. This was the light of her mundane life, and she prayed that their lives would be whatever they wanted.  ""I am sorry, Klytemnestra,"" the king's voice woke her. ""...Please follow my words. ...I will be in charge of the wedding ceremony. You should have some rest instead.""  ""...What?"" Klytemnestra widened her eyes, unable to believe what she had just heard. ""I will follow your command at all times, but I do not understand. How can a mother be absent from the wedding of her daughter?""  ""You'll see."" Agamemnon stood with his back to her; his clothes looked meticulously neat and his voice sounded cold. ""It is not suitable for my wife to be around all my men."" ""But then Iphigenia will be here alone, with the same men!"" Klytemnestra almost laughed at the absurd request. ""No, my king, I will not abandon Iphigenia here. I will hold the wedding torch and I will accompany my girl. Unless our customs and piety toward the gods are no longer important to you."" Agamemnon remained silent; Klytemnestra could see his clenched fist.  The silence continued for a while, then the king finally spoke, ""Fine, woman. Do what you want!"" His voice trembled slightly, which gave Klytemnestra a flash of confusion. However, she did not have time to think about it carefully. She turned back into the house to be with her daughter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The house was warm. Iphigenia and Orestes had already laid down, preparing to rest. Seeing that Klytemnestra had finally returned to the house, her daughter grabbed her hand and pleaded with her to stay. ""Please have some rest too, Mother. You are tired, I can see."" ""Do not worry about me, my daughter."" Klytemnestra gently ran her fingers through her daughter's hair, tidying it up for her. ""Mother will stay here with you. Now close your eyes, because there will be many things to do when you wake up.""  After ensuring Iphigenia had fallen into a deep sleep, Klytemnestra walked back outside, gazing at the endless blue sea and enjoying some breeze from Euripos through her delicate hair. The breeze blew away some of her unease. Ready to ignore the strange way Agamemnon behaved earlier, Klytemnestra resolved to prepare for her daughter's wedding with full enthusiasm. Agamemnon was probably too nervous about all this. Klytemnestra murmured to herself, ""Me too. This is the process everyone has to go through, but that doesn't make it easier to accept"". She sighed.  There were some footsteps near her. Klytemnestra turned to check, only to find that the other person seemed to not have noticed her. He was a good-looking man, with armour and weapons--he was a warrior, undoubtedly. More importantly, he looked like one of the best. The man seemed to be startled by her presence. ""Sorry, I did not see you,"" he said, taking a few steps back, respectfully not looking at Klytemnestra. Before Klytemnestra found a chance to speak, an old, hoarse voice suddenly spoke up. ""Our noble mistress, the Queen of Mycenae,"" an old man hurriedly approached them, ""please wait."" And then he recognized the man near Klytemnestra. ""By the gods! I did not know you were there too, Achilles.""  Besides the call of the old slave, Klytemnestra was surprised--she took a closer look at this man and tried to join her hand with Achilles. ""Child of the goddess, daughter of Nereus, you are a noble man--let us join our hands and rejoice! For we will soon be a family, after the wedding."" However, the son of the goddess looked confused; he seemed to know nothing at all, which made Klytemnestra uneasy. ""It would be completely wrong for me to touch what I shouldn't touch."" Achilles simply turned around and decided to leave directly.  ""Wait, the descendant of Aiakos."" The old slave stood in front of them, breathing heavily. ""I have some unfortunate news for my mistress, the daughter of Leda and Tyndareus--for I am your slave, my mistress; your father gave me to you when you married Agamemnon, and I stayed and will stay loyal to you."" He stopped Achilles with respectful yet determined gestures. ""This involves you too, the child of the goddess."" Upon hearing these words, Klytemnestra felt her heart tighten as if a hand had squeezed it. She turned away slightly, not daring to hear what the old slave had to say. ""I know you. Your loyalty is unquestionable. ...Please speak.""  ""There will not be a wedding, my mistress. Our king wants the princess to be there because..."" Klytemnestra anxiously twisted the ring on her finger, and she quickly urged, ""Please, go on.""  ""...Because he plans to kill your daughter and sacrifice her to Artemis.""  For a second, her mind went completely blank. She struggled to stay on her feet. Klytemnestra stared at the old slave intently, trying to detect any trace of dishonesty in his words. Nothing. The old slave was telling the truth, and deep down in her heart, she knew that.  No. No, no, no, no.  How could it be?  This could not happen. There was a sound echoing in her ears; it was her heartbeat, beating faster than ever. Her fingertips were as cold as ice. Klytemnestra closed her eyes, trying her best to figure everything out. Although she was not so intimate with her husband, she knew Agamemnon was not a madman. She tried to calm herself, but the overwhelming sense of panic and loss nearly constrained her throat.  Achilles stands silently behind her, seeming skeptical of all this. ""How could he possibly do that? Kill his daughter?"" ""What are you talking about?"" Klytemnestra says it with a cold tone. Her voice was full of anger. ""Don't you dare say that to me! I demand that you leave."" There were tears in the eyes of the old slave; his voice sounded slow, with a depressed tone. ""I was always loyal to you. Even more so than to the king. I have watched the young princess grow. It is with great sorrow that I talk about this.""  Klytemnestra closed her eyes, preventing any tears from falling. ""Tell us everything.""  Thus, the old slave spoke, ""The Greek army is gathered and ready to go for the war against Troy. Yet, our lord accidentally offended the goddess, the mistress of the woods and animals, the proud daughter of Leto, Artemis, with her golden bow. The goddess demanded our lord make a sacrifice; at least our seer Kalkhas said so. As for the wedding between the girl and the child of the goddess, it was meant to be a disguise. So that you, daughter of Tyndareus, would happily bring the poor girl with you, all the way from Mycenae to Aulis.""  Klytemnestra could no longer hold back her emotions. Everything had been prepared; there seemed to be no way out. Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. No human can suffer such pain--the mother is forced to be separated from her child permanently. Klytemnestra covered her face in a desperate attempt to wipe away all her sorrows, but it was pointless.  ""I apologize."" She tried her best to look better but failed. ""Alas! How can I hold back my tears, my poor daughter and I! Fate has been cruel to us! It was my husband's fault and his brother's problem, yet our daughter is the one to pay for the price!"" Clouded by her own tears, Klytemnestra heard Achilles's sigh. Like a tree hit by a bolt of lightning, she suddenly realized something: ""Achilles, you are the child of a goddess. You are indeed from a good family--a family nobler than mine. I pray that you may help us, for it is your name that my husband used to deceive us.""  No man could stand the suffering in her voice. This was the sound of a broken heart. Yet the child of the goddess, swift-footed Achilles, didn't answer right away. For a moment, he seemed to be lost in thought, and then, with seriousness, he replied, ""Do not worry, daughter of Tyndareus. I am willing to help in every way that I can. Although I don't know if I could truly make a change--Agamemnon is the leader, after all. I was looking for him; once I see him, I will talk about this with him.""  His words gave a glimmer of hope to Klytemnestra, yet her heart still ached terribly. The child of the goddess quickly left. As the leader of the army of Myrmidons, he had many responsibilities to his people.  Klytemnestra stood by the seashore for a long time, with only the old slave for company. The once-bright scenery of the beautiful Euripus seemed to have lost its colour. She took a deep breath, hoping to calm herself down so that her unfortunate daughter would not worry about her when she went back to the house. Unexpectedly, Klytemnestra encountered her husband on her way back to the house. Filled with anger and a sense of betrayal, she quickly caught up with him. Agamemnon was perplexed by her unusual behaviour.  He stopped and faced his wife. ""Is everything all right?"" Klytemnestra wanted to speak, but as soon as she opened her mouth, tears began to fall. ""I am here to ask you, my king."" Agamemnon looked confused, but his lips pressed together, and his gaze shifted to the side.  ""Ask whatever you want; I will always answer."" The king replied.  Now I get it. Klytemnestra thinks to herself. How could I not have realized this earlier? It was obvious.  ""Do you, or do you not, intend to kill our daughter? Kill the child we raised and loved for all these years.""  Her voice sounded calm. Despite all the tears, Klytemnestra continued to stare directly at the king. Agamemnon looked shocked. His eyes widened, but all of a sudden, he looked pale and depressed, as if all his energy had drained away. ""So, you have heard about that."" His reaction said everything.  ""How can you let this happen? It is our daughter whom you want to sacrifice. How can I, as the mother, witness all this?!"" ""Calm down, woman!"" Agamemnon became somewhat enraged, his voice turning hoarse. He could not bear to be accused by his wife. ""I tried to warn you! I sent the old slave to give you a letter, but he failed. Now soldiers have all heard about the sacrifice--they are angry and demanding that I do it sooner! How am I able to go against them all?""  ""How can you not? This is your daughter and now you are about to kill your own daughter with the knife in your hands! What kind of man would have a heart like this?"" After a moment of silence, Klytemnestra continued quietly, ""You had taken my child before and now you are about to do it again.""  ""You do not understand,"" said Agamemnon. ""I am with the Greek army. This is the only way to resolve the matter."" The cold words of Agamemnon disappointed her, yet she was more clear-headed than ever. She watched in silence as her husband hurriedly walked past her without further words.  I knew you would be like that. Klytemnestra felt frustrated. When she finally returned home, her daughter was already awake, smiling at her as usual.  ""I hope you had a good rest too, Mother!"" She greeted her mother with warm words. Klytemnestra tried to pretend everything was fine but she found it impossible. The moment she saw her beautiful and caring child and heard that gentle, happy voice, her tears flowed down her face like a breaking dam. The sorrow was too deep. She held her daughter tightly in her arms, which amused Iphigenia. ""What happened, Mama? You scared me."" Although she knew nothing, Iphigenia opened her arms and hugged her mother. ""Do not worry, I will be there with you.""  Yet, to her surprise, Klytemnestra held her even tighter, just like holding a treasure. The queen was reluctant to let go of the embrace. Who would have thought--she hugged all her children so many times in the past years, but at this very moment, she felt like it would never be enough. Iphigenia wiped away tears for Klytemnestra: ""Pray tell me, Mama. What happened? Did something happen to Father?"" Klytemnestra smiled weakly at Iphigenia, trying to offer some sort of comfort.  She did not know how to tell her daughter about this terrible, tragic fate. Her young girl had just come into her own, like a blossoming flower. There would have been a bright future. Klytemnestra had hoped for a happy marriage for her daughter, unlike the one she had--now this thought seemed like a joke. ""I do not know how to tell you, my child."" Klytemnestra pressed a kiss on Iphigenia's forehead and said, ""Woe is me! What can I do to protect you? Your father is going to do something terrible! The Greek army wants to make a sacrifice to the divine daughter of Leto.""  Speaking those words drained all her strength. Klytemnestra could not look at her daughter, for it would break her heart, though it had already been torn apart. Instead, she hugged Iphigenia desperately. Iphigenia did not speak a word for a few seconds. Klytemnestra noticed that the young girl was confused at first, but then suddenly understood everything.  ""My daughter!"" She cried. Iphigenia was silently shedding tears; her rosy cheeks were now pale as death. ""Mother, I cannot bear to leave you! I cannot bear to leave this world and enter the dark realm of Hades. I love the bright sea, the brilliant sunlight, and the lush trees. I beg you, Mother, do not leave me alone!"" The mother and daughter embraced each other and wept bitterly.  ""Mistress,"" a servant came in, interrupting them, ""there is a message from the child of the goddess, daughter of Nereus."" It was Achilles. Klytemnestra stood up in a panic. She eagerly asked the servant what the news was. ""He said--all the Greeks are against me. There is just no way."" Having heard such awful news, Klytemnestra felt distraught. She had expected this. Achilles was indeed a good man. He did not need to get involved in the first place.  Klytemnestra sat back down, overcome with distress. But then the worst happened. There were many noisy voices outside the house. They sounded Greek. Soldiers had gathered in front of the house, demanding to see the princess. Iphigenia softly took her mother's hand, seeking comfort from her mother. Her palm was moist with tears and Klytemnestra could not help but tightly squeeze her daughter's hand. Someone entered the room; it was Agamemnon. He silently gazed at his daughter and wife.  ""Father..."" Iphigenia cried, ""Please do not do this to me!"" However, Agamemnon looked away. He dared not look at his daughter. ""I am sorry, I am so sorry, my dearest daughter...but the Greeks forced me to do this.  They would kill all of us, all the family members, if I did not do this."" Klytemnestra spoke up, ""But you are the commander! You are sacrificing our beloved daughter for someone else's unfaithful wife and for the sake of your brother's affair. How would you think that this is a fair trade? Gods shall not permit such acts to happen unless they have made another arrangement."" Such a woman she was, even the king could not meet her eyes directly. The queen continued, ""I would take my daughter's place if it is possible. A mother should do anything for her children and I only wish for her well-being-""  Agamemnon sighed, ""Daughter of Leda, please do not say that. Have you forgotten your duty? You should head back to Mycenae, for there are other children for you to take care of."" The king of Mycenae said this to remind Klytemnestra of her position.  Noises outside the house grew louder, and Agamemnon wept as he spoke to his poor Iphigenia, ""My dearest daughter, the Greek soldiers are waiting, growing increasingly impatient. As for me, I would never want you to sacrifice yourself. I, just like your mother, love you as well."" Agamemnon approached Iphigenia, wanting to take his daughter's hand and hug her. The young girl looked surprisingly calm now. She asked her dearest father if this was truly the end; there was no other way out. ""If that is the decision you have made for me, dearest Papa, then please allow me to speak a few more words with my dearest Mother.""  Klytemnestra held onto Iphigenia with such strength, afraid that if she let go, she would never see her daughter again. ""Do not weep for me, Mother. This is my fate, and at least I hope I will be able to help our soldiers. Do not forget me; always remember my love, the deepest love a daughter could have for her parents. Take care of my brother and sisters.""  As the words fell, Iphigenia kissed her mother for the last time and she stood up to follow her father out of the house. Klytemnestra tried to shout out Iphigenia's name but the words got stuck in her throat. She struggled to grasp her daughter's wrist but failed.  Iphigenia glanced back at her one last time, ""Farewell, my dearest Mama.""  The immense grief engulfed Klytemnestra. She wanted to follow her daughter to the altar but found every drop of her strength had left her body. She could no longer cry, for there was only a hollow inside her. Her body was shivering and her fingers were all cold. She feels immediately sick. She can still recall the warmth of her daughter's hand. Everything in this room reminds her of Iphigenia.  How can I live when I go back to Mycenae? How can I travel with the horse-drawn carriage, the same carriage we used when we first came here? I should have asked Iphigenia to stay in the palace... Klytemnestra stayed in the house for hours, with nothing to do but reminisce about the memories of her daughter. Agamemnon came in once to demand she go back home. The king had already put on full armour, so Klytemnestra knew it was time to leave this place.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Klytemnestra had been ruling the kingdom for nearly a decade.  People were willing to recognize her as the new ruler since Agamemnon had gone to war. But she was a woman after all--therefore she needed support from other royal members, particularly Aegisthus, the cousin of Agamemnon. For a long time, their collaboration had been peaceful and uneventful. However, there was always a plan in Klytemnestra's mind. She had been thinking about this plan for ten long years, biding her time. She was the daughter of Tyndareus and Leda; she certainly was a clever woman who knew how to hide her emotions. And Aegisthus barely participated in making decisions. He was exactly the one Klytemnestra needed.  After all this time, the gods handed her a perfect chance.  ""Victory belongs to us!"" Klytemnestra turned to her people and announced the delightful news to them. ""Our king, my husband Agamemnon, sent us the message through Hephaestus' flame. Each beacon carried the fire from Ida[4], all the way to the house of Atreus."" People began to cheer and celebrate, and some started crying.  Everyone had been waiting for this moment for so long.  Immediately after the announcement, a sacrifice was arranged. Sheep and (Sleek heifers[5]) were prepared, waiting for the queen to start the ritual. Women were all following Klytemnestra, as they brought the woven peplos for the goddess. Aromatic wines were poured into the cups and ready for libation. People were excited. Klytemnestra tried not to recall that sacrifice that had once pierced her heart. She couldn't even stand by herself and face the whole ritual at that time; but now, she was watching animals get ripped apart[6] without any hesitation.  She won't let anything similar to that happen again.  After the celebration ended, Klytemnestra turned back to the palace, asking servants for details for a specific task: ""How are my children?"" A part of her heart trembled at this word. My children. She forced herself to stop thinking about it. Very soon someone respectfully replies, ""To the daughter of Tyndareus, queen of Mycenae, they are doing great and have settled down in the places you chose for them.""  ""Very well,"" said Klytemnestra, with satisfaction. This was the first step of her plan. She needed to send all their children away from the palace, probably for a few months, to ensure their safety. The rest of the plan could wait until Agamemnon returned from Troy.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  King Agamemnon returned a few weeks after people received the news. He went back with so much glory that everyone was proud of him and the Greek army. Klytemnestra bowed to him, showing respect and love with all the luxurious candles and tapestries. Of course, she did not really mean that; these are the gifts tainted with hostility. She nearly sneered openly.  There was another girl--Kassandra, brought with Agamemnon from Troy. The king commanded servants to treat her as a guest, so Klytemnestra greeted her herself. She neither envied nor resented the girl. She was just curious--how would this 'war prize' react, after she fulfilled her plan? No one could understand the words of this former princess of Troy, so soon enough she was left all by herself in the palace. Klytemnestra took her leave to continue accompanying the king.  ""My king, you must be tired."" Klytemnestra smiled gently at Agamemnon and guided him to the bath. ""Please have a rest and take a bath!"" Agamemnon looked surprised and pleased; he was more than happy to be led to the bathhouse by Klytemnestra.  ""The water is ready,"" Klytemnestra said, feeling a surge of excitement. Her hands were trembling slightly and her heart beat rapidly. She tried her best to conceal it, hoping the king would not find out. And--one, two, three. Now was the time! Klytemnestra quickly wrapped the king in a robe--a robe that was so tight and not convenient to take off. Agamemnon appeared shocked and confused, but he did not have a chance to ask.  ""In case you are wondering, this is for Iphigenia."" Klytemnestra did not miss the fear in Agamemnon's eyes, even though it lasted for only a short time. The king began to grasp what would happen to him. His pupils shrank in fear as he struggled within her trap. But it was too late. Klytemnestra raised her weapon with the enjoyment of vengeance. The weapon, which she had hidden long before Agamemnon arrived.  Then...  Shunk, Shunk, Shunk...  Three sounds of stabbing and a long sound of howling. Agamemnon lay heavily in the bathtub, blood staining the entire pool.  ""...and you,"" Klytemnestra says, turning around and finding Kassandra. For some reason, the girl appeared here, witnessing the scene of the murder. ""Give me a reason not to kill you."" Klytemnestra casually wiped the blood off her clothes and skin, and then tightened her hand on the weapon, ""For you are from my enemy's side.""  Surprisingly, the former Trojan princess laughed. She did not look at Klytemnestra; instead, her gaze was fixed on the dead body, and she seemed to mutter some words quietly: ""...now my duty is truly done. I have made my revenge, though through another woman."" Then she walked towards Klytemnestra, with the flames of madness burning in her eyes, ""I have seen all--at least I will die with the satisfaction of revenge!""   ...  Voices slowly gathered on the other side of the door; the court elders must have heard the commotion inside the bathhouse.  Klytemnestra calmly lowered her weapon. Her mind wandered, recalling the old memory of when her daughter was taken away for sacrifice. Back then, the only thing she knew was how to cry.  I have to find Aegisthus, Klytemnestra thinks. That would be the final step of the plan--he will be the new king, but I will be one with the real power.  She glanced at the two bodies on the ground, and a small smile appeared on her face.

And Orpheus was sick of singing.  He had gone down.   He had come back.  He had stepped into the light--and turned.   Forgetting, after the eternal walk, that Eurydice was still in the darkness.   Her silent shadow smiled at him, forgiving.  And his beloved fell below forevermore.      Orpheus gave up his craft.   He had been great, once, but singing had not saved her. Singing would not save him.   The rumours spread. He had traded his voice to a god to restore her, he had lost his voice from sadness alone, he had never been all that good anyway.      Truth lay in the quietest places.   Orpheus had grown used to singing with Eurydice. Nightly duets, dancing and singing until their voices and their legs gave out.   Everything sounded different now, without her.      They had been Orpheus and Eurydice, and now he was Orpheus alone. He fell from favour in the eyes of his fans and his friends, no longer willing to perform for them.     Some, though, did not care what he was willing to do. The Maenads, followers of great Dionysus, begged Orpheus to sing for them, to love them. He refused.      Orpheus returned to his mother Calliope, who consoled him in his grief. He turned, too, to Apollo, waking each dawn to admire the rising sun. He found solace in the god who had once granted him his music.      Jealous Dionysus offered Orpheus wine, love, treasures beyond any he had seen before. But Orpheus refused, tired of the endless revels he had once played his music for. This angered Dionysus, and he ordered the Maenads, already frenzied by Orpheus's rejection, to tear the former musician to pieces. Orpheus, thinking of his lover in the underworld, did not struggle.      When the deed was done, the Maenads feared the repercussions of their murder. They threw the pieces of Orpheus into the river, and he was taken by the water.      His pieces made their way to Calliope, who cried and cried for her lost son. She stitched him together and buried him next to his wife, and so they became Orpheus and Eurydice once more.      Above, there was grief for the once-great musician. But down in Elysium, Eurydice was reunited with her love, and the eternal night rang with their voices entwined. ";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;fuzzy

The Sea, jealous of Wisdom, fought for the city but was unable to take it within its grasp. Wisdom proudly took over the lands, naming them after her, where people prospered under her intelligence and creativity.  Many years later a young girl joined Wisdom's temple to be a part of her priestesses as no man could enter her temple. Wisdom protected those girls and women from the men they could not escape for if they tried to enter she would smite them from which they stood. The young girl loved the temple filled with warmth and love from the other priestesses she met. Yet she was not whole, she longed for more a glimpse of hope or love but she knew she could never get it.  Days turned to months and months to years, the girl grew into a beautiful young woman captivating the hearts of many but most of all Wisdom as she watched her from Mt. Olympus. The young woman was kind to all giving when she could and always taking care of the others at the temple. Wisdoms interest grew soon leaving her longing for a chance to speak to the young woman that brought light to her life. Little did Wisdom know that Sea was also watching the young woman noticing her beauty as well as Wisdom's interest in her plotting ways to make the young woman his.  One day Wisdom's dream came true as the young woman knelt at her altar alone. Wisdom went to meet this woman and how glorious she was, kind yet cunning, strong yet beautiful, she was everything Wisdom ever wanted and the young woman wanted Wisdom for herself as their love blossomed under the blessings of a certain Goddess. Sea's anger grew to a boil once he learned of Wisdom and her new found lover, hatred raised the sea to meet the lands of the city yet a flood did not come. Sea's plan grew and took shape as he traveled to Wisdom's temple for her lover.  Sea crashed into the temple filling it with water inducing panic in all those inside but Sea let the water seep back before it killed. Sea tore through faces before he found Wisdoms new lover, her face was struck with panic as Sea beckoned for her to come to him. She obeyed but only out of fear, kneeling before Sea, she pondered how she got here before Sea took her face in his hand pulling up to face him. The young woman knew of cruelty and lust yet never had she seen it like this on the face of Sea. The young woman knew of Wisdom and Sea's rivalry yet she never thought she would become a player in the obscene games they played.  Sea took in the young woman's face and how lovely she was before he pulled her up dragging her deeper into the temple. The young woman tried to free herself from Sea yet she was only mortal, weak against Sea's power.  *****  Upon the altar the Wisdom first met her lover Sea took to defying her as she pleaded for him to stop.  ****  Wisdom could no longer watch as she descended to Sea and her lover, Wisdom banished Sea from her temple taking her poor lover in her arms in protection. Wisdom called that Sea be punished for his deeds yet as he was Thunder's brother Posiden he went unpunished. Wisdom or Athena, as she was known fondly by the young woman, Medusa, decided to protect her lover by bestowing gifts of impenetrable skin, eyes that could see no matter the light, venomous teeth to bit her enemies, immortality in a sense, and talons that could perce anything. Athena made her lover deadly yet beautiful all the same.  Mesmerized Medusa looked at her reflection her hair fell softly around her heart-shaped face as her eyes glittered green with cat-like pupils her nails had lengthen and her skin was still pale yet took on a rougher texture she smiled then letting her now sharper teeth shimmer before kissing Athena in gratitude and relief that she did not abandon her. Then Athena told Medusa that if a man looked at her he would turn to stone god or mortal to keep her safe. Athena took her to a beautiful beach far away from any known lands where mortals and gods could not find her. They would spend days laying together on the beach building a lovely home of marble and olive trees.  Athena would leave her lover for heroes that needed her help yet would always come back to Medusa. Years passed, a tale of a hideous monster that would turn everyone to stone spread through the lands as Posiden tried to sabotage Athena and Medusa's relationship. Many men were sent to slay Medusa only to be frozen in stone added to the lover's garden as decoration.  One day Thunder called Athena to Mt. Olympus to have her help his son defeat Medusa to claim victory and save his mother. Athena agreed to help the son yet not if it would kill her lover, Thunder angered by Athenas refusal claimed he would raise her cities spreading destruction and letting mortals curse her name till she faded from their minds. Athena was stuck, ending with her agreeing to help Thunder's son. She gave Thunder's son her shield with Hermes by her side to prevent anything that might deviate from Thunder's plan. Once Hermes went with Thunder's son she weeped for her lover's future, Athena could only hope that Medusa would live killing Thunder's son before he killed her.  Days passed before Athena could visit her lover at their secret beach as she touched down upon the warm sand. Something wasn't right. Athena called for Medusa but only the breeze answered her calls. She searched for her lover only to come across her mutilated corpse, head cleanly cut off and slashes upon her torso. Athena fell to her knees crawling to Medusa's body cradling it in her arms as she cried. She cursed Thunder and his son for the death of her beloved if only she could have done something, anything to save her.  Athena buried Medusa under their favorite tree in their garden of marble and olive before taking her place back upon Mt. Olympus, never offering help to any of Thunder's children again for the loss of her love. Thunder would tell the story of his son, Perceus saving his mother by beheading a disgusting monster that could turn men to stone with a glance and gifting it to her tormentor and his cronies. As well as how he saved a beautiful princess marrying her and spending their days together but never the love story of Athena and Medusa, lovers forever separated by the jealousy of Thunder or Zeus and Poseidon.;;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;1;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;semantic

An unfamiliar sensation gripped his heart. It was named fear, and he felt shame, for that scourge was only for the torment of mortals, not the immortal gods, and certainly not the one who was the greatest among them.  ""I am sure the crone is my jealous wife, Hera,"" he went on. ""She hates my mortal lovers and plots to ruin them and cause me pain. I have promised to grant you any boon, but do not ask this of me.""  But he saw that Semele's mind and body were saturated with curiosity. She'd told him what the old crone had said: if she experienced Zeus's fire when he lay with her, she would become immortal and her son greater even than his father.  So she stared at him implacably. She'd boxed him in handily, exactly as the crone had told her. ""You must beg for a boon and then pretend to disbelieve that he will honor his promise. He will swear by the River Styx, and such a vow is unbreakable,"" the wrinkled old hag with the fathomless eyes had said.  Zeus went on, struggling to convince her to withdraw her demand. ""The fullness of my godly light and fire is many times greater even than that of Apollo, the sun, in his chariot at high noon. As you know, no mortal may look upon the chariot of the sun without burning out their eyes. You will surely perish if I come to you as I am on Olympus.""  Semele wanted the immortality the hag had promised Zeus could give her. ""On your son whom I carry within my womb, Zeus, I insist that you do as you promised. You swore on the river Styx, and nothing is more powerful than that, for everyone will cross it eventually, although mortals eons sooner than gods and titans.""  She opened her robes, showing him her body, which glowed with the power of their son within her. Zeus knew he had lost to his clever wife. But he thought he might yet salvage something from this tragic situation. He covered Semele, and entered her, and let forth the full power of his desire.  She cried out in climax, but then his divine lightning struck, searing the land for miles around.  ~~~  Zeus wept tears as he carried the lifeless body of his lover to a pond where he might wash her and prepare her for her journey across the river he had sworn upon. She had been unable to withstand his glory, just as he had feared.  The presence of his son in her womb had protected her body from the divine wind and fire, but her eyes had been burned out of her skull, leaving only charred sockets. And even if her brain might have survived, her mind could not have.  Zeus washed her body, cleaning it of the ashes that had rained down on them as fire consumed the tree they'd been lying under.  Then he turned to the gruesome task of opening her belly to rescue his son, whose mind Zeus could feel struggling for freedom.  The child was still incomplete, a fetus less than a handspan in length. His veins under the translucent skin resembled the grapevines that yielded wine, succor and temptation of men and gods alike. The mark of a panther's paw was upon his forehead. When Zeus severed the umbilical cord, a green gem took its place.  The next step was excruciating even to the greatest of the gods. Gritting his teeth, Zeus slit open his scrotum with a knife fashioned by Hephaestus from a ruby. So great was his cry of pain that an earthquake shook the island on which he sat with the dead body of his lover and his living son, who would be known as the twice-born. Tsunamis tore across the sea in all directions, swamping coastal cities and capsizing swift ships. Even Apollo, the sun, now riding far away to the west, heard the cry of Zeus and wondered what it meant.  Once he had his son safely stowed, he sewed up his organ of generation, using a needle made of sapphire and a thread unwoven from his tunic, and his tears of pain came to earth in a thunderous downpour, while branching lightning split trees across the island straight down to the roots.  His and Semele's son would be fed by the seed of his father before his second birth, and would thus count great powers of fertility among his blessings to bestow.  Zeus began climbing the great stairs to Mount Olympus, wincing with each step. He hurt now, but the immortals healed quickly. And it would all be worth it to see the look on Hera's face when she realized what he had done.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

He looked presumptuously confident and stupid, with his golden hair and horse-drawn chariot floating gracefully from the sky. If I were with my friends from the village, they would fall to their knees and pray to the God Apollo for being so kind as to visit them. They couldn't be more stupid.     When his chariot touched the ground, it was as if the air stilled, all of the bees buzzing, the saccharine smell of the flowers, and the light breeze brushing my cheeks refused to move. Warmth clung to my skin, and the wind carried the salty smell of the sea.          ""My son! I have brought a gift for you!"" He ran a hand through my hair, the other hidden behind his large torso. Red cloth was hidden under bronze armor, a symbol of the sun plated on his chest. He was sinewy in a way no mortal could ever achieve as if his every muscle was carved from the finest marble.           ""Pater, you did not have to get me anything. It is nice enough to see you after you have been in Olympus for so long.""          ""Nonsense, my boy, you deserve such a gift, for you are the son of Apollo! My Orpheus, with all my best qualities and, hopefully, my good musical skill."" His voice was gruff as it spewed compliments, which I was sure I did not deserve. The moment's suspense vanished as he revealed an intricate instrument with strings pulled tight between its tan frame. ""It is a lyre, my son; sit, and I will show you how to play it."" The log scratched against the back of my thighs, the sweet sap clinging greedily to my tunic.      Pater's hands moved over my own gently as he directed the fundamental teachings. It was as if his hands were the only mechanism designed to play this instrument, to coax such a sweet sound out of something so tense. My fingers strummed along with his, never entirely placing them right to copy the charming sound. The way mine fiddled made the strings crack.           Pater did not seem impressed with how I did my best to mimic him, with how I puffed out my chest to attempt to stand as tall as him. No matter how much I breathe in and provide air to my stomach, I can never fully encompass everything as he does.     He enraptured anything and everything; the healthy, yellowish ochre that subdued his skin made him shine so much more than me in every sense. Being a God meant he was more significant than any life in Greece, and his reluctant neglect always reminded me of that. He was here when he wanted to be but never when I needed him.     ""Good, my son. Not great, but good. Much better than the other mortals."" His dark skin, tanned to a deep bronze from his many hours coaching the sun through cerulean skies, looked strange against mine. Not because the colors were so similar but because his touch was too foreign to feel normal.     ""Thank you, Pater."" For a god of the thing that heats all of Greece, he certainly does not enjoy giving the same attention to me.     ""Take care of your mother, Orpheus. She is a good woman."" My mother has always waited for him, no matter how long he has avoided her. In her eyes, if he meets with me, he still loves her. How stupid is she? He doesn't even love his son. He loves the attention and mimicking because it feeds his godly ego.     With that, he leaves me on the log, with the lyre in my hand, and descends to the sky on his chariot. I've always wanted to be close enough to him to see how he moves the sun in such patient increments, but instead of being able to see him, the sun's iridescent yellow streaks block my vision.     Against my bare feet, the road leading home is chalky and dry dirt, jamming into the cracks on my heels that have taken form over the long summers. The road's ruts, designed for the merchant's carts, make me feel like a bobbing line trying to draw fish in.     The market is closing for the day, and people are going home to their families and lives that I envy. One's with fathers who do not direct the bright sun to shadow me as his shame and mothers who refuse to see the earth and its gods for what they truly are.    I blend into the hordes rushing home, snagging a ripe fig from the first street stall I see. Money is not one of all the gifts my father has given me. It's too much of an earthly concern.     My teeth sink into the plush fruit, and warm, sticky juice cascades down my chin. The skin is bitter, a direct contrast to the obscenely sweet inside, and when it touches my tongue, my jaw twinges.     I follow the crowd, my chest surging with the need for something distracting and not wanting to return home to my mother and her questions about my father. She is obsessed with the fact that Apollo had chosen her once upon a time and naively forgets that he continuously treats us as nothing but his mortal play toys.     The hordes of people are not migrating to the cottages, though. They are trickling into the amphitheater, sitting on the rising seats one by one, making the oval shape appear more rounded as their bodies buzz excitedly. My fig is only one bite in, and a show is forming.     Mystical colors draped over men's bodies infiltrate the monochrome gray of the stage, and the people in the crowd watch in amazement. The actors on the stage converse with each other in hushed tones, their muscular builds bumping into one another as they huddle.     My seat is at the theater's very back and upper part, the setting sun's last embers striving to reach my shoulders. The atmosphere is hot, the air between everyone doused with an electric crackle of anticipation.     The very minute the men begin performing in all their draperies and thunderous tones is when the crowd silences, not even a whisper being muttered on their lips. The play is fine, the music good, but something is amiss. No one seems to care about their craft, about toning it to perfection. I almost wish to laugh at them, but everyone else seems too enthralled with the menial performance to pay that much attention to me.     My attention is drawn from the stage when a melodic laugh rings out, sounding more in tune than my father's fingers on the lyre. The fig falls from my hand, smattering on the top of my feet with a wet smack and coating them in the sticky juice.     Her hair is black like a night sky, but her velvety skin is subdued with a pale pink underwash. Her body flows into soft folds and rounded features, everything about her intricately placed as if designed by Aphrodite. I know of her vaguely, as the town's matrons talk about her and how none of them know where she comes from, but they do know her name. Eurydice.      For the remainder of this part, my eyes never left her. Even when the acting improved, she was the show's star with her effortless beauty and... very full coin byrsa. It was a pretty little thing, made of leather and folded into her robes' soft, deep purple linen. It would be degradingly easy to snatch off her hip if I was able to get close enough.     Money fuels people, even if how they get it taints their souls and drags on their minds. I don't want to rob her of something so familiar as money, but it is the one thing I need to survive on this earth.     The lyre was heavy in my hand, and the splattered fig juice stained the skin of my feet to a reddish-brown color. It forced the dirt kicked up by the audience to stick and collect in clusters of irritating grains.      Infiltrating the orchestra is the easiest part, sitting amongst the other lyres and ducking my head from the beautiful woman's view. It looked like I was just late to the performance, scuffling amongst the other boys with instruments and finding an empty sack full of straw to rest on. Bony knees and elbows collide, a sign of youth and a reminder that we are much lesser physically than the fathers we have adored.     My father infiltrates everything, even the beautiful woman. The laurel leaves on her head are a potent reminder of how he is embedded in the stories of Greece and praised as giving life to us in the form of the sun.     Once the music begins, it's the only thing my ears will allow me to hear and mimic. Each musical note seems to come alive, ascend to my ears, and fill my chest with adrenaline. A block of too-thick air stopped me from breathing too profoundly, slowly morphing the adrenaline into intense anxiety.     My fingers ache from the strings of the lyre, each bound wire digging into my fingertips when I pull at them. My forearms burn from the constant traction of plucking and pushing, and I am drowning in the music and striving to create my best work.     My efforts feel like they are for naught when I realize the other boys have put their instruments in the cradles of their laps, their necks craning to look at how I play. The actors stopped acting, the crowds stopped jeering, and even the woman stopped laughing.     For once in my life, I am not overshadowed by my father. I am bathed in the night, away from his eyes and his sun, basking in their attention for something I could do instead of feeling like I was merely a dented trophy of my father's.      The song tapered off, my arms and fingers not feeling the intense need to keep creating beautiful noise. My body feels hot, sweat trickling down into my toga's neck and staining it to a deep white.   Embarrassment unblocks the air in my throat, all of the oxygen I had missed in the throes of needy passion suddenly invading my lungs. The show feels disrupted, the comedic flow of the night trickling away as the extended silence ebbs through the amphitheater.     I was standing, a nervous ball of too-thin knees and knobby elbows. I mumbled my apologies, the curve of the lyre's wood coarse against the veins of my wrist as I wrenched a handout and ripped the coin purse from the woman's belt. It was a violent motion that not even the stupidest of people could mistake my actions for anything less than malicious.     I rush out of the amphitheater under the main awning, a hot ball of guilt forming in my stomach and my fingers clenching the bag so tightly that my nails create crescent moons in my palms. I can hear her yell to come back, to give her the coin purse like a siren when it drags the men to the depths. She wasn't just pretty. She was vaguely threatening as she chased me.     It's hot in the way that spilled wine sticks to a table, invading the splinters with its stickiness. The heat clings to the crevices of your skin in a way that one will never get clean, and sweat cascades down every inch of my body, making me feel slimy.     Small pebbles cut into my feet and kicked-up dirt plumes made my legs' skin dry. Looking over my shoulder, the fabric of her skirt was bunched around her hands in thick whorls, revealing thick leather sandals that pounded the ground as she chased me.     She wanted this back, and I couldn't let her have it. I needed it.     The distance between us lessened as every muscle in my body tired, the lyre and coin bag dragging my arms down. I could only think selfishly of myself and my mother and how this much money would fix so many problems instead of thinking about what would happen to this young woman if she lost it.     Rounding a corner, my heart beat inside my chest faster than my feet hit the ground. The streets were getting more corrugated as we delved into the dingier parts of town, the extravagant temples and amphitheaters turning into dirty cottages and starving children playing with sticks on the side of the road.     In my sweat-polluted toga and rawboned body, I looked as if I belonged. Looking like she was Greek royalty, Eurydice seemed out of place, her angered face and potent emotions rolling off her in waves. The people in this part of the city don't care, for they have figured that the Gods have already given up on them, so her ardor only adds to her transcending from the crowd.       My chest concaves with every breath, allowing every sharp intake to dig deep into my lungs. My calves and fingers ache, but she is so close to me. If she reached a hand out, she could rip me back and get what she wanted.     My legs quake underneath me, threatening to snap like toothpicks, and I don't dare take another step. I am overexerted, yet as she stops, she seems as if it is rejuvenating for her. She stands tall, the bundles of her skirt falling from her hands and looping around her feet in plum waterfalls. I somehow ended up on the ground, cradling my arms to my chest and leaving the bag and the lyre in the dirt. There is an uncomfortable pinch on my dry knees, but I am unsure if it is internal or external.     She looks warm, with the glow from the moonlight making her skin shine over the rosy hue that covers every inch of her body. She shines like my father, almost in a Godly way, and something about her makes me feel less than. She gives off this feeling of exuberance that encompasses not only her but the very air and grass under her feet.     ""Give it back."" She demanded, her tone cold and entirely different from how she had been in the amphitheater. ""Now, young man. You can make your living with that lyre. You don't need to steal from me.""     The more she spoke, the more beautiful I realized she was. Her hand was hoisted down at me expectantly, even though she could lean down to pick it up.     ""Ma'am, I cannot give it back. If I could, I would.""     ""You can, and you will. Put it in my hand."" I don't know why she is so adamant that I give it back to her; maybe it's some sick sense of a power move.     ""Ma'am, please, I need this money."" I feel pathetic, my hands shaking as I wiggle my fingers closer to the bag in a desperate attempt to retrieve it. She could have taken it, but she didn't. She wanted me to serve her like she was some kind of God.     ""I said give it back, small boy. I will not beg you to return what is mine."" Her voice was barely above a whisper, but her face was smooth as silk. The only indication that she was less than perfect was the tiny pinch of her brow and the scanty frown of her lips.    ""And I said I needed it."" I am all arrogance and hubris, demanding something of her that I did not deserve to take.    My hand wraps around the bag's opening, feeling smooth leather and cording, and I try to drag it toward me. This action is counteracted by her foot stomping on my hand, crunching down until my fingers make grotesque popping noises. My jaw clenches in absolute pain, but I don't allow myself to cry. That would give her too much power.     On the dirt path, weaving around rocks, something sleek and scaly bridles up to her ankle, wrapping itself around the foot she was holding herself up with. A snake, its eyes charging into the tiniest of slits, reared its menacing head back. Before I could stop it, sharp teeth were brutally digging into her skin, forcing crimson blood out of two round holes. It was so dark that it almost looked violet.     Her shrill scream pierced the air, the pain too much for her to bear. Her pain morphed her cold face into one full of heat, with flushed cheeks and a sneer so hideous that it would rival Medusa's. The snake pulled away after draining its venom into her, the leftover clear liquid infusing itself with the free-flowing blood.     As she fell to the earth, her God-like shine drained away from her face. I couldn't move fast enough to catch her, so dust rose around where her body had fallen in thick plumes. Straggling over her, I brushed dark, thin strands of hair away from her placid face.          She was dead. She had to be. Her fixed gaze rested on the moon, but the vivid spark of her eyes and easy smile were gone. Nothing was left of the woman I had robbed, and her brightness was taken from the world.     Guilt forms in my stomach as a ball of a black, hot, stenchy substance, and my eyes water incredulously. I blamed myself for the death of this girl who had been so full of life and had been trying to live the best she could until I obstructed that. My tears soaked into her robes, and my fingers held her skin that was chilling by the second.     I couldn't manage to stop crying, even when I felt the presence of something otherworldly and heat similar to the sun's basking on my shoulders. Turning from her body, from where her soul had fizzled into the dirt of the earth and the underworld, I saw my father. He didn't touch me or try to provide any comfort. He was standing there while I was at his feet, mourning over a woman I didn't know. I don't know why or where he got the audacity to show up here and now.     ""Pater?"" My voice cracked, my brown eyes red and teary.     ""My son! Get up. Stop mourning her! She was just a wood nymph! I sent the snake to protect you. I thought you'd be happy and running off to pay your mother's debts!"" His boisterous laughter filled the air, and even in the night, he shone. Her being a wood nymph explained her attitude and how she absorbed all of my attention, but did she deserve to die for this?     ""She didn't deserve that! I was the one that stole from her!"" I stood, my legs still recovering from running and shaking. ""You killed her for fighting for what is rightfully hers! You should have killed me!"" My father has a very distorted sense of right and wrong, thinking that what is his is the only thing that matters.     ""My son, you are blinded by Eros! She was pretty but not a thing to be blinded over,"" His voice was calm and collected, his smile never leaving his face. He was so sure that he was right.     ""Father, I do not have to love her to realize she didn't deserve that! Where is your humanity?"" He reared back, the smile turning into a sneer, revealing a thin row of his teeth. His hand looked as if it itched to rise, jumping at his side and pinching at his tunic.     ""I am no human! I do not have their insipid values or their mortal beliefs. You are a fool, Orpheus, and you must realize you are my son. You are a demigod! Start acting like one."" He went to turn from me, to vanish to Olympus again, but I grabbed his shoulder. Fear spiked in my chest when I saw his clenched jaw and cheeks flushed from anger.     ""Send me down there so I can retrieve her. I know you can."" On any mortal, the intense pressure of my nails on their skin would mar them and create blood, but my father stood tall and unflinching.     ""No, my son. I just protected you. I will not send you down there to die,"" His tone revealed that he did mean his words, even if they were full of anger. I departed from his shoulder to retrieve a coin from the bag to pay Chiron to pass the river Styx and the lyre. It has become comfortable in my hand and is my only notable earthly possession, so I decide to take it.     ""You told me to start acting like a demigod. Allow me to rival Hercules' courage, to brave the monsters like Perseus, or even become great only to die like Achilles!"" My father was not satisfied with only me; he wanted me to be great, and the myths told throughout my childhood allowed me to beg to be better and satisfy that need of his.     ""Fine, son. But if you do not come back, I warned you. The underworld is a not so forgiving place."" His rage cooled in front of my eyes, and the red tint of his skin was completely gone. He was more ominous than angered.         His hands flicked, orange sparks of what seemed to be sunshine crawling up his arms and encompassing his shoulders. It breathed a new kind of life into the space around us, charging it with energy and sounding like it was heaving for air. The sparks fan out into hot flames, engulfing both of us until all I could see was orange. I immediately start sweating, but my father appears to be in his element in this heat, the flames cradling him like they are cherishing him.     A large circle of black appears in front of me, tendrils of cold air curling out from it. I stand on my toes to push just past the edge, my eyes instantly seeing lines of men, women, and children with coins piled in their hands and waiting for their turn to cross the river Styx. Some look as if they are still alive, with flushed cheeks and full bodies, while others look hollow.     ""Go. Hades awaits you."" My father whispers, his muscles tensing as the black circle wavers. The obscene roundness started fading as the curves became fuzzy, black bleeding into the orange flames. Whether he was struggling to contain it or struggling to keep it alive, I am not sure.     It is cold. For some reason, I expected it to be swelteringly hot. The dirt down here flies around heads and curls around limbs as if inspecting everyone before allowing them entry to its home, and the souls of what once were people seem irritated by it. There are no plants or sun, just endless miles of cold desert dirt and gray sky.     There is no trace of the sun that my father so desperately loves, and the darkness down here is welcoming.     Traversing the line of souls revealed that they were only a mist that came apart when touched, only to float back together again. I pushed my way to the front, feeling the cold spray of the Styx on my feet. It washed away the dirt, and the fig juice in small splatters, and the water of the shore rippled as a wooden boat approached.     I look up, chills running along my spine as my eyes connect with his. Chiron is tall but hunched, with a curved nose and blue eyes that resemble the bright Greek oceans. His dark cloak pools around his feet and in the boat, his sleeves falling back to reveal pale skin and hands clenched around a wooden stick that delves into the water.     He makes the idea that I may die down here real.     ""You are alive. I can smell it on you, and it reeks."" His voice is gravelly and deep, coming out of cracked lips.     ""I just need to retrieve someone, and then I will return."" His eyes narrow into thin slits of blue. I tuck the lyre into my belt so that I do not have to hold it in my hand and have it drag me down.     ""Hades will not allow you to steal someone back from his realm.""     ""I just need passage,"" I say, handing him the coin. It is warmed by my living hands, not as cold as the ones he usually gets, but he accepts it regardless. Along with some others, I board the small craft, journeying across the black depths. I can't hear anything besides my breathing in the middle of the river. The water seems to be rushing under the boat in fast currents, but it is so quiet.     On the other side of the river, I am greeted with dry, brown grass crunching under my naked feet. This side is cold as well, a result of being hidden from the sun. It is a comfortable solace to know my father could not see me down here, even if he tried.     Some houses appear to be made of mud, with straw roofs and souls of women gabbing on the porches. They almost look alive, their heads clustered together and their hands clenched around the stems of kylix drinking cups, but they are transparent and misty. They are conceivable and can touch but appear less solid.     Looking past them, a long road paved with dark cobbles winds to an imposing temple made of black marble. There is no light to reflect off it, making it all the more imposing. Eurydice, with all of her vengeance and fight, would not be down here with the matrons. She would be up there with Hades, either picking a fight or enjoying the afterlife with all she had.     Dead trees, charred with a black crust, are dusted with the gray ash falling from the sky. The smell of mold jams into my nose, making my stomach flop like a fish. I could vomit, but something told me it wouldn't make the anxious feeling go away.     Three small dogs sit at the temple outside the massive arched doorways. I only see one tail wagging away, and all three tongues loll out of their slobbery mouths. I lean on my knees, wishing to absorb their cheery attitude through touch, but they roll onto their back... and there is only one small body. It is lumpy and a dirty tan color, with 4 petite legs, but it is only one.     I rip my hand back, fear swallowing me whole, while the puppy rolls back onto his stomach. He seems happy to be getting any attention, even if that is born of fear. I tentatively pat his head and stand, pushing all my fear into a box in my chest.     ""Good boy."" He may be strange, but he is cute.          Inside this temple, pillars line the sides, some cut in half to hold dishes of fire, and piles of bones line the floor. The dingy lighting exemplifies the macabre scenery, with dead flowers on the giant stage-like steps like an offering. There is a large, spiky throne directly in the middle of this palace, with men and women so beautiful around it that the poets down here will never lack a muse.     ""Boy,"" A dark voice booms into the corridor and echoes into my ears, ""You are still alive."" Looking at the throne, a man more significant than even my father sits. He has inky black hair and pale skin, a long face, and sharp features. He isn't as muscular as my father; he looks lankier and more malnourished, but his spindly legs prove his height.     I see Eurydice peeking out from behind the throne among the beautiful muses.     ""I came for her. She didn't deserve death."" I point at Eurydice, her blank expression morphing into one of disdain.     ""You would even steal death from me?"" She asks in a shrieky tone. Hades silences her with a bony finger in the air, the pointy tip of his nail tracing under her chin. I don't feel jealousy as I do not love her but fear for her soul. He can touch them as if they are more than a mist, which makes him terrifying.     ""You cannot take her. She is dead and therefore mine."" He eyes her side profile with a malicious grin.     ""I know. But she didn't deserve death. My father killed her for all the wrong reasons; I should be here, not her."" I twist my words using my antics, and Hades has that same haughtiness as my father. He is colder, having basked in icy death, while my father was warmer from the hours of sun.     His gaze goes to the lyre I tucked around my leather belt, making the fear trickle out of its box. I untuck it from my belt, wondering if I can trade.     ""I can offer this for her."" It would seem acceptable on earth to trade something material for a literal living soul, but Hades changes the rules to serve him in his realm. ""It is a gift from Apollo, so it is made better than any earthly one."" My voice cracks, feeling smoke curl around my legs. Looking down, my feet are still on the cold stone, but thick smoke covers them.     ""One cannot trade a soul for a lyre. One needs a soul for a soul,"" He whispers, leaning forward with an outstretched hand. The room around me seems lighter, as if what is wrapping around my legs is the room's shadows. ""How far are you willing to go to make things right?""     I feel the shadows trickling up my thighs, cold and threatening. It travels over my toga, trapping the fabric in an airtight seal. The dust around the line of souls waiting for Chiron wasn't blown dirt; it was his powers keeping track of who traveled here.      ""If I do this, will you allow her to return with no strings attached?"" With the gods, one has to be careful with how they word things. They are more intelligent than many mortals, leading to the myths our parents try to teach us to keep us alive.    ""Yes. She will go back to earth, body and soul."" His promise is followed by the smoke squeezing my wrists and forcing my hands to go cold. I drop the lyre from the pressure, hearing it clatter onto the floor. Smoke wraps around my bony shoulders and thin neck, menacingly sitting by my face. I gulp for air, but there isn't any left for me to take. No one down here needs it, so maybe I took all of the little amount for myself.     My heart is pumping. My teeth are grinding into one another. ""Send her back. Now."" I demand, and I can see his lips tip up. He keeps me in my position, but with a click of his fingers, bright lights flood my vision and blind me.          The next moments aren't painful. The lights fade away, replaced by comforting black, until I can open them again. My hands jitter, my teeth unclench, and I look down. Everything on me is washed in a bluey-white.     Hades smiles, his arms opening me as if he accepts my soul. I look around, and the room is dark once again. My body isn't behind me as I expected it to be, but I don't feel the same sensations that I did when I was alive. I don't feel my chest concave with breaths or feel anything physical.     It's all gone. Everything that I once considered normal was gone.     ""Thank you, Hades."" I pick up the lyre and walk over to his stage. It's fitting for a theatrical God to have such a display for him and his prizes. I am now nothing but another trophy for another God, but it is different. He will admit that he doesn't love me and obeyed my will once, unlike my father, who never did it at all.     ""I needed a musician."" He muses, and I sit where Eurydice had once stood. I am away from the sun, holding something that I can do, and I am guilt-free. I am not paying for my father's mishaps, and the woman who loved life was back where she needed to be.     So, I string out a note, Hades smiles, and the other trophies begin a song.  ";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

A smile was still on his face. His chest stayed still. The blood from his forehead dripped into my hand. Warm. The light in him was fading. No! No no no, this could not be. I tried to capture those lights, tried to hold them in my hands. I used my power of healing, broken bones were repaired and opened skin was closed. I sang, singing every song he liked. Why do they sound sorrowful ? My head dropped onto his chest, hoping to hear that rhythmic, strong heartbeat. Nothing. """;narrator;first;Hyacinthus;Hyacinth;;;;;Zephyrus;Discus;;;;;discus;Struck by discus;;;;;"Sun is rising. The cloud reflects some colors, mostly pink, but there are also a couple purple clouds that are turning red with the sun. I frown. I pick up my silver bow and aim at those clouds. The arrow breaks them into nothing.     So I was driving my swan chariot, passing through the sky, enjoying the little film happening on earth. Listen to the words they praised for me! Every day they sang my name, and sometimes I would grant them glories if their offerings pleased me. Look at them, a bunch of cowards, rather than fighting in a war, they left their children in hunger, sacrificed those plump sheep to me and hoped I would give them a little pity. Ha, how funny! When necessary, I indeed gave them a little hope, made one of them a hero, so the others would actually believe the same glory will shine on them! How foolish! They would never be loved by me, unless those special ones...   My eyes stopped on a young man. He was beautiful, more than beautiful, even more beautiful than some of the gods. His chestnut colored hair quivered in the wind, every tan skin and muscle showed his masculinity and strength. His brown eyes were determined and sharp as he swung the sword, and his motions were clean and steady.  I want to own him.   ""He is cute,"" Zephyrus, the west wind, appeared and smiled.  ""He is, and he will be glorified in my name,"" I was annoyed.  ""I do not think so. He will not be your pet just because you are the son of Zeus.""  ""We shall see.""  We both landed on the courtyard the young man was training at. I almost laughed at the look that he was giving, showing his terror.  He kneeled so fast and lowered his head, dropping his sword aside, ""Your honor, the great god of sun and archery, and the west wind.""  I grinned, ""get up, and tell me your name.""  I could tell he was scared, too scared to look at me, ""Your honor, I am Hyacinthus, the son of Pierus, the prince of Sparta.""  ""I said get up, mortal,"" I wanted to look at his face again.  ""Oh, my dear, do not be scared by him,"" Zephyrus went up and lifted his face, ""just be yourself.""  I frowned that Zephyrus contaminated his face, but Hyacinthus did look up. With this closer look, he was even more beautiful. Every line, every shape on his face rhymes perfectly. He looked straight into my eyes, fear and a little shine of the water in his eyes.  ""I gave you an offer,"" he shivered again when I spoke, ""you come on to my chariot, and in return, you will be honored in my name.""  ""I can show you everywhere in the world, and you will be remembered when the west wind blows,"" Zephyrus was pleased by his offering.  The mortal looked at Zephyrus, then turned to me. He stood up, I was better, or maybe it was the fear, he stepped to me, ""Thank you, the god of  sun and archery, for your kind offering,"" then he turned to Zephyrus, ""and thank you the west wind, I feel honored by you.""  Hyacinthus stepped onto my chariot, not with full confidence, but he was on it. I smiled at Zephyrus.  See, mortals know who will give them more. Then I stepped on to my swan chariot, not looking back at Zephyrus's swelled face. There might be a tornado tonight.        To make a person respect you, you must show them your power.   We were flying with my chariot, so silence in sound, but not silence inside.  ""Speak,"" I did not look at him, to show my carelessness.  ""Your honor, where are we heading?"" His voice was solid but lithe in the silence.  ""My lands.""  Followed by silence.  I turned to him. He was scared, again, so he stood up. He stood too quickly, so he lost his balance. He was about to fall out of my chariot. I grabbed him, pulling him back to the seat. His skin was rough by the training but soft and delicate.  ""Thank you, your--""  ""Thank me with your heart. We cannot be companions if you hold all your questions.""  Silence again. The silence was dragging me to anger. I could throw him from my chariot.  ""Companions?"" He finally spoke, ""No hard mission like slaying a dragon?""  I almost laughed, ""then the dragon would be dead already, no need for you to kill. Come, we arrived. This is one of my lands, Delphi.""  This was a wild highland of Delphi. I did not want anyone to interrupt us. Hyacinthus was amazed by the city below, by its prosperity.  ""Done, let us go to the next--""  ""Wait!"" I was surprised. A mortal interrupted me, but also I was surprised that I was not feeling mad at all. Hyacinthus seemed to notice what he had done, he lowered his head and remained quiet.  ""It will be ruder if you stop me for nothing.""  He was scared again, not knowing what to do, ""may I stay longer? Perhaps join the market?""  ""No,"" he must stick to my plan, so he will know how strong I am and feel honored and satisfied.  He looks scared again, but more upset this time.  ""Why do you show grief, mortal? Are you not happy that you came to Delphi, the sacred land of Apollo, with Apollo himself?""  ""I am happy, your honor, I am happy for your kindness. We may leave."" He lowered his head, trembling.  ""You dare to lie to a god and show fake gratefulness?"" I was angry, a foolish mortal again. He ruined everything, ""I have changed my mind, you will be sent back to Amyclae and never be loved by me--""  ""It was you who said we are companions! And you even do not know what a companion is! At least show me some respect!"" He ran down to the hill.  I was shocked. Never a mortal would rebel against me, never asking me for respect. Was not my notice of them the greatest respect? Why was he angry? He should be afraid in front of my anger.   I found him in the crowd. He was easy to find, among the ugly, small mortals.  ""Show me what companions do,"" there was no compromise, but only my interest in him.   ""Call me Hyacinthus, I have a name.""  ""Hyacinthus,"" my tongue was twisted maybe, I do not often say a mortal's name.  ""Greetings, Apollo,"" he looked back, not in fear, but with a smile, softer than the spring, fiercer than the summer. Brighter than ever.  I looked at him, then looked away. It was absurd to hear a faint, weak voice saying my name directly, but I felt no anger, my blood and heart were plumping faster, not knowing why.        Days, maybe months passed. Everything was following my plan, well, mostly. I showed him my silver bow and archery, granted him a little glimpse of the art of prophecy.  ""What prophecy do you see about me?"" Hyacinthus lowered my silver bow and asked.  ""A flower, a single stem and many little small flowers attached to it. Purple with red on the edge.""  ""Hmmm, it might be a flower you made for me.""  I smiled, not answering.  Most mortals praised me for my power of archery, and I was more known for it. Hyacinthus, instead, loved my music more than my power. I taught him how to play the lyre, his hands seemed small on my lyre. He played me a little piece, not refined, but it was good. Then I played to him. He closed his eyes, sinking in my music.   The time seems to freeze, sunbeams laid on his face, me playing my lyre and him being the audience. My impulses wanted to break through this moment. I moved closer. I kissed him on his forehead. He suddenly opened his eyes, blushing.  ""So what is that wreath on your head?"" He gave me an awkward smile.  I grinned at his little shyness, ""a laurel wreath, turned from a nymph named Daphne.""  ""What happened to her?"" He looks a little worried.  I told him how I made Ero, the love god, angry, then shoot me with my arrow to make me indulge in love with Daphne while she was shot to hate me. Finally, she turned into a laurel tree to escape from me. And there were more women who ran away from me for Ero's sake.  ""You never know how scared I am that you may be another scam of Ero.""  I mean it.  The feeling that I love those women but not loving them myself disgusted me.  Hyacinthus grinned, taking my hand to his chest. His rhythmic, strong heart beat with my impulses, my heart never beaten so fast. He closed his eyes, his lips met mine. My mind went blank, filled with him, his lips, his breath, his warmth,  his everything.  For the first time, something was not under my control.   He then let go, looking at me. His eyes glowed with the world, with me.  ""I am here. I am real.""     ""Here is Delos, where I was born."" We arrived at the last stop of my plan.  Hyacinthus was excited to see my past. His eyes shone with curiosity. He ran up to the cabinet, where I lived when I was still a young god. I stayed at the same place and watched him looking around. He put his hand on the wood door, he turned back and looked at me, "" you are not coming with me?""  I shook my head. Nothing in there was worthy for me to look at and recall. The past laid in the past, and I am no Apollo who I was.  Hyacinthus walked out from the cabinet, still with his curiosity, ""who owns the other bed? And that loom? You were a hunter?""  ""The other belongs to my sister, Artemis, goddess of wild animals and the hunt. Yes, we hunted in the woods a lot. And that loom belongs to my mother, Leto,"" I have not spoken that name for so long.  ""Well, then I must salute to your sister and mother, or I would be rude.""  ""No need, Artemis does not live here anymore, and Leto is dead,"" I paused and looked at him, he had a worried look on his face, ""She was killed by a serpent named Python, who was sent by Hera for her jealousy. No worries,"" I smiled at him, ""The serpent was killed by me when  I was still a child. You know, I am a good hunter.""  He looked at me, full of sorrow in his eyes. I did not quite understand why he was sad  about my mother's death, even I did not grieve for her death. It was normal that the gods fight each other for jealousy. The ones with no power will be the sacrifice of the fight, and the strong ones like me, will win and enjoy the glory.  No need to grieve for the forgotten.   Hyacinthus seems to see my confusion. He gave me a hug, his hands tapping on my back, our hearts joining each other. I felt something melting in my heart. Maybe  I was sad.   ""Come, bring me to my place,"" he stepped on the chariot.        ""Here, put this on,"" Hyacinthus handed me mortal clothes.  ""For what,"" I wore the clothes. The fabric was rough and the weaving was not fine. I felt uncomfortable and  ashamed.  God in mortal's clothes, what a joke. My skin will remember this disgrace forever.  ""You showed me your lands and your home, now it is my turn.""  I thought he was going to let me visit his palace house, showing his wealth among the rest. Instead, he brought me to the harbor, dirty, messy, and smelly.   Ships and vessels moored and settled sail. Mortals walked around, busy at their work. Sailors yelled to sail, sellers yelled for sale. Young mortal ran around, chasing for money and bread. Female mortals weaved in the shop and carried fabric around. Dogs and cats hid in the dark or found food in the trash. In those dim light allay, homeless mortals laid on the ground, hoping for a rescue.  Something stopped me from laughing at them.   ""Sorry for staining your deity, but this is us.""   Us. Mortals.  What was I hoping for, we would never be the same. We were born to be different, so we would live parallel, the lines that could be so close, but never intersect.  He then went on, fulfilling the duty of a future king. He granted bread and covers for those homeless, hopeless ones. He smiled at them and wished them a good day. I did not understand why he helped them. They were no use for this state. It was already a great mercy to leave them alive rather than killing them.  ""People are the core of a kingdom,"" Hyacinthus seemed to read my mind, ""a king is only powerful when he gets people to protect. Without them, a king is just a delicate egg shell,"" he looked at the cracked egg on the ground, ""Here, try it,"" he handed me some bread.  I found a woman, covered in a ragged cloth, sitting on the ground and begging for some change to live through the day. I thought I was standing close enough. This was absurd, all I needed to do was to throw the bread in front of her and leave, and she would be grateful for the bread falling from the sky. No need to have a fake smile. I looked at Hyacinthus, he gestured to me to squat. Squat? A graceful god never squatted, only laborers and mortals did that. With a sigh, I bent my knees and lowered myself to the same height as the woman. I was never this lowly, this would be the stain of my deity.  ""Mor-- Lady, wish you a nice day,""  I reached out my hand with the bread. I looked away, trying not to stare at her. This embarrassment was killing me.  ""Thank you! Oh thank you, kind young man,"" the woman looked up, staring straight into mine. There was liquid at the corner of her eyes. Her face was covered with wrinkles and scars, burn scars, beating scars. Her eyes were like a dead hollow, but I could see the reflection of my light. This horrible figure stabbed me like a knife, injecting a feeling of silver, pricking at my spine.  Guilt and apology.  Her two hands grabbing my arm, trembling, ""May the great god of sun bless you.""  I grinned, would I bless myself? I looked at Hyacinthus again. Maybe I would, ""May the god of sun bless you too,"" I put my hand on her shoulder, letting my power of healing flow in her. The wrinkles and scars slowly faded from her face. She smiled, like a yellow flower on the cactus in the middle of a desert. It bloomed in me, releasing a yellowish feeling mixed with the silver.  Joy and sadness.   I went back to Hyacinthus. The new feeling still remained in me. It pleased me but also discomforted me. I would say I was a little scared of this feeling.  Feeling mortal.    I did not look at him, pretending to speak delightfully.  ""I think there was some problem with her eyes, the liquid that I cannot heal.""  He laughed. His laughter made me laugh too, ""That is no disease, it is tears.""  ""What for?""  ""It cannot be described. Sometimes it is sorrow, sometimes joy, sometimes anger. It can barely be held by reason.""  Then I would never have a tear.  Nothing escapes my chess of reason.   We moved on. Let that silver yellow flow in me.   There was a miracle that happened in that harbor of Sparta.        The night fell. The stars hung above us, the trees hid their green, the owls stared their eyes in the darkness. Artemis was somewhere in the world hunting her prey.  ""Ah, what a nice day,"" Hyacinthus leaned on a rock. Dim light reflected on his visage, making his face more angular.  More beautiful than ever.  His eyes shone with the stars.  I sat beside him. The grass surrounding us was lit up by me, ""why is it nice?""  He glimpsed at me with a weird look, ""why are you always looking for a reason? There are many things that do not have a reason,"" he leaned towards me, so close that his breath touched my neck, ""but if you really want a reason--"" he bit my ear gently and retreated with his bright smile, but there was a little shyness this time.   ""Well, then this will be a nice day for me too,"" I turned to him, pressing my lips onto his. Why would I say that,  every day for me is the same.  But maybe these days did go well. Hyacinthus responded and pressed harder. Tonight,  it will be nice.        One good thing about being a god was that I did not need to sleep, but I could. Hyacinthus lay on my shoulder, his chest raised and fell along his breath. My head rested on his, I closed my eyes.  I was sitting on my bed, not the one in my palace, but the one in that cabinet on Delos. Everything was at their same place: my bed next to Artemis's, our desk for crafting weapons, and that loom covered in ashes that our mother used to weave at. I pushed the door open and saw the tree that Artemis and I used to target. At the bottom of that tree, there was a woman weaving.  ""Mother?""   The woman looked up, smiling at me.  I could not believe what I was seeing, no prophecy showed my mother was still alive. I walked faster and faster, and I ran. My body felt smaller and smaller - I was a child. I rushed to her, but I was tripped by a rock. Mother stood up and granted me a hand. She smiled, the smile that I remembered in my childhood, ""Here, Apollo, get up.""  I reached out my hand and tried to grab hers. Behind her, I glimpsed a slender figure - a serpent, curling on a branch, opened his mouth and bit mother's neck. Instinctively, mother fell on the ground. Her purple robe was soaked in her red blood.     Dead in that purple with the red on the edge.    ""Mother!' I screamed.  ""Apollo?"" Hyacinthus looked at me with worry, ""what was it?""  I opened my mouth, but the words stuck at my throat. When did I start to find comfort from mortals? I need no comfort at all. I shook my head and smiled, ""Minor things.""  Hyacinthus said nothing. The night went on, and I fell asleep again. In my half-consciousness,   I felt warmth , like I was held in my mother's arms.        The sun shone in front of us, the wind blew up the corner of his clothes against my skin.  Itchy.   ""You sure you wanna play discus with me?"" I looked at him, and could not believe a mortal who is shorter than me for a whole head dared to challenge a god.  ""Yeah, is there a problem?"" He looked up straight into my eyes. My light shone in his eyes, but his light never faded.   ""Sure, then show me what a mortal can do,"" I stepped backwards, holding the discus tight in my hand. I twisted my back, tensing up my muscles...    ""Ha,"" the moment I threw the discus, it disappeared in the light.  He narrowed his eyes to try to follow the discus, but he suddenly looked at me with that bright smile, ""write me a song if I catch it."" Then, he ran forward like an arrow of my bow, fast, clean, determined.  His muscles tightened to a gorgeous shape as he ran. He looks free, free from the world, free from being a mortal. He got further and further, becoming a little dot on the paint of blue sky and green grass. I never knew the power of nature itself. The sun stayed in the sky, clouds stopped their steps, trees and leaves remained where they were. Then all together, with a gust of west wind, quivering, trembling...     Wait.    ""Hyacinthus!"" I ran to him, as fast as I could, the wind crying and laughing besides my ears.  How could I, how could I not notice, how could I forget? Jealousy is their daily entertainment. If they cannot have it, then no one can. This was a game about me and Zephyrus, and the wager is Hyacinthus.  ""Run Apollo, run. We made a bet about you, and I say the discus is faster,"" Zephyrus laid in the air beside me, laughing harder and harder.  I am Apollo, son of Zeus and Leto, this kind of small breeze cannot stop me. The ground under my feet flew back. The discus carried by the west wind was still far up in the air. Closer and closer, I can almost touch him, touching  my sun ...   ""No no no, Apollo,"" a surge of west wind made me lose balance, ""the audience are glad to see the son of Zeus is defeated by a discus.""  Hyacinthus noticed my existence. He turned back and saw me sitting on the ground. He cannot see Zephyrus, neither hearing the wind, nor hearing me.  ""What,"" Hyacinthus laughed, laughing so hard that he could not even open his eyes, ""a god can fall on the ground too? Here, get up,"" he granted a hand to me. The sun shines behind him, but it seems like it is himself shining. For a moment, my mother was standing in front of me. I tried to reach for his hand, grabbing the light.  The discus was getting closer. I had no time. I did not care what power I was using. The grass was decaying but reviving again. Songs were sung and poems were told. Thousands of prophecies flew through my vision. I was standing up, it seemed like the pressure of the wind was weaker. I leaned forward, reaching to his arm.  So close!  My hand broke through the barrier of the wind, grabbing his hand.   A prophecy blinded my eyes.  The flower.   The discus rolled on the ground. Trees and grasses slowly danced in their tempo. Birds twittered on the branches. Sunshine spilled on us.  Warm.    He was in my arms. A smile was still on his face. His chest stayed still. The blood from his forehead dripped into my hand.  Warm.   The light in him was fading.    No! No no no, this could not be.    I tried to capture those lights, tried to hold them in my hands. I used my power of healing, broken bones were repaired and opened skin was closed. I sang, singing every song he liked. Why do they sound  sorrowful ? My head dropped onto his chest, hoping to hear that rhythmic, strong heartbeat.   Nothing.   My eyes felt weird, weird liquid filled in them. A tear, that is what he told me.  My tear dripped into those lights. They glowed. Stems and leaves grew out first, then a little purple bud attached, popping up. Last, it bloomed. I held it in my palms, blood dripping into the flower.    That purple with the red on the edge.    I stood up, putting the flower on his chest. Slowly, he sank into the ground, and surrounding him, purple flowers broke from the dirt and bloomed.      That day, I truly felt sadness. But then I lose it. Something overcomes the grief, hiding it away. My heart, if I had one, became heavier as he sank. The tear on my face vaporized by my heat. I know things would end like this at the beginning, what made me choose to ignore and pretend? I was never like this.   Maybe it is wrong at the beginning. Maybe I should not have noticed him that day. Maybe no mortal and god can last long. Maybe not the weak can be appreciated. Like Leto, he is just a sacrifice of jealousy, the price he pays for being a mortal. No need to be cried for.  Power is the only useful one in this world.    For sure, I have no heart, because it lies there, within that purple and red.   ";;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;0;1;1;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;semantic
56580688;;;;;Child;;;;;;Entity;;;;;;Drowning;;;;;"Trees that reached the sky surrounded me, snow slowly piling up on its branches. I followed the trunk down and saw the trail of sticks and leaves that laid sprawled across Gaea's floor. And finally, the blood that dripped from my chin and onto the ground. A strangely familiar person was lying in my lap. She looked older than me, with long glossy brown hair. She was as tan as I was too. We looked related almost.. When I grow up I want to look like her.  Every breath she took sent a puff of smoke in the air. I noticed there was a large amount of blood soaking her shirt. Trembling, I lifted it up carefully and found a nasty gash on her abdomen as well as claw marks over her heart. I looked around once more, seeing if there was anything I could use to help with her wounds. Something I can use to stop the bleeding at least. It seemed as if every second I wasted made the body become heavier and heavier. Her eyebrows were scrunched together. It seemed like she was dreaming. Grabbing a handful of random leaves (the ones still intact at least), I pressed it against her stomach and closed my eyes. I had no clue as to what I was doing. The only thing replaying in my head was a desperate wish for her to get better, for her wounds to heal. I prayed for her to get better, for her to wake up okay.  Almost instantly, her breathing began to change, it went from slow and labored breaths to deep and peaceful ones. I opened my eyes to find two curious brown ones staring back. Carefully, I removed the leaves from her stomach to find no wound painted on it. How is this even possible? Was it me? Looking at her, I asked, ""Are you okay?"" Finding my voice to be hoarse. She looked at me, confused, as if wondering the same things I was. Who she was and what we were doing in the middle of a forest. ""I don't know either,"" I said quietly, reading her expression. The girl got off my lap and sat up. She started to cough, concern filled my eyes. ""Is there anything to drink?"" She croaked out. I shook my head, closing my eyes. I imagined waterfalls, rivers, lakes...  I opened my eyes, looking back at her. Normally I would say I feel comfortable because we're both girls but I felt that there was something deeper... That we're tethered to each other somehow; Broken out of my trance I noticed a river in the distance behind her. I smiled, ""There! It's a river,"" She looked behind to where I pointed. I can't believe it hasn't frozen over yet! We both got up and rushed as fast as we could. My head felt like it was spinning as we ran but once I dipped my feet into the water I felt better. All of a sudden, my vision got clearer. The faint headache I felt coming on, disappeared. And my body felt stronger. I sat down, getting myself more comfortable in the water and played with the pebbles at the bottom. The different textures and patterns of their colors made them so alluring. I turned around to find the girl staring at the water strangely. She seemed almost afraid. How could anyone be afraid of this? Although it was freezing cold, it soothed me. Being in here felt like a breath of fresh air. I would have called her dumb if I hadn't gotten pulled in from behind.  My vision quickly grew dark and foggy as I sank deeper. The water stung my eyes as I slashed around, trying to get away from whatever was pulling me down. My hair was all over my face blocking my view, and the cold water that once felt comfortable started paralyzing my body. I wasn't sure what to do. Whatever was attacking me seemed almost invisible... but strong. Its presence reminded me of something inhuman... like a god. But why would a god harm me? Aren't they supposed to be good? Where's the surface? It's so dark now, have I been here for a while? Is the girl alright? She's alone. I have to get to her, ""Focus on yourself, you're the one in danger not her,"" A feminine voice said in my mind. She was quickly drowned out by more thoughts. Scrambling, I grabbed one of the biggest rocks I could find and swung it around me. It collided against whatever held me and I swiftly swam back up to the surface. Air finally filled my lungs and I wiped my eyes. I glanced around me, trying to find where I was. Then I saw her, she had passed out once again. Her eyebrows scrunched together as if she was having another bad dream. I crawled towards her, my body now sore from all the fighting in the water. My vision was blurred, and my head was ringing. Coughing harshly, I finally reached her. In an attempt to comfort her, I held her in my arms and gently swayed her like she was a baby. Doing so also comforted me, it reminded me of my mom, where is she...? Then I heard a twig snap behind me.  I looked around. Goosebumps, not only from the harsh wind, but from the feeling of being watched, appeared on my arms. Another pair of twigs snapped and I turned around to find a terrifying bear. The first thing I registered was its size. It was ten times bigger than I was. And I know I'm small but this bear was definitely abnormal. Something in my gut felt off as I noticed its eye, which was halfway from being gouged out. There was blood that was still drying trailing down its nose. It was unnerving. Their sharp pointed claws had blood on them too, I instantly thought back to the claw marks that were on the girl's chest. Realization had set in. Quickly, I scrambled away, pulling her body with me. The bear inched towards us slowly, almost like it was waiting to pounce at us. I looked around for a place to hide, to fight with, anything. Then I remembered the river that was near us. Maybe the thing that attacked me would go for the bear also. I pointed behind the bear and yelled ""Look over there!"" The bear turned away. Hastily, I dragged the girl's body behind bushes just outside of the riverbank and sprinted towards the water. The bear's head snapped back towards me instantly. Roaring at me, I yelled back,""Come at me! Are you scared or something?"" With no clue as to what I was doing, the only thing in my mind was how I needed the bear to follow me into the water. Maybe if I caught a fish and dangled it in front of it? But that wouldn't even work, the bear was looking at me like I was its new treat. The bear kept creeping closer and closer. And I stepped backwards deeper into the water in response. I ended up slipping on a loose rock and fell backwards on my butt. At this, the bear jumped at me, splashing the water in my face and scowling at me. Its fishy breath was in front of my face and smelled disgusting.  At the same time, something else pulled my hair and dragged me back into the water. A voice rang inside my head, ""Child, you must learn to put yourself first, now you will suffer,"" One moment I was about to get gnawed apart, now I was about to drown by some entity. Kicking strongly, I tried to get myself back up and away from the bear. My desperate attempts to pull back my hair from whatever it was caught on wasn't doing well... And as I saw the bear start clawing through the water, I knew I wasn't going to get out of here alive. I searched for a rock nearby to see if I could do what I did before but found nothing. The entity then latched itself onto my leg. Leaving nasty marks. Blood rapidly mixed with the water's color. I felt so sick. With the pain and the lack of air I couldn't think straight. I couldn't tell if the bear was even there anymore either.  I thought I was being smart but instead I dove into my own death. My life started to flash before my eyes. I saw a little girl, she looked happy, and she always had a bright smile on her face. The little girl then started to grow up. She celebrated her 12th birthday with her family... Had her first date with the cutest boy she ever met when she was 15... And then when she graduated she partied all night with her friends. She got her first job at her family's company. And from then on it got worse. She seemed tired all the time because of all the late nights. And her body looked as if she was skipping all her meals. In these flashes, I saw others as well. They seemed important considering the amount of times they surrounded her throughout her life. One of them was this woman. She didn't seem that tall but by how the girl always reacted, I assumed there was more to her than her appearance. She seemed animalistic, how she treated the girl compared to others. And the lazy eye she had looked disturbing, considering she had only half of it. It reminded me of the bear that was attacking me. As more memories flashed by, she began turning more and more sinister, like a monster.  Then I finally woke up. I stared up at the orange sky, noticing the giant snow covered trees once again. Immediately sitting up, I looked down at my body, to see how my leg looked. But I found nothing. Something feels off.. Where's the bear? My eyes then caught sight of the river. And the small child floating in the middle of it. My heart stopped, I scrambled out of the bushes and ran towards her. Once I finally reached her I pulled her towards me. I brushed the hair out of her face. Her brown eyes stared up towards the sky, lifeless. Her rosy cheeks now had no color to them, and her lips were stained blue. She looked like me, we look the same age too. That was when I realized..  She was me. I looked down at her leg, and was disgusted by the view of its large bleeding wound. Did I die? Am I all grown up now...? This is so confusing, who's body am I in? Is this my fault? Tears streamed down my face. Through my blurry vision I looked more at my own body, noticing how much bigger I was. I thought about the memories I had seen... and finally understood. She was my inner child. She tried to protect me. And now that she's gone I'm nothing but a dull adult. I should have protected her instead. Now her death is on my hands. I feel so empty, like I'm missing a part of myself. Crying, I closed her... my eyelids and folded her hands in the middle of her chest. The current of the river took her body away as soon as I nudged it out. Then I heard the feminine voice again, ""You have been warned, child. You must act now,"" Abruptly, I woke up. Everything was in my head... but the pain in my heart is still fresh. Finally, I figured it out, this entity was showing me what would happen if I don't start living for myself.     But... what entity?";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
57165361;;;;;man;;;;;;monster;;;;;;torn to pieces;;;;;"    Eurylochus led a handful of men to the edge of the ship, signaling them to dive in just as a wave crashes against the wooden ship. The threadbare shirt he wore did nothing to protect him from the freezing water, but that was the least of his worries.        He quickly took count of the men and began swimming to the front of the ship, trusting the others to follow. He took in a deep breath, forcing his heart to slow down, and went underwater, following the faint glow in the distance. His eyes stung, but blinking in the salty water didn't help.        He pushed through the current till he came face to face with the source of the glow; a woman-like creature, with canines too long to be human and scaled green twin-tails that flapped in the water.    He watched the furious expression at being confronted transform into a more familiar face,  Polites? , before he had his arms wrapped around the neck of the creature. Spines erupted along the tail, the siren thrashed, but he held steadfast, couting away the seconds till the figure stilled. He pushed upwards and thankfully gulped in the night air.        He waited a few sseconds, and the others too emerged from the water. He brought up the rear as they crowded near the ladder, waiting for Odysseus' next command. He could barely tell what was happening above deck, but through the broken reflections in the water, he pieced together the image of his queen, Penelope.        He drank in the sight of his best friends' wife for a few serene moments, memories of their family and him and Polites from before the war flooding his mind before the shadow of a man waved from the top of a ship. Eurylochus drew the knife, steeled his guts and dived once more. He focused on those sweet, sweet memories of his family as he cut the tails of the unconcious sirens floating near the ship.             Half an hour later, he stood on the deck, still shivering slightly as he removed the beeswax from his ears. Odysseus was stoicly staring out into the night sky, melodramatic ass that he was.        ""So?"" Eurylochus asked the obvious.       ""The lair of Scylla. That's how we get out of Poseidon's grasp.""       And just like that, all previous humour vanished. ""So, we do the impossible. Just another day then?""        Odysseus looked apologetic, but still nodded, unwavering in his decision. They stayed silent after that till the sky lightened ever-so-slightly to allow Eurylochus to make out Odysseus' thoughtful frown.          ""You're quiet today.""       ""Not much to say."" His voice was gravelly, tired, but then again, whose wasn't? Eurylochus did not inquire further.          The silence grew, but Eurylochus could feel it growing closer, stifling him till he breathed out through his mouth and spoke up, ""I've got a secret I can no longer keep.""        The guilt, of not just lies, but of all the blood on his hands, was squeezing, choking him. Odysseus barely looked at him, but his slightly tense body told him he was listening.           ""I opened the wind bag while you were asleep."" There. Those simple words for betrayal of trust of his closest friend.        Odysseus just shook his head. ""Why?""          Anger would have been better. Anger would have been appreciated. Eurylochus knew anger. He knew the blinding rage and hurtful words and stabbing pain and he knew to relish the soft, sharp hurt it brought with it. But dissapointment? The twisting in his heart it caused was worse.          ""I'm so sorry."" Eurylochus whispered. ""Forgive me."" And Odysseus nodded and that was that.        Eurylochus did not want to start to decipher the dark look in Odysseus' eyes, the strange hunger present alongside the familiar guilt of leading your own men to death. They sat silent once more, and Eurylochus felt the rising tension as though he was waiting for his verdict.        Odysseus finally simply walked away, ordering Eurylochus in a cold voice, ""Eurylochus, light up six torches."" He did as he was told, eyeing the way the flame raced up the liquid-doused wood and flickered violently. He handed them out to his own men, relishing the little warmth it provided.           The ship sailed on, and men came up and down the deck as guard duty shifts changed. Eurylochus lingered by the edge of the ship, eyeing the horizon once more.        ""Captain. Somethign approaches."" A darkness that had nothing to do with the night towered in the distance, and Eurylochus' heartbeat sped up once more.  Its just another battle , he thought to himself, gripping the leather-wrapped hilt of his sword till tiny crescent-shaped nail marks were permanently carved into it.  He met the eyes of his men around him, those holding the torches as well as those behind them.          ""Hello."" The deep growl had Eurylochus' stomach curling, some ancient part of him telling him to run, to flee, to save himself. He stood his ground as the monster wailed, the voice echoing around the cave and giving the illusion of multiple beings.        ""Row."" Odysseus shouted, eyes widening in fright. ""Row for your lives.""        Eurylochus repeated the words to those at the oars, and that shook then out of their trance.        "" Drown in your sorrow and your fears. ""        The chill to Eurylochus' core had nothing to do with the wind. "" Choke on your blood and your tears .""        Eurylochus peered around the dark, both looking for and not wanting to find the speaker. "" Bleed till you've run out of years. ""        No one made a single noise as they rowed, everybody stiller than they had been in the wooden horse in Troy. "" We must do what it takes to survive .""        Eurylochus held his breath, Odysseus doing the same beside him. A sudden groan to their left was followed by the booming voice.        "" Give up your honour and faith. Live up your life as a wraith. Die in the blood where you bathe. ""           Eurylochus swallowed the sudden tide of guilt as the words hit his heart, but still, they seemed directed at Odysseus. He was looking into the darkness without fear, something even Eurylochus was reluctant to do.           Another groan in front of them, and Eurylochus ducked when something came out of the water and wrapped itself around the man to Eurylochus's right holding a flaming torch. The shrill scream pierced through the veil of darkness before the man was dragged underwater by that monstrous appendage.        Eurylochus stifled a shout of terror and instead huddled closer to the floor.        Demetrius, another one of his men, stood near him, holding the torch aloft. He bent and joined Eurylochus on the floor.        ""Extinguish it."" Eurylochus ordered in a harsh whisper. Demetrius smiled sadly. The torch flickered in the dry summer wind, shadows bouncing around Demetrius' face creating the illusion of a watery grin.       Eurylochus could see his steadfast eyes, though. The eyes of a man not afraid to die. ""I command it.""        Demetrius shrugged as well as he could while lying face down and holding up a torch. ""I'm sorry. We both knew this was long coming.""          ""No. Demetrius I get that- Andreas-""       Demetrius held his spare hand up. The shadows looming just out of reach of the torch seemed to grow closer. A dread that had permanently taken up home in his mind grew once more.        ""I may not see Andreas again, or Polites, but sacrificing myself for my crew, my king? Why, brother, that's the best kind pf death, isnt it?""           Eurylochus wanted to scream, to tell him to drop the torch in the water, to hold him down till he followed, but Demetrius got up, dusting himself off flippantly. Eurylochus could still see the slight tremble of his hands.        Before he could shout, could do anything, the stupid, brave man walked forward, steering well clear of the huddled groups of men. He waved the fire around, and the sudden focus of the monster on his person was palpable.       Demetrius turned and met Eurylochus' eyes one final time, apologetic, scared, but so obviously relieved too. With tears in his eyes and a grin on his face, Demetrius raised the torch high like a flag, closing his eyes, water trailing down his face, as Scylla dragged him to the depths of the ocean.           The rest of his men carry the damning torch seemed to realise the inevitability of the situation and, much to Eurylochus' horror, by silent agreement, another man followed Demetrius' lead, offering himself up as easy sacrifice.        Bile rose in Eurylochus' throat. His gut threatened to turn, and he swallowed his nausea, sobbing silently.        He met their eyes each time in the dark, his sense of duty preventing him from dishonoring his men by doing otherwise. His eyes blurred, but he steadfastly looked at them, returning their small salutes with his own.          After an eternity in the dreamlike terror, all the torches had been extinguished by water, and with it went all forms of light. Eurylochus was shaking. He huddled closer to himself, the overwhelming utter helplessness catching in his throat and joining the shame in his heart.  The swirling hurt and guilt expanded outwards and, as they emerged into the open night sky, sharpened into something red hot and ugly.        Odysseus was at his side as always. His stricken expression melted into a blank mask as his eyes slid to Eurylochus', but he knew what to look for this time, and saw this too was an act for his benefit.              The sky outside was a slowly lightening blue, the setting moon turning the world to grey. Slowly, the men uncurled and got up, and those who had taken cover under the deck cautiously emerging up top.        Odysseus offer him an arm up, and Eurylochus took it, probably gripping it too tight to be comfortable. He stared at the hollow eyes and tried to get the panic in his chest under control.        What happened to you , he thought, running his gaze over the other man, scared to see someone he didnt recognise if he looked too close. Out of the two, Eurylochus had always been the harsher one. The carrot, the stick and the brains and charm. Polites, himself and Odysseus. He barely knew who any of them were anymore.          Eurylochus balled his fists, digging his nails in flesh. ""Tell me you did not know that would happen.""        His voice mercifully did not tremble. Odysseus released his arm.        ""Say you didn't know how this would end."" He was avoiding his eyes, Eurylochus realised, and it was like a bucket of cold water was dumped on his heart.        ""Look me in the eyes,"" he pleaded. ""And tell me, Captain."" That dark gaze look turned to him, and Eurylochus felt spark that expanded into something big between them every second their eyes met. His breathing was quick, tear tracks drying on his face, but no fear, only the chorus composed of guilt and denial and his ever present anger.        ""That you did not just sacrifice six men."" His voice was a roar by the end. Odysseus calmly met hus eyes, but beyond his own reflection in the gleaming iris, he could see the crumbling walls and Odysseus desperately holding on to the same anger he was.        ""Use your wits and try and say I'm crazy and mad."" The one time he would not mind being proven wrong by Odysseus. He was pleading his oldest friend, his brother and king. Fresh tears burned his flesh and left him bare in their wake, something raw struck as Odysseus refused to look away, both sensing the approaching disaster but stared, transfixed by the cracking of bonds forged through time and war and disaster and loss. ""That this is all some trick the gods have sent.""           ""Tell me."" His voice broke. He continued despite the glass in his throat that cut him down from the inside with every word. ""That you did not miss home so painfully bad, that you gave up the lives of six of our friends."" Eurylochus spit out the words with disgust, not sure if it hurt more to blame himself or to blame his brother.          Every second Odysseus remained silent, another part of Eurylochus disintegrated into nothingness till only a bitter husk remained.        ""When we fought the cyclops, you were quick to hatch a plan. And when we fought Circe, even when I wanted to save ourselves, it was you who left behind no man. ""          ""But when we fought this monster,""  as if they'd actually raised arms against Scylla , ""We didn't take a stand."" He scoffed, trying to channel myriad of emotions through his words rather than his fists. ""You just ran.""  Like a coward , went unsaid. But not just a coward, no. He let their friends, the men who had followed his every word for ten years with full trust in his abilities to get them home, drop like flies to save his own life.        ""Say something."" He yelled, voice rough with emotion.          ""I can't."" Finally, the man snapped.          Eurylochus uncurled his hand and curled it again around his sword, a gift from Odysseus that he had used to defend his king for years, and cut off the final part of himself still clinging to his soul.        ""Then you have forced my hand.""          Ruthlessness is mercy upon our selves . The words floated up through the swirling fire that were his thoughts.        Fine, then . He settled into a fighting stance, feet apart and sword pointed at Odysseus' bare neck. He could see a vein visibly thump under his skin.           ""Lower your weapon."" The harsh words of someone who knew he would be listened to. Eurylochus went against every instinct screaming in his body.          ""No can do. You miss your wife so bad, youd trade the lives of your own crew.""          ""Dont make me fight you brother."" Odysseus frowned, but his hands still did not creep towards his own sword. ""You know you'd have done the same.""          ""If you want all the power, you must carry all the blame."" Eurylochus threw Odysseus' own words back, voice filled with venom.          Odysseus did not raise his sword even as Eurylochus drew closer. A wave of distaste filled Eurylochus at the arrogance, and he finally attacked, sword swiping through the air where Odysseus had been a moment ago. The sound of a sword being removed from a scabbard rang and Odysseus dodged and turned, arms raised defensively.       Eurylochus charged again, Odysseus parrying with relative ease. He pushed again and again, increasing the force behind each slash, his mind running through every trick in the book to find an opening. Odysseus did not allow him that, clashing swords till a bead of sweat dripped from his brow.           Their breaths puffed, but Eurylochus did not allow a moments respite, stabbing at his shoulder. Odysseus ducked and twirled, a leg hooking around Eurylochus'. He  twisted , and Eurylochus fell to his knees.        His heart missed a beat, but he recovered, tossing his own sword aside to wrestle the smaller man in the close quarters.        A punch landed on his face, blood gurgling down his mouth, and Eurylochus smirked, teeth covered in iron red. He snapped his head, meeting Odysseus' cheek bones with a satisfying crack. To his credit, Odysseus did not yell, instead just backed away and finally, finally began attacking with renewed vigour.           They traded blows back and forth, bloodlust in both their veins. Eurylochus grew desperate, his muscles cramping from the sudden activity. This man had built and torn down his entire life. He was at the centre of each moment in Eurylochus' existence, and it was only now that he saw who they truly were.  Monsters .          He took a gamble, faking an attack to his shoulder. Odysseus' was quicker, running on pure adrenaline, and a well aimed blow had Eurylochus doubling over. The next second, a cool metal pressed against his throat, hard enough to sting but not to draw blood.           ""I am not letting you get in my way."" Odysseus said, drawing a line of red on his neck, and Eurylochus noticed Odysseus' eyes. Wild. Desperate. A dog squaring against a bear, losing all semblance of humanity till only the desire to survive remained. Eurylochus swallowed, throat bobbing against his sword.           Odysseus was leaning over him, close enough for Eurylochus to smell the sharp sting of sweat and blood, the familiar scent of war. His eyes were hidden in shadow, a small cut on his cheekbone streaked red. He nodded his head ever so slightly as the sharp edge pressed harder, preventing him from breathing.        Blood sprayed over Eurylochus first. Odysseus staggered backwards, eyes wide as his hands came bloody from his stomach. He looked at Eurylochus in horror, then behind him, at Gregory, one of Eurylochus' men, holding a knife dripping with his own blood.        ""My brothers."" He croaked, before collapsing to his knees with a dull thud. ""Why?"" The haunted voice whispered before Eurylochus quickly knocked his sword hilt against his Odysseus' temple.        His eyes closed, face relaxing, making him look much younger. Eurylochus stood, one arm holding his sword, and met Gregory's eyes.        ""Tie him up. We sail to the nearest land."" The crew seemed uneasy, but no one argued.                    Odysseus came to with a groan. He tried to shield his eyes from the blinding light, sunsequently realising his hands were tied. He slowly opened his eyes, blinking rapidly till they adjusted to the midday sun. A dark shadow sat at his side, and Odysseus greeted his closest friend with a nod, regretting the decision a moment later. He groaned at a stab of pain. ""My head.""       Eurylochus merely stared at him, eyebrows furrowed but eyes cold. ""Where are we?"" He asked, looking around intrestedly at the picture perfect scenery. Blue skies, lush green grounds. A rocky beach and dense forest. A few men sat around in groups, looking out of place with their worn and dirt-covered clothes and weapons in the beautiful landscape. He thought he heard the mooing of a cow somewhere, but craning his neck to find it was also a bad idea. A much sharper pain pierced his side. A stab wound, hurting like hell but dressed in clean bandages. Eurylochus' work, if he had to guess.           ""Some island."" Eurylochus replied, a distraction from the pain Odysseus readily accepted. ""The first one we could find.""    ""It's bursting with cows."" Eurylochus added, frowning. A little redundantly, if you asked Odysseus. He could hear the mooing just as well. A cow strolled into view, and Odysseus raised his eyebrows appreciatively at the giant animal with soft eyes and shining white fur, before noticing the hungry look in Eurylochus' eyes as he considered the cattle before him.        Odysseus' stomach growled as if on cue, though maybe that was just his insides trying to recover from the being stabbed. ""They are just roaming about. There are no people here. There's just so much meat.""           Odysseus' stomach was empty, hadn't been completely filled in months, but their encounter with the lotus-eaters had taught him better.        ""Eurylochus."" He said urgently. ""Don't. You know there is no way this ends well. We- our men could be die."" Eurylochus snorted, and Odysseus had to admit the derision was well deserved.        ""Look, I'm sorry. But there was no other way.""           Eurylochus ignored his apology. ""There is no other food here either, nor is there anything in the ocean. We have nothing left. And hunger is so heavy.""        Odysseus' heart softened at seeing Eurylochus in pain for a moment, before his head thrummed, reminding him how he had been knocked out. The haze in his mind prevented any clear thoughts.           Eurylochus looked at him, shoulders drooping, before noticing something on his face and joining him on the grassy ground.        ""You're bleeding."" He said, pouring what was possibly the last bit of alcohol still remaining on his head wound. Odysseus hissed but did not move as Eurylochus wrapped a bandage around his head. He sat heavily beside Odysseus, leaning against the tree. He could maybe reach a knife on Eurylochus' belt, cut himself out, but his warning glare had Odysseus settling once more. He had no crew, no food. Not even a fully functioning body. Couldn't do much at the moment.       Eurylochus' gaze returned to the cows milling about, and Odysseus could see him fantasizing eating them.        ""There's really no one here?"" Odysseus asked; his turn to distract Eurylochus from doing something they would regret. Eurylochus regarded him for a moment.        ""Just a statue of the lord of the sun."" He answered. ""Don't nt know where its from, but the cows seem attracted to it.""          A warning bell sounded in Odysseus' brain, some legend about Apollo and cows that Athena had told him on a lazy afternoon as they relaxed after a lesson in his youth, but he could not, for the life of him, maybe literally, remember the foggy memories through his haze. He silently cursed Eurylochus.          Eurylochus got up suddenly, grabbing his sword and decidedly unsheathing it. ""Eurylochus, wait.""       The larger man stilled. ""Please don't ont tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do."" Odysseus said softly. Eurylochus turned to face him, and Odysseus could have sobbed at the look of pure devastation on his brother's face.        ""Ody, we're never going to get to make it home, you know it's true.""           A piece of Odysseus' heart shattered. The defeat in Eurylochus' voice had his gut twisting.        ""You don't know that's true."" Eurylochus hunched further, but made no move to leave. ""This is the home of the sun god."" He tried to argue.          ""I'm starving my friend."" Eurylochus said it so matter-of-factly, his voice devoid of any previous anger, that Odysseus flinched.        ""If you kill his cattle, who knows what he'll send."" He stated quietly.        Eurylochus' dark eyes met his own. ""I'm tired, my friend.""        ""But we're so close to home."" Odysseus pleaded, softly tugging against the ropes binding him. ""This can't be where it ends.""        ""You see a light at the end of the tunnel, Odysseus. I don't. No matter what, i am not getting Polites, my men, back."" Odysseus swallowed roughly.        ""How much longer must we suffer now?"" Eurylochus asked rhetorically, and Odysseus wished he had an answer.        ""Please don't do this."" All he could do was beg.        ""How much longer should we push through doubt?""        ""I need to get home, Eurylochus.""        ""How much longer should I go about my life like this?""        ""Eurylochus.""        ""When people die like this?""        ""We can get you home.""        ""I have no home left. Not anymore.""        ""Eurylochus. I'm sorry.""        ""I'm just a man."" Eurylochus said, and got up once again. The set in his shoulders was definite as he stalked towards his prey, and Odysseus tugged harder at his bonds.           The sun shining on Odysseus' face left him able to only see the dark silhouettes. Eurylochus' sword raised, and Odysseus shouted, ""Eurylochus, no!"", just as he brought it down with a powerful swing.           The red blood arced through the air, gleaming like stained glass against the sun midair, before splattering against the ground. The world hung silent for a few moments.       Odysseus whispered in horror, throat parched, ""You've doomed us.""           Eurylochus looked back up at him. ""You've doomed us all, Eurylochus."" He yelled, fury bursting forth like water through a dam.        What had he done?  I have to get back. To Penelope, to Telemachus.  Odysseus thought distantly, and that single thought propelled him. He tugged desperately against the ropes holding him back, ignoring the pain it brought, and with a final crack, they snapped.           ""Captain?"" Eurylochus reproachfully asked, lowering his sword.          ""We need to get away from this island."" Odysseus yelled. Crashing noises came from deep within the forest, a deep groan as the earth below their feet shifted. ""Now.""           The cows ran about, panicking, but by some miracle the men avoided getting hit as everyone ran to the ship as fast as legs allowed.           ""Grab an oar with all the strength your arms allow."" Odysseus reached the top of the ladder and hit the ground rolling. He clambered to his feet, approaching Eurylochus.           ""These cows were immortal."" He snapped. Eurylochus watched him with wide eyes. ""They were the sun god's friend.""        The anchor was pulled up, and ship slowly got off the beach as the final line of trees crashed into the ground with a resounding crack. ""And now that we've pissed them off,"" Odysseus snarled, staring up into Eurylochus' horror-drawn face and shouting, ""Who do you think they'll send?""        Eurylochus took a step back. ""Full speed ahead."" He yelled, officially wrestling back control of his men from Eurylochus' short reign.        Odysseus' heart hammered in his chest, anticipation and adrenaline twisting and overriding all feelings. ""Faster"" he yelled, looking behind them for any signs of a threat. The sky around them darkened. ""Faster."" The waves were beating against the side of the ship. Wind howled, and the smell of ozone reached Odysseus first. Thunder crashed, lightning blinding him for a moment before he realised there was someone standing in front of them.        ""We're too late."" He whispered, the throbbing of his brain loud in his ears, or maybe that was his heartbeat. One moment passed, the world remained frozen, and the next, all his men were standing behind the lord of the skies.             Odysseus dropped to his knees, kneeling as he set his sights on the king of the gods' corpeal form for the first time. He still had nightmares about the rumbling voice from the last time they had met. He could not stop the building dread in his gut.        Zeus smirked at him, cruel eyes glinting. He held a lightning bolt in his hands, and Odysseus shivered under the mere presence of the weapon used to slay titans.        ""Pride is a damsel in distress."" Began the king of gods. His voice like the rolling of thunder, the god miracled himself a huge, golden throne in the middle of the ship and settled into it, legs spread under the royal purple toga. Odysseus stood frozen, not daring to look away from the god in front of him. If it was any other time, Odysseus might have been in awe. As it was, he did his best to not move, lest he attract the famed wrath of Zeus. ""Hiding away where only I can undress her.""           The king cupped one hand around something in the air, and an ornate, silver goblet shimmered into existence. ""Try all she can not to confess. In the end, its all the same once I apply all the pressure.""           Odysseus mused distantly why Zeus was telling him this. Was it a lesson, or a comparison. Was he being too prideful? He wondered.           Zeus looked away from his drink, apparently finished with the speech, and raised a surprised eyebrow at Odysseus still kneeling on the ground. ""Get up."" He vaguly waved his ring adorned hand. Odysseus stood, knees creaking.           ""Tell me, Odysseus."" Zeus rumbled. Odysseus would not have been surprised if his heart had stopped in that moment. ""If I were to make you chose; the lives of your men and crew, or your own. Why do I think they'll lose?""          Zeus took a sip of the golden liquid with a satisfied sigh, before tipping the goblet in Odysseus' direction. ""Enlighten me, king of Ithaca. Since hunger was far too great, I wonder who'd take the weight of the damned and suffer a gruesome fate.""        ""You made a grievious error, son of Laeretes. You insulted the gods, my son, no less, and expected your act of crime to go unpunished?"" He asked, bushy eyebrows frowning incredulously.       ""Choose.""          ""Choose?"" Odysseus breathed out, voice shaky and tight with emotion.          ""Someone has to die today. You, or your crew? You have the final say, king of Ithaca.""          The king looked back at him, deep blue eyes filled with dark amusement. ""So, choose."" A slight smirk twisting his lips, Zeus gulped the rest of his nectar and sat back, eyes hooded dark with power.           ""Please, don't make me do this."" He begged, tears in his eyes. The same words he had uttered when given the choice to kill Hector's son or to never see his family. The first time, it had been his family or the child.     Now, it was him or his men.  I can't let them die,  he thought desperately.          Zeus said nothing, simply lounging on his chair, fingers trailing along the body of the lightning bolt. An immortal, all-powerful deity, forcing Odysseus to make impossible choices, for what? Entertainment? Some twisted feeling of power? Odysseus pushed the thoughts out of his racing mind.          Choose? He could choose to save his own hide, to return to his dearest Penelope, to his sweet Telenachus, to go home and be happy? Or he could choose his men. The thirty six men who he had sworn to protect. Men who had given their everything to him for over twelve years, who were his citizens and his army and his family.           In the end, there was only one option.             Eurylochus' voice pierced through the darl veil of thoughts. ""Captain?""       ""I have to see her, Eurylochus."" Odysseus begged him to understand. He wondered if the other man was thinking about the conversation between them and Polites after the first time he met zeus. How overcome by guilt he had been, how close to the tipping off the ledge.  Now, look at the pair of them , he thought darkly.  Killers. Traitors.          ""But we'll die."" The quiet whisper would haunt him for the rest of his life. Odysseus looked away, not wanting to see the tears on his mens' face.        Eurylochus stubbornly stared at him, pulled his into the swirling darkness of his tearful eyes, and a thousand unsaid words passed between them in that instant.        ""I know."" He said, shaking with silent sobs.  I know you'll die. I know you're sorry. I know I'm a monster.  Tears refused to stop flowing down his face.          Odysseus was falling, and for the first time, he didn't know what to do. His heart twisted, guilt crashing down upon him in waves that had him shivering. He dug his fingers into arm, hard enough to provide momentarily relief, before a new wave of pain washed over him as he looked over the men who had followed him to literal hell. Tired eyes, broken figures. Not a single dry eye.  I'm sorry.  Empty words that would change nothing.          Zeus, seeming unaware of Odysseus' inner bdnd, sat up on his chair.        ""Well, this has been fun."" He rose to his full glory, using the lightning bolt as a cane as he got to his feet, robes swishing under some unseen wind. ""I wish you luck, king of Ithaca. You will need it. Until next time.""           The king of the gods waved his hand, and the world disappeared around Odysseus. ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
56417806;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"It is late afternoon, early summer. I stand by the cliff overlooking the harbour of Knossos, where a large flotilla of fishing boats and ships have assembled. The priestesses sing hymns; offerings are made. At last, I raise my hands to bless the fishermen down below us, their boats and nets, ensuring that they will have plentiful catches of fish.  ""All hail the living Goddess of Kaphtor,"" they gratefully shout up to me. The rites have gone well. I am pleased.  The priestesses and I walk the short distance back to the palace, the House of the Double Axe.  ""Will you be taking your evening meal in the caves again this evening, my Goddess?"" a maidservant asks. I nod. We do not speak of the reason I go down there, to be with my son. But she understands.  As I begin descending the stairs toward the cave entrance, deep underneath the palace, the weariness of the day departs from me. My heart beats with joyful anticipation. My woman-flower moistens.  * * *  I am the living Goddess. I am Pasiphae.  I am Goddess and Queen: my word is law on this blessed island of Kaphtor; no one may gainsay my wishes.  I am Goddess and Queen, yet I must hide from my people the thing that most gives me joy. As though it were a thing of shame. I refuse to be ashamed: I love my son. Though he be called a monster. Though my love for him is not the chaste love of a normal mother.  I am not normal. I am the living Goddess. I am Pasiphae. My divine body burns with sacred desire for him, for my Asterion. Though he be called a monster by the people of Kaphtor, though he must be kept hidden away, imprisoned in the caves beneath this House of the Double Axe. To me he is perfect. He is beautiful. He is my delight.  He is my delight, from his strong bull face, with his sad, tender eyes, down to his mighty hooves, that stamp the ground impatiently as I approach his chambers. (He can smell me coming, even before I enter the caves.) Yes, his head and legs are those of a bull; but his chest, arms and buttocks are like a man, though covered in short, coarse bronze-coloured fur, flecked with patches of ivory. I love to run my fingers through his fur, feeling the powerful muscles rippling under his skin, as he pounds into me. Yes, there is one other part of him that is magnificently bull-like. No woman but I can fully ensheathe him, down to his testicles. No phallus but his can satisfy me. We were made for each other. Or rather, I made him for myself.  * * *  What divine inspiration was it that led me to lie with his father, that magnificent White Bull of Knossos? How did I know that my womb could accommodate him, when no other woman's could?  I was then in the first flower of womanhood. It was just a year after my mother, the old Queen died, and the spirit of the Goddess passed to me. In the preceding years, my chubby girlish body had blossomed. Between my legs, a thick carpet of silky black hair had appeared, from my navel back to the furrow between my buttocks. My hips and thighs flared out wide and full; my breasts grew heavy, my belly was soft and plump. I was ready for marriage. My counsellors advised me to take Minos, son of the Cypriot Queen, as my consort: it would establish friendly relations between our two islands, they said. I followed their counsel. But Minos could not satisfy me, and his seed was thin as water, with a foul smell: it had no life in it. He gave my womb no joy, and no child grew in it. After a few months of this, I ceased to lie with him. I could give myself more pleasure with my own fingers. I could adopt some suitable girl to be my daughter, to succeed me as Goddess. Minos has remained king; I saw no reason to humiliate him and offend Cyprus, by deposing him. Since those days, we have not spoken much to each other.  On Midsummer Day of that same year, I walked out into the fields with the priestesses, to bless the herds and flocks with our dancing. The White Bull stood out from the other cattle as the full moon stands out from the stars. The priestesses all noticed him; they commented on what a splendid bull he was. But I -- I could not take my eyes off him. I returned the following day, alone, to watch him: something drew me.  Then I saw him mounting the cows. I saw that glorious phallus emerge from his shaggy underbelly. The sight of it inflamed me, so that I could think of little else. How fiercely I envied those cows! Nectar dripped down between my thighs. The White Bull sniffed the air, then looked directly at me. As though he could see into my soul.  I returned again the next day, late in the afternoon. He allowed me to approach him; he seemed curious, almost amused by my presence. I offered him some figs from my hand, and he ate them, his thick tongue licking my palm. He let me caress his brow, his horns, his muzzle, his powerful neck and shoulders. His gentleness moved me; his beauty and power aroused me. He sniffed the air again, lowering his head, bringing his nose near to my lap.  It was now after dusk: the herdsmen had all gone home. I removed my skirts, wondering how he would respond. To my delight, the Bull immediately shoved his muzzle between my thick thighs - snuffling with his hot breath, nuzzling at my shaggy pubic nest, licking over my engorged woman-flower, lapping up my abundant nectar there.  There was a large boulder nearby, shaded by a myrtle tree. I bent over the boulder, offering the Bull my body, presenting my fat rump to him the way the cows do. Again, he shoved his muzzle into my furrow, licking over my anus, over the petals of my woman-flower, with his thick hot tongue. He pressed the tongue-tip between them, deep into my sheath. But I was greedy for something even bigger and harder.  ""Please ... mount me!"" I begged.  Did the Bull understand my plea, or was he about to do it anyway? I will never know. He reared up, placing his fore-hooves on the stone above my shoulders. And then, delirious with joy, I felt that enormous, thick phallus slide into my woman-sheath, filling me up, knocking the air out of my lungs. I had been close to orgasm from the Bull's licking, but now I immediately came. And I kept coming as the Bull drove deep into me over and over again, splitting me open, repeatedly punching my cervix with the head of his phallus. Had I been a slenderer woman, his pounding might have shattered my pelvis. But my hips and belly were amply cushioned, well able to absorb his thrusts. At last the Bull gave a great bellow, shuddering. I felt his phallus twitching deep inside me, as he flooded my womb with his hot, potent seed.  He withdrew, and the thick seed poured out of me, splattering on the boulder beneath me, puddling on the ground. He nuzzled my shoulder and licked the nape of my neck, licked at my armpits, a gesture of deep tenderness. I sat up, turning towards him. I kissed his muzzle.  ""Thank you,"" I wept gratefully. He snuffled, as though returning my thanks. I hugged his warm neck. At last, I refastened my skirts and hobbled back to the palace, buoyed up on a cloud of euphoria, my inner thighs coated with his sticky seed.  I was so sore the next morning, I could scarcely walk; but the soreness was delicious to me, reminding me of my sweet tryst with the Bull the night before. I bathed for several hours in asses' milk, and by late afternoon I was mostly recovered. As dusk fell, I went out to the fields, to meet my Bull again.  This went on for many days. Rumours reached my ears, that some herdsmen had seen us. But I took no notice. I am the living Goddess. I am Pasiphae. I need not blush at rumours.  * * *  One evening I went out to the field, but he was not there. Discretely, I asked my maidservant Rhea about the White Bull. Word came back that King Minos had offered him in sacrifice. I quaked with rage and crumpled in despair, but I could say nothing. For the king to sacrifice such a magnificent animal, so everyone thought, was an act of great piety; his behaviour could not be faulted. Not without publicly confirming the rumours.  For over a month, I shut myself away in my chamber, drowning in grief. I became ill with it, my belly began to swell with it, or so I thought. My maidservants grew alarmed.  But the High Priestess examined me and shook her head. ""It is not grief that makes your belly grow, my Goddess. You are with child.""  As the months passed, my belly swelled up till the skin was tight as a drum. My maidservants constantly rubbed olive oil into it, to keep the skin supple, fearful that I would burst open. Never had they seen such a heavy pregnancy, they swore. Toward the end, I could not walk without their assistance.  Meanwhile, everyone congratulated Minos on getting me with child. He said nothing to disconfirm his fatherhood, nor did any of the palace servants, though they knew very well that it had been nearly a year since Minos had shared my bed.  The day came when my water broke, and the contractions started. No other woman could have done it, but my woman-sheath, that had allowed the White Bull of Knossos to impregnate me, now stretched to allow the birth of his son. The midwife recoiled in shock as she reached in to draw out the crowning head -- not a human head, she found, but that of a bull-calf. At last, he fully emerged, making high-pitched grunts rather than cries. The midwife cut the cord and laid him at my breasts. I was exhausted with the labour, but joyful to hold my child. Joyful as well that he bore some of the features of his true father. I fell in love, instantly, deeply, completely, with his sweet bull-face, his fur-covered but human-shaped body, his adorable little hooves.  ""Asterion. He shall be called Asterion,"" I panted.  ""But ... is it not for King Minos to name the child, my Goddess?"" asked Rhea, unsure how to react to this monstrous-miraculous birth.  I shook my head fiercely. If I conceded to Minos the power to name him, he could instead order the child to be thrown from the cliffs. Rhea was giving me a way out, thinking that I would want the ""monstrosity"" quietly disposed of, to put this sordid affair behind me. How little my maidservant knew me.  ""He is Asterion. I, Pasiphae, have spoken."" Like a she-bear protecting her cub, I hugged him tightly to my bosom.  Asterion's little bull-muzzle rooted for my nipple and latched on, drawing forth milk from my breast. A fog of drowsiness descended upon me. I fell asleep, grateful to be suckling my precious new-born son, comforted at last after the loss of my White Bull. I now had Asterion to live for.  * * *  Others were not so happy about Asterion's birth. No one spoke to me of him except in the most euphemistic and indirect of terms. I saw that my people were embarrassed by Asterion. Their lust-addled Goddess-Queen had lain with a beast of the field, obviously, and consequently given birth to a horrifying monster, half-man half-bull. What were they to think of that? I am their Goddess: they may not rebuke me; they may not question my behaviour. It was easier for them to pretend the whole thing never happened. As long as I kept Asterion from public view, their manner toward me was warm and respectful as before. But when I spoke with motherly pride about Asterion's childish accomplishments - learning to walk, to eat solid food, and so on -- I felt their cold disapproval.  I had never experienced this sort of treatment before, and it did not please me. I could have railed at them and threatened curses. My angry words might have made them fear me - and hate me. But I wanted their love, their reverence, which could never be won with harshness, I knew. I am their Goddess and their Queen, but that carries with it great responsibility as well as great power. They are my people, my worshippers, and I must take care for their well-being, just as I must take care of my precious son. I cannot run roughshod over their feelings.  And so, Asterion was kept away from public view. As he grew, my servants hinted that perhaps the best place for him was in the caves beneath the palace.  Indeed, he grew much more quickly than a human child. A bull matures in two years. Asterion did not grow quite that fast. But certainly by ten years of age, he was full-grown. To my sorrow, he never could learn to speak. Whether this was because his lips and tongue were not shaped for human speech, or because he could not think in human language, or some mixture of the two, I cannot say. Often he makes a sound, like ""hmmagh-hmmagh"". I think perhaps he is trying to say ""mama"". He seems to understand some of my words, or perhaps the gestures that accompany my words. But even without language, Asterion and I understand each other, perhaps more deeply than most humans do. There is a look of bright intelligence in his eyes. He knows how deeply I love him. Of this I am certain. Just as I know he returns my love.  He likes to spend his days making things: a chair, a goblet, things of wood or things of clay. There is skill in his fingers, and his wares are quite beautiful. I often give them as gifts to the priestesses and other officials. His creations are much sought-after in Knossos. I do not say who made them, but they know. Sometimes he makes fantastical figurines, with absurd faces that make me laugh. It pleases him, to make me laugh. It helps us forget that he is, by general agreement, imprisoned in these caves. There is no lock upon the entrance, but he knows he must not leave. His chambers are comfortable, of course. He is provided with all that he needs. The servants leave his meals by the entrance. He takes normal human food, neither the grass and straw that his father ate, nor the human flesh that some ignorant gossipers whisper about. I ordered shafts to be cut in the caves' roof, to allow in sunlight. There is a spring-fed pool in one of the chambers, in which he can bathe. A separate channel was cut to carry away his wastes. Sometimes after dark, we stroll together outside, so he can take in the fresh air. As long as we keep well away from other people, there are no repercussions.  My duties as Queen require me to spend some daytime hours away from my son. But I spend nearly every night with him. I cannot sleep, apart from him.  * * *  I know my son's body intimately. From his infancy onward, it was I who bathed and dressed him. From month to month, from year to year, I saw him grow to manhood - if that be the right word. I saw him shoot up, to a stature much taller than me, taller than most men. He put on muscle. His strength is prodigious. I would love to see him pit his strength against the men of Kaphtor in the sacred games: I am certain he would win them all. But alas, for him to move about openly among the people of this land -- that is a wish I will never see fulfilled.  I am the living Goddess. To whom can I pray, to whom can I turn with the deepest supplications of my heart? I can pray to my divine Self, but that brings me no consolation. Instead, I pray to him. I worship him. Asterion is my God.  From his brow, horns grew, that remind me keenly of his father, the White Bull. And I saw the boyish waterspout between his legs grow into a magnificent bull-like phallus, another potent reminder of his father. Perhaps it is even a little bigger, I cannot be certain. In those all-too-brief times when the Bull and I were together, I was always so impatient to have him inside me, I never got a good close-up look at that instrument of my pleasure. With Asterion, however, I can examine and admire him to my heart's content. When erect, it is longer and thicker than my forearm, from my fingertips to beyond the elbow. I know: I have measured it.  He grew into adolescence. As I washed him, or as I hugged him or caressed him affectionately, as any mother may do with her son, his phallus would emerge from its hiding place, becoming fully erect. The first few times this happened, the look in his eyes was still that of a child, though his body seemed nearly full-grown. I patted his sweet phallus affectionately, then kissed his cheek, to let him know his erection was nothing to be alarmed or ashamed about. Gradually, the look in his eyes changed. It was replaced by a questioning look, unsure what to make of the strong new feelings arising in his heart and his body. Then a begging look, pleading with me to do something to relieve these feelings. In time, he would guide my hand down to his phallus, and I would pat it affectionately, as I had often done before. But now, he would put his hand over mine, holding it there. I would grasp his strong phallus with my fingers, though only partially: it is too thick for my fingers to fully encompass it. He would snuffle with happiness when I did this. Even more so when I stroked my hand up and down the shaft. It is one of the few parts of his body that is not covered with fur, and I love the feel of his bare skin there. A rivulet of seed often dribbled down from the tip.  By this time, the look in Asterion's eyes was no longer that of a child. There was desire there, such as I had seen in the White Bull's eyes. I could not behold that desire in his eyes without being deeply moved. In truth, the desire in his eyes, and the sight of his phallus, the bare-skin feel of it in my hand, the smell of his seed from its tip -- these all inflamed my passions. As with the White Bull, I soon could think of little else. Nectar welled up in my woman-flower, flowing out between my thighs, and he could smell it. He grunted, questioningly, longingly: ""hmmagh-hmmagh?""  When this happened, I would pull my hand away. I would sit a little further away from him, attempting to subdue my own growing desire. I tried to reassure him that I was not upset with him, that he had done nothing wrong. I caressed his brow and horns. I kissed his cheek. Strong as he is, he could easily have forced me to do what he wanted. But he always accepted whatever limits I set. His phenomenal strength is matched by his utter gentleness; this makes me love him all the more. The question was, could I abide by those limits myself?  * * *  One evening as we reclined together, instead of guiding my hand to his phallus, he dipped his head down and took my breast in his mouth. I had not suckled him in years, and it brought back a flood of sweet memories. I cradled my dear son's head in my arms, stroking his brow and horns as he continued to nurse, switching from one breast to the other, licking my hard nipples with his thick, hot tongue. There was no milk in them, nevertheless my heavy breasts seemed to comfort him. His mouth felt so good on them. Instinctively, I reached out and began stroking his phallus. He huffed with pleasure. Between my thighs, I was wet as Knossos harbour.  Yes, I thought, this is what my son needs. He is ready for it, and no other woman can give it to him. I too am ready - more than ready. Ever since the birth of my miraculous son, everything had been leading toward this blessed moment. I could fight it no longer; I did not want to fight it. I am crossing a line, I recognized, beyond the normal love of a mother for her son. But I am not normal. I am the living Goddess, I am Pasiphae.  I rose to my feet, watching his reaction, as I unclasped the girdle that held up my skirts. They dropped to the ground, and I stood naked before him. He had often seen me naked before: we frequently bathed together. But this, he knew, was different. Asterion looked at me in wonderment, his eyes bright with emotion.  That first time, I had to show him what to do. My son had never seen a bull mount a cow, nor a man lie with a woman. I motioned for him to lie back on the bed. I straddled him, guiding his daunting phallus between the petals of my flower. Then I slowly sank down on it. It took some determination - surely he is even larger than the White Bull! - but I was able to take all of him, down to his testicles. Back into the place he came from. He did not last long the first time. Neither did I.  Afterwards, we both wept for joy, holding each other, kissing each other, as I sucked his thick bull-tongue into my mouth. At length, I laid my head down on his powerful, furry chest, feeling the mighty heart beating within. Thank you Asterion, I fervently prayed to my God.  But just like a man, he promptly fell sound asleep.  * * *  Lying with Asterion is quite different from my times with his father. The White Bull did what he wanted with me, and I happily let him do it. With Asterion, there is an intimate back-and-forth. Show me mother, his eyes always seem to say.  That does not mean he is passive. He has learned that I love for him to mount me and ravish me like a cow in heat, just as the White Bull did. This he does very forcefully. He enjoys playing with my fat, wobbly buttocks as he pounds into me from behind, kneading them with his powerful hands. His father could not do this: he had no hands, only hooves.  My son loves kissing my buttocks, licking them, licking the deep hair-lined furrow between them, licking over my anus and my nether lips, sometimes for hours on end, making me come again and again, till I can take no more. Sometimes I gush fluids as he licks me, and I drench his face. I was embarrassed by this at first. But he seems to love it when this happens. He loves the taste of my nectar.  I love his taste too. Ever since he began having erections, I had longed to take him in my mouth. I could lick along the length of his shaft, I could suck on the very tip, as I stroked him with my hand. He seemed to love this. He squirmed and huffed with pleasure, then erupted, splattering his viscous white love-potion all over my face and neck. But how was I to take him inside my mouth? Initially, I could barely get the thick head past my lips. My jaw ached, trying to open wide enough. But he tasted delicious. I was determined: if my womb could accommodate him, so would my mouth.  In time, I learned to relax my lips, jaw and tongue, and I found I could take the whole head in. I feared I would not be able to breathe, but soon I realized I can breathe through my nose. As the head slid into the back of my throat, I felt a need to cough -- a sort of choking sensation. But I meditated on the sacred Snake who guards the House of the Double Axe: She swallows her prey whole, and I am She, I am the living Goddess. I learned to keep calmly breathing through my nose, relaxing my mouth and throat, swallowing him into my gullet. At last, I was able to take the full length of him, till his heavy, warm testicles rested on my chin.  Once we reach this point, I bob my head up and down, letting his phallus slide in and out, just a handbreadth or so. Invariably, this quickly leads to him coming, filling my stomach with his copious seed. It is a delightful way, I find, to conclude our love-making for the evening, before we drop off to sleep in each others arms. I love having this mighty man-beast under my spell, like putty in my hands - or rather, in my mouth. I love to have him whimpering, huffing, bellowing with gratitude at the pleasure I give him this way. It is one of the ways I worship my God.  * * *  I reach the end of the stairway. I can hear him stamping behind the door. I step through it and immediately he takes me in his arms, lifting me off my feet. He kisses me, open muzzle to open mouth, my little tongue duelling with his massive one, with a little more passion than usual.  ""That was a lovely greeting, my son. But you may put me down now.""  He pays me no heed, instead carrying me straight to bed and setting me down on it, pulling off his kilt and loincloth. He is fully erect already.  ""My, you certainly are eager this evening!"" I laugh. ""Will you not show me what you worked on today?"" That is usually how we start our evenings together.  But tonight, he seems to have other plans. He throws back my skirts, diving his head down between my thighs, lapping up the wetness he finds there, snuffling and huffing with excitement. I grip his horns, using them to steer his tongue towards my hard little nub, the centre of my pleasure.  ""Oh yes, right there. Oh my sweet sonnnnn! Right there. Ahhh, I'm ... cummmmnnnnnnnffff!!!"" I cry out, splashing his face with my nectar. But he does not let up. One of his thick fingers invades my anus. Immediately, I come again, wailing and thrashing about. Still he does not let up.  ""NO! Stop!"" I say severely, closing up my thighs. He backs off, afraid he has upset me.  ""Hmmagh-hmmagh?"" he grunts.  I stroke his muzzle and smile at him, to let him know I am not upset. ""If I let you,"" I shake my head at him, ""you will keep licking your mama all night long. But I want you inside me now. In my anus. I have been fondly remembering the last time we did it that way. And you seem so eager tonight: I want to give you something special.""  He understands nothing of my words, probably, or very little. I get up to find the butter dish, and hand it to him. His eyes go wide, and he snuffles with excitement. This he understands.  I pull off my skirts and bodice, kneeling at the edge of the bed, face down, assuming the cow position.  Asterion is now slathering butter on his phallus. I reach back to spread my buttocks apart. ""Me too,"" I remind him. He comes behind me and smears a generous dollop on my anus, then works it inside with his finger. I shiver with anticipation.  He pauses. I can tell exactly what he is thinking, the scamp: he is salivating at the sight of my buttery anus; he wants to lick it all out, slowly, and then start over again. I am tempted to go along with this. But my impatience for his phallus wins out.  ""Uh-uh-uh,"" I chide. ""I want you inside me."" He sighs.  A moment later, his fingers dig into my buttocks, spreading them wide. I feel the hot head of his phallus against my exposed anus. Slowly it presses its way through my sphincter. I whimper at the strange pleasure of it, tinged with pain.  ""Wait,"" I hiss. He obeys. I need a moment to adjust, to let my sphincter relax and ready myself for the pounding I am about to receive. I breathe slowly. I feel melting butter trickling down out of my anus into my pubic hair, mingling with the nectar flowing from my woman-flower. I wriggle back a little, taking him in a finger-breadth deeper. Then a little more. He gently presses forward. Slowly, slowly, the enormous butter-coated shaft slides deeper and deeper into my rectum, till at last he is completely buried in me. We stay like that for some time. The feeling of fullness is quite overwhelming. He licks my shoulders and neck. I coo with pleasure. My son's phallus feels so deliciously warm and alive, deep inside me. His hands begin to fondle and knead my heavy breasts, his fingers playing with my nipples, making them leak milk.  Asterion cannot understand my speech, but somehow he can read my body with perfect understanding, knowing exactly when I am ready for him to start. He withdraws a little, then slides it back home. Then again, a little more forcefully this time. And again. Soon he is pounding into my rectum with all his might, his heavy testicles slapping against my buttocks and thighs, as I whimper and keen and wail and come again and again; my nectar repeatedly spraying out all over his thighs; my breasts leaking milk, soaking the bed; my legs trembling. His breathing becomes more and more excited. He is close, I know.  My thoughts all turn to mush, and I'm aware of nothing but the glorious battering ram pounding deep in my rectum. At last he tenses up and bellows, filling my bowels with his hot seed.  He withdraws, with a final caress and squeeze of my buttocks. My body is completely limp now, as though every bone in me had melted away. My legs are still shaking. Tenderly he lifts me back into bed, then rolls in beside me. I lie back, too exhausted to move. I feel a gush of his seed spilling out of my gaping anus, wetting the mattress beneath me, along with all my other fluids. The servants will have to clean that up later.  Presently, Astarion pulls and lifts me so that I am mostly lying on top of him, my head resting on his chest. His hand strokes my hair. I look into his eyes and smile.  ""Hmmagh-hmmagh.""  ""I love you too, son. Thank you.""  * * *  We rest in each others arms for some time, recovering. Eventually, we switch positions, with him resting his head on my breasts. He takes one of them in his mouth, licking my nipple with his tongue. (Asterion's frequent sucking at my breasts, whenever we lie together, has caused me to be in milk once again.) I sigh with relief and pleasure now as he nurses, emptying out both sides.  I cradle his head against me, tenderly caressing his brow and horns.  ""We can continue this later, son. It is time for our bath. I think we both need it after that, darling.""  We make our way, arm in arm, to the bathing chamber. He rubs oil on my body and scrapes it off with a strigil. As he kneels down, I pour water over him, then scrub his fur vigorously with a boar-bristle brush. I pour oil over his phallus and scrotum, and lovingly rub it in with my hand. We both plunge into the pool to rinse off. The cold water revives me. I can think again now. And it soothes my sore sphincter muscles.  It seems that all that pounding has given us quite an appetite. We put our clothes back on, and I summon the servants, who have been waiting by the cave entrance. They bring in our evening meal and serve it up: tonight it is grilled sea bream on a bed of spinach leaves, with plenty of fresh-baked flatbread, washed down with a crisp resiny white wine. I am a hearty eater, but Asterion, of course, eats four times more.  One of the servants changes our bed-linen, as the other one lights the lamps.  ""Will there be anything else this evening, my Goddess?""  ""No, that is all. You may leave us.""  Of course the servants know perfectly well what goes on between my son and me. They probably could hear everything a short while ago: my cries and his bellowing, and the slapping together of our flesh. They can see the state of our bed. The caves smell strongly of our coupling. Of course rumours of this circulate among the broader population. But my people are already accustomed to pretending not to acknowledge the scandal of Asterion's existence. If I lie with my son, that is simply one more shocking little scandal for them to pretend to ignore.  Asterion now takes me to his work chamber, showing me the model ship he made today. I took him to the harbour only once, when he was four years old; he has not seen a ship since that day. Yet he has created an accurate model - sail, oars, rigging and all. It is marvellous. I praise him for the model at great length. This will make an excellent gift for Kikeru, the harbour-master. Asterion does not understand my words, but he understands that I am pleased with his work, and he is content.  But my time with my son is precious. Only a few more hours before we sleep. I cannot carry on conversations with him; we communicate in a more primal way. The anal pounding earlier took a lot out of me, but I am ready for more now. I lead him back to the bed-chamber. I shed my bodice and skirts again, lying back in bed. My son, naked as well, climbs on top of me, between my open thighs. He licks and feeds at my breasts for some time, making me shiver with love and desire.  ""Please son!"" I beg.  Once again, I feel that glorious tree-trunk of a phallus slide into my woman-sheath, filling me up so perfectly. His pace is slower this time, less frantic - but just as forceful: a long, steady pounding. I grip his powerful shoulders; I grab his horns and pull his face down to kiss me. After some time, I turn over onto my knees and elbows, so he can pound into me from behind. He keeps going for over an hour. I come and come and come again, I know not how many times. At last, he comes too, bellowing and spurting his seed deep within me.  I am his mother; I am his cow in heat.  Afterwards, I take him in my mouth, deep in my throat. I receive my after-meal treat, yet another measure of his precious seed, filling my stomach.  * * *  The next morning as I dress, I try to clasp my girdle. It is too tight. I must loosen it. This is the second time I have loosened it. Suddenly I recall: my moon-blood did not come last month. I am well into the second month.  Well well.  It is hardly surprising, with all the seed he has been pumping into my womb. No morning sickness this time: that is a blessing. A little sister or brother for Asterion. As the realization hits me, I begin floating in a cloud of joy.  As I give my son his morning breastfeeding, I try to convey to him the good news, with words and gestures, that I am with child - his child. But he does not understand. He only sees that I am suddenly very happy, not knowing why. Of course he has no memory of my previous pregnancy: he was inside me! He does not understand where children come from. Or does he? Well, he will find out soon enough. He will see the changes in my body. Two months gone, in seven more months he will be confronted with a little infant, bovine or human or some mixture of the two, perhaps without any inkling of what is coming. I shall hate not being able to explain this to him.  Well, I shall have to keep him reassured that all is well, with me, and between us. That much I can do. When I take his phallus in my mouth, all care and sadness leave him. I lick my lips, looking forward to these reassurance sessions.  If it is a girl, I shall call her Ariadne. It means ""most holy"", a fitting name for our future Goddess. I hope it will be a girl.";;;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
45899866;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Prometheus looked at the fireplace. The wood had burned to embers. He knew that putting more wood on the fire would be of no use. On the other hand, to leave firewood unburnt would also be of no use, so he put some. He remembered that he had to take care of his work. Happily, he had always kept his records in order after Mecone. Nevertheless, he checked them, and wrote a note with some tips for Apollo who would take over his job.  A vision appeared: As the Far-Shooter goes through the house of Zeus, the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his bow. But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus the Thunderer; and then she unstrings her son's bow, and closes his quiver, and takes his archery from his shoulders in her hands and hangs them on a golden peg against a pillar of his father's house. Then she leads him to a seat and makes him sit, and she rejoices because she bare a mighty son and an archer.  This has happened countless times. But one day, Apollo will not give his bow...  Prometheus wondered what this could mean. Would the arrows bring about someone's death? This was unlikely, for none of those who dwelled on Olympus could be killed by an arrow. There were some conditionally immortal and ambrosia-dependent but they consumed enough ambrosia to become indistinguishable from true immortals. Maybe someone who had angered Apollo would receive a painful wound, or lose an eye. While Prometheus was considering this, the vision changed.  The Olympians were standing in a circle in the hall with the marble columns. Zeus was sitting on his throne, and Apollo was standing in front of him, holding a beautifully decorated jar with both hands. The jar was familiar to Prometheus from an earlier vision which had appeared when Athena had talked about contagious diseases. Now, Apollo was so eager not to drop it that his fingers were pressing it with full force, and had become white. He said to his father:  'I have filled it. But let me say again that I disapprove the idea. Once we let these creatures loose, we cannot control them. They are unlikely to break through our protections but can spread to the livestock and decimate our herds.'  'We'll take the chance,' said Zeus firmly. He outstretched his hands, and Apollo handed him the jar.  'Hermes, bring her!' commanded Zeus. Hermes went out and soon returned, accompanied by a modest human maiden. With dismay, Prometheus recognized Pandora, Eurydamus' eldest granddaughter whom he had always disliked for no apparent reason. Now, she was bathed and girded and clothed in fine garments that looked like Athena's work, with necklaces of gold and a crown with spring flowers. She was quite pretty for a human, and prepared and adorned this way, she looked as sweet and lovely as a nymph or even an immortal goddess.  'You are true to your name now, Pandora,' said Zeus, 'because all they who dwell on Olympus gave each a gift to you. Here is my gift.' He handed her the jar. 'It brings luck. But you should never open it. Now, Hermes will lead you to your future husband.'  The image faded but Prometheus figured out who the husband would be. Long ago, as if in another life, Epimetheus had stated that Zeus would find him a wife, and then at the betrothal party of Alksanor and Anthea he had said that he'd marry a human woman. Why hadn't Prometheus paid more attention? After all, it was logical for Epimetheus to be a seer like his brother, for their threads of life were identical.  Prometheus briefly considered going to Epimetheus to give a more specific warning, but it was too late. He heard approaching steps, then a loud knock at the door, and the voice of Kratos: 'Open in the name of Zeus!' So he stood up and opened the door.  *** To describe in details what followed, would be pain for the writer and not pleasant for the reader. Let's just mention that at the trial, which took place as soon as Pronoia arrived, the Cyclopes were summoned as witnesses. They testified that Prometheus had been at the forge with a stem of giant fennel, apparently to steal the fire. He denied, and then Themis solemnly stated:  'There are crimes more outrageous than lying to the court, but there is hardly a crime more shameful. May he who utters a lie in this hall be afflicted by a cruel fate, and removed from our community forever!'  'So be it!' said Prometheus.  Themis smiled, for she did not know the truth, and thought that Prometheus was lying and had just cursed himself. Zeus, however, knew more, and though not particularly superstitious, flinched for a moment. Prometheus, however, was sad, because he thought that he would never return, and the gods would consider him not only a thief but also a liar.  After that, Zeus pronounced the sentence of Prometheus: to be nailed to Mount Caucasus and kept bound, and every third day an eagle would swoop on him and devour the lobes of his liver, which would then grow again. As the shocked audience gasped, Zeus smiled, looking at Prometheus, and then his look turned to Pronoia.  Only then Prometheus realized that, when the punishment would exhaust his body and make him lose consciousness permanently and stop existing as a sentient being, Zeus could pronounce him dead, and force himself on Pronoia. After all, the Thunderer had sworn never to touch another god's wife, but had promised nothing about other gods' widows. Prometheus had to think fast. He remembered his conversation with Thetis, and an idea came to him that seemed good at the moment. So he said loudly:  'Yet the day will come when you, Zeus, although stubborn of soul, shall be humbled, seeing that you plan a marriage that shall hurl you into oblivion from your sovereignty and throne; and then your father Cronus' curse shall be fulfilled to the uttermost. Deliverance from such ruin no one of the gods can show except me. Such an adversary are you now preparing despite yourself, a prodigy irresistible, even one who shall discover a flame mightier than the lightning and a deafening crash to outroar the thunder. Then, wrecked upon this evil, you shall learn how different it is to be a sovereign and a slave.'  As the audience gasped again, Zeus laughed and said:  'Is this the best false prophecy you can invent, son of Iapetus? Falsely the gods call you Prometheus! Your pathetic attempted blackmail will not succeed, and I swear by the Styx that you shall remain chained to the crag forever!'  The same day Hermes flew Prometheus to the Caucasus, Kratos and Bia brought him to the crag, and Hephaestus bound him.  *** Zeus, indeed, did not intend to succumb to blackmail. The only concession he made was periodically sending the Erinyes to give Prometheus food and water to sustain his conscious life, a detail that was not included in the original sentence. The goddesses were apparently not happy with their new job, and vented their neverending anger at the prisoner.  At night, when the pain from the wound slightly subsided and Prometheus could think a little, he sometimes saw fragmented visions of the events in the inhabitable lands across the sea. More detailed and specific, though less accurate tidings were coming from Hermes, who was visiting almost as often as the Erinyes. His mission was to try and extract from Prometheus the name of the goddess who, if being raped by Zeus, would produce a son who would take his father's throne. In return for this vital information, he promised nothing. For some mysterious reason, Hermes - and by extension, Zeus - seemed to think that Prometheus would wish to help his torturer just so, without getting anything for himself or those he loved. The titan had barely been bound when Hermes came and spoke to him:  'To you, the clever and crafty, bitter beyond all bitterness, who has sinned against the gods in bestowing honors upon creatures of a day--to you, thief of fire, I speak. The Father commands that you tell what marriage you boast of, whereby he is to be hurled from power--and this, mark well, set forth in no riddling fashion, but point by point, as the case exactly stands; and do not impose upon me a double journey, Prometheus--you see Zeus is not appeased by dealings such as yours.'  'Only if he releases me, and the other prisoners, and swears to leave the humans alone,' replied Prometheus. He had figured out that Zeus' oath not to release him would be easily circumvented by wearing a bracelet or even a ring with an embedded piece of the crag. But the important thing was that Zeus had no intention whatsoever to release him, under any circumstances. So the negotiations ended before they had even begun.     About half a year later, Hermes brought news about Prometheus' family: 'Congratulations, you have become a father! Pronoia gave birth to a son, and named him Deucalion. Such an adorable baby, it will be a pity if he suffers because of the resentment evoked by his father's deeds. Why not try and earn a little goodwill by revealing with whom Zeus should not have a son?' Prometheus flinched and reminded to himself that Zeus had sworn by the Styx not to hurt the children of his enemies.     The next news brough by Hermes soon after that were more political:  'We are all working hard to amend the impact of your crimes, that is, giving the creatures of a day meat and fire. Do you know of the invisible things causing pestilence among mortal life? Apollo has collected many of them and placed them in a jar. It will be given to a mortal woman with a warning not to open it, under the presumption that her fear will override her curiosity for some time, so that when she finally opens the jar, it will have maximum effect. And because even a stupid female human would be suspicious if the Olympians give her a gift without a reason, it will be given as a wedding present. Yes, because she will marry your feeble-minded brother Epimetheus. Then we suppose that she will convince him to join her tribe, because humans live in swarms and his house will be too lonely for her. And we suppose that Father Zeus' advise to her not to open the jar will make her just postpone the opening until she is with her people, where the things can spread well. It is just and right that your brother will bring doom to the mortals whom you in self-will reverenced too much. They will most likely be extinct in a few years.'  'No, they won't. Their bodies have good defenses. Some will survive,' said Prometheus. But he knew that many would die, most of them young children, and while this attack would be survived by some humans, the next one would not be.     A year or two later, Hermes mentioned Deucalion again:  'You said that the humans have good defenses against diseases, didn't you? Well, some may have but most haven't. Especially the children, they are dying in droves. Hopefully your son also has good defenses, and also good luck to save him from accidents, because he will live among the disease-ridden human tribes. He became an unbearable troublemaker, and Zeus told his mother to send him somewhere else. She could send him to her father but instead chose a savage human tribe to foster him! Your wife is apparently no less crazy than you, and your unfortunate child is suffering because of it.'  Prometheus had calculated that any children he would have with Pronoia would be protected against contagion, and only in the next generation would the protections break down. He could only hope that his conclusions were correct.  'This was Zeus' plan,' he said. Hermes didn't even understand what he was talking about.     About thirty years after his binding, Prometheus started to get more and more visions about the coming flood, with the clear outlines of an inevitable future. Hermes confirmed his forebodings.  'A human chieftain named Lycaon tried to serve Father Zeus a meal of human flesh,' he said. 'Father destroyed him and his family, but not one house alone deserved to perish; over all the earth ferocious deeds prevail, with all of your men conspiring in evil. Father will cleanse the earth with a great deluge, and then will people the earth with a better race, unlike this one. Athena and Hephaestus will correct everything that is wrong with the humans. So your crimes will finally be undone. You chose to give the humans beef and fire; in their lands, there will soon be no oxen, no fire, and the humans themselves will no longer be there.'  'There is nothing wrong with the humans,' Prometheus objected. 'They are perfect.'  'Well, I guess you are entitled to your opinion. But it will not save them. Their perfection, or lack thereof, will soon become a thing of the past.'     Then Prometheus had visions of the flood in real time. Zeus gathered all the rain clouds over the inhabited land and made them pour their burden. The torrent destroyed the crops but most humans survived. Now was the turn of Poseidon, Oceanus and the river gods. Subterranean waters bursted as fountains, rivers swell, and the sea hit the land with giant waves. People, livestock, houses, shrines and trees were swept by the water mass. But when it drained into the sea, many were still alive. They were fighting the elements, building dikes, making boats and rafts. Then Zeus told all the gods that if they didn't want to suffer his wrath, they had to do the job properly this time, and not halfway as with Pandora's jar. Then Poseidon the Earth-Shaker raised his trident high and brought it down with full force. The earth shook, and the entire plain inside the mountain ring descended. The salt waters found their way and poured inside with irresistible force. Where humans had lived, was now one vast expanse, the land and sea were mingled in the waste of endless waves--a sea without a shore, dark and turbulent like new wine.  When the goal was achieved, Poseidon raised his trident again. The submerged lands rose approximately to their previous level, and the waves calmed down. But the mountain ring still held the mass of water. Therefore Poseidon smote with his trident the narrow space between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, where the Peneus was making its way to the sea. The stroke expanded the Gate of Peneus into a deep gorge that finally let the water flow out. Much later, it would be named the Vale of Tempe.     It was actually not forbidden for gods to visit Prometheus, they just refrained from doing so. But after the flood, some Oceanids took their father's flying cart and ventured over the Caucasus. They wanted to tell Prometheus what fate had befallen the humans, so that he wouldn't hear about it only from Hermes, and also to reassure him that his son Deucalion and Deucalion's wife Pyrrha, daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora, were safe.  The Oceanids were outraged by Zeus' atrocities but at the same time too frightened to speak out loudly. And then Prometheus remembered that the Cyclopes had sworn to stop serving Zeus if the gods would renounce his rule. For the first time since the gift of fire, he saw a faint hope. He spoke to the Oceanids, fanned the flames of their anger, and made them forget their fear. And when Hermes arrived from Olympus, they openly proclaimed their rebellion. However, Zeus swore that he would stop torturing Prometheus with the eagle only if one of the ambrosia-dependent Oceanids, or another ambrosia-dependent descendant of Uranus and Gaea, would give up their ambrosia for his sake. Then he summoned a storm which dispersed the Oceanids.  'Congratulations, misnamed titan!' said mockingly Hermes during his next visit. 'It was a folly to instigate a rebellion among the Oceanids. Did you really think that with a bunch of barefoot girls for an army, you could shake the rule of Zeus? If you hoped that it would make the Cyclopes switch sides, you were wrong. They preferred to break the hasty oath they had sworn, remain loyal to Father Zeus and suffer the consequences. But they will eventually recover. I am not so sure about the Oceanids. They refused to say which ones had visited you and rebelled, and I could not identify them because they were masked. So Father Zeus deprived them all of ambrosia. Those of them who are dependent will die. So, though not one of them volunteered to sacrifice herfelf for your sake, they will nevertheless die because of you. And by the way, your son proved as stupid as you. Father Zeus granted him a wish, within the limits of the normal. He could demand immortality for himself and his wife, and join our people. He could ask for your release, but apparently he couldn't care less about you. Instead, he wanted humans. He squandered his wish, because Father Zeus would populate the earth with a new generation of humans anyway. Well, I suppose that he will feel well among the new humans, because they have been made stupid like him, and maybe more. Athena and Hephaestus were eager to correct your mistake of making the humans too clever, and touched some key points in the thread of life to make them dumb. I don't think any of the new humans will ever show me a written word. And if you hope for any help from them, you'll be disappointed.'  After some years, Hermes provided an update about the Oceanids:  'Moved by the repentance of the Oceanids and the pleas of their father, Zeus in his mercy has waived their punishment. Unfortunately, it seems to have been too late for the youngest one, with the fewest protections. Despite eating ambrosia again, she continues to deteriorate. She already has wrinkles, and Apollo is pessimistic.'  Apollo was right. Some thirty years later, Hermes reported again:  'Do you remember Leuce, the stupid Oceanid who had the folly to rebel against Zeus at your bidding? Well, she died, as expected. And she spent her last years in Hades' cave because she had become too abhorrent to show herself in public.'  *** Zeus forced himself on Pyrrha, niece and daughter in-law of Prometheus, and so she gave birth to his son, and had to bring him up together with her husband. Prometheus saw in his visions the ugly scene, and then Pyrrha crying in the arms of Deucalion. Hermes preferred to keep his mouth shut about this. Otherwise, he seemed to enjoy telling Prometheus about Zeus' atrocities, especially those directed against anyone who would try to benefit the humans.  'Do you know about Plutus son of Demeter?' he asked once. 'He mingled with the humans, taught them how to prosper. Father Zeus summoned him back to Olympus but he tried to hide among the mortals. Well, he was soon caught of course, and Father intends to sentence him to death.'  'He shouldn't,' Prometheus said. 'Nothing to warrant death.'  'Oh really? You think you have the say about other people's deserts? You are funny!'  After some time, they had practically the same conversation about some son of Apollo named Asclepius who had become a better healer than his father and there were rumours that given enough time, he would overcome mortality itself. Hermes cheerfully stated that the youth would be thunderbolted, and there was nothing Prometheus could do about it.  *** So the years were passing, and as Prometheus was forced to endure pain and cold he could not tolerate for long, he gradually disintegrated, disappeared, and I took his place to occupy the pathetic remnant of his body. And each third woeful day, with dreadful swoop, the eagle of Zeus with his hooked talons rent me asunder by his cruel repast. Then, crammed and glutted to the full on my fat liver, it uttered a prodigious scream and, soaring aloft, with winged tail fawned upon my gore. But when my gnawed liver swelled, renewed in growth, greedily would it return anew to its fell repast. Thus did I feed this guardian of my awful torture, who mutilated me living with never-ending pain. For fettered, by the bonds of Zeus, I had no power to drive from my vitals the accursed bird. Thus, robbed of self-defence, I endured woes fraught with torment. And this my ancient dolorous agony, intensified by the dreadful centuries, was fastened upon my body, from which there fell, melted by the blazing sun, drops that unceasingly poured upon the rocks of Caucasus.  *** One morning in early spring, as I was sleeping in the last hours before the coming of the eagle, I heard someone calling me. I opened my eyes and saw Arce standing right in front of me. The poor one was gaunt, her eyes were sunken, and her skin was too pale even for the meager light of the dawn, as if she has not seen the sun for many centuries - which of course was the truth. A pair of engines was fastened to her back, explaining how she had reached me.  'Prometheus, are you hearing me?' she asked anxiously. 'It's me, Arke. I came to see you.'  'Arke...' I repeated her name.  'Yes! You recognize me, don't you? I feared that you wouldn't, or you wouldn't speak.'  'I am sorry...' I said, trying to apologize for my contribution to her misfortune. She understood what I meant.  'Don't think of this! We are well now. We are free, we live on an island. Your mother is with us. She loves you very much. And your father, and Menoetius also send their love.'  I had ruined their lives, and they still loved me. I tried to tell her to send my love to them but nothing intelligible came out of my mouth. Arce brought from her cloak a small vial.  'Apollo gave me some potion,' she explained. 'He said that it would give you strength for a little while. Can you raise your head?'  I tried to but could not. Arke held my forehead with one hand, and with the other poured the content of the vial into my mouth. Then she brought out a larger bottle. She shook it, then shook it again, looked inside and her face sunk with despair.  'Apollo told me to give it with plenty of water... And you must be thirsty... But my water has frozen! We flew high... and now it is all ice!'  'Never mind.'  'Oh Prometheus! It breaks my heart to behold you like this!'  'Paying for my mistakes...'  'Oh please forget this! Now, listen! Zeus has sent me.'  She made a pause, apparently to be sure that I had understood her words. I raised my head. I felt stronger than I had been for many decades. Apparently the potion had begun to act.  'He wants to negotiate with you,' Arke continued. 'That's why I came. Hermes came with me but hid behind that crag. Zeus told him so, fearing that if you see him, you'll refuse to speak.'  'He's right.'  'We flew all night over the sea with these things,' Arke pointed at one of her engines. Then she cautiously looked around and added in a lower voice, 'We didn't take the flying cart.'  'I understand.'  'I have a message for you, from Zeus. A hero will soon come here. His name is Heracles, and he is son of Zeus from some human woman...'  I remembered Pronoia's old hypothesis - she turned out to be correct after all. The human women who had been doomed to shiver, starve, die of contagions and finally be drowned, were now considered good enough for the bed of the king of the gods.  '...So Zeus ordered me to tell you that if you reveal the secret, he'll allow Heracles to kill the eagle and stop your torture,' continued Arke.  'Do you know Zeus' condition?' I asked.  'You mean that some dependent must volunteer to die?'  I nodded.  'I heard that someone has agreed but I don't know the details. You may ask Hermes about this. You'll demand him to swear an oath.'  'Zeus wants me here. Didn't send the cart.'  'Yes, he apparently wants to deceive you. Be careful! But you must stop being so stubborn, and then he may free you as he freed us. Don't you want to be unbound, to leave this horrible place?'  I didn't answer, for I felt too weak to explain to Arke that I had nowhere to go. Even if Zeus would agree to return me to my loved ones, how could I force myself on them, after all the sorrow I had caused them? Because of me taking Zeus' side in the war, my father and my brother Menoetius had been imprisoned, and Atlas had been exiled. I had broken my mother's heart, ruined Pronoia's life, and extinguished all joy from the life of Hephaestus. The Oceanids surely hated my after my words had led to Leuce's death. And Athena wouldn't want even to look at me in my current miserable state.  'Prometheus, we acknowledged Zeus' rule!' Arke continued, her voice trembling with passionate begging. 'His father Cronus acknowledged it, and your father also, and even Perses! The humans worship Zeus, build altars and temples and sacrifice to him! Only you still resist him. This is pointless! He will not fall from power - never!'  She unbound her cloak and started to take it off.  'You what?' I asked.  'I'll wrap you in this. You are quite cold. How didn't I figure out to take another one!'  'Don't! You'll freeze on the way back.' I felt vaguely the near future and added, 'And no need.'  'There is definitely a need!'  'The hero will give me. Soon.'  'Are you sure?'  'Yes. He's near...'  A loud whistling pierced the air.  'You're right,' said Arke hastily. 'This is a signal from Hermes. I must leave. Please remember what I told you!'  After these words, she turned on her engines and took off.     A stranger was approaching now, carefully choosing his path up the crag. He was so tall and bulky that from a distance, one could mistake him for Kratos. He was clad in a lion's skin, holding a bow in his left hand and carrying a backpack and a quiver on his back. He apparently took after his father, for he looked like a god - I couldn't see any human features. Instead, I saw in my mind much about his past and future.  The hero stopped in front of me, looked at me in dismay, staring at my wound, then hesitantly uttered:  'Hail!'  'Hail.'  'I am Heracles, son of Alcmene and Zeus.'  'I know about you... You look like your father.'  'You are Prometheus, aren't you?'  'Yes. Prometheus who gave fire to mankind.'  'I've heard about you... But even if I hadn't, I'd figure out that you are one of the immortals.' Heracles apparently meant that no mortal could look like this and still be alive.  'Your father punished me for helping the humans.'  'For how long have you been bound here?'  'For as long as you have fire. Almost three centuries.'  Heracles looked shocked but at the same time doubtful.  'Did you perhaps transgress even somewhat beyond this offence?' he asked.  'Yes. I gave the humans meat. And Zeus wanted me to reveal him something.'  'Some important secret?'  'His rule depends on it.'  'Why don't you reveal it, then?'  'Because he keeps me here.'  'If you disclose it, he may release you.'  'Not so easy.'  'You must concede. You cannot fight against the ruler of the world.'  'I can. And I do.'  'I want to help you but you make it very difficult.'  'I want no help... Go on your way.'  Heracles was stunned. After a short silence, he caught me on my last words:  'I have lost my way. I have wandered in this wilderness for days.'  'I'll tell you. But first the bird must go away.'  'So that about the eagle is also true? Has it caused your wound?'  'You'll see.'  'When will it come?'  'Any moment. Look up...'  I didn't need to look up myself because after all these years, I could feel the approaching eagle even without seeing it. Heracles turned his face to the sky and his expression changed.  'Why didn't you tell me earlier?' he cried and sprang to action. He drew his bow, brought out an arrow and prayed: 'May Hunter Apollo speed my arrow straight!' Then he shot at his target. The eagle was pierced by the accurate arrow on the wing. Its limp body hit the rock and then fall into the precipice to crash down below.     'Immense thanks!' I said. 'You are a great shooter... and of your sire, mine enemy, the dearest son. Now, about the road...'  'Wait a moment,' said Heracles. He took a piece of cloth from his backpack and bandaged my wound. Then brought out a cloak and wrapped me in it. I was thirsty and wanted to ask him for water but thought better of it. Whatever water he had, would be of more use to him.  'Thank you!' I said. 'Nobody has taken care of me like this... since Zeus separated me from my family. Now listen and write...'  'I cannot write.'  'Write on the tablet of your mind. Where do you travel?'  'To Hesperia. I must retrieve some golden apples from Atlas' garden.'  'It's far... And you're going in the wrong direction. You must return. Follow the straight road west... until you leave Caucasus and reach... the big water. Then to the north-west, along the coast...'  As I supplied all the information I had, Heracles was listening carefully and apparently trying to remember every word.  'You'll come to the Ligurians, where you shall not be eager for battle...'  'Why not?'  'It's fated that your arrows will fail you there, and you won't be able to take from the ground any stone, because the whole place is smooth. But your father will pity you and, holding above you a cloud, will shower the land with round stones. Hurling these, you'll drive back the Ligurian host...'  Heracles was paying attention to every word, though he looked a little incredulous, especially when he heard that his father would pity him and help him. 'And when you reach Atlas... don't step into his garden. You won't come out alive, it's full of venomous snakes. Ask him to bring the... fruit.'  'The golden apples?'  'Yes. I forget words,' I explained needlessly. 'You help Atlas in return. But don't let him give you all his work. Don't tell him you've seen me! He's my brother but is angry at me. But to Hades you can say that you're my friend... Your last labor will bring you to his realm. You'll have to bring Cerberus out of there...'  'Oh no!'  'It's less dangerous than it seems.'  'But I'm not immortal.'  'Just beware the Erinyes. And be polite to Hades and Kore... I mean Persephone. Try not to hurt their dog, they love him. You'll have to catch him with your bare hands. Don't touch its middle head, he hates this. Show him to Eurystheus and then return him to his owners... Then part with your wife and don't marry again! But if you do... be faithful to your new wife. If by chance you injure yourself on one of your arrows... quickly immerse the wound in hot water. As hot as you can endure, even more.  I paused, thinking what else Heracles needed to know, but this seemed to be all I knew that could be useful to him. So I added:  'Go now! It's too high for you here.'  'I want to unbind you,' said Heracles, 'but I'm afraid of angering my father. If you agree to tell him the secret...'  'It's pointless. He'll keep me here.'  'Why are you so sure?'  'For a term of my agony... someone of my people should give away his portion of ambrosia and die of his own free will... This is the condition.'  'This cannot be true!' shouted Heracles. 'Now, what will he do? Send another eagle?'  'I don't know.'  He put his backpack on the ground, sat down on it and stared into the snowy peaks at the horizon.     While the hero was sitting, immersed in deep thought, Hermes flew in and landed next to him.  'Hail Heracles!' he greeted, then turned to Prometheus: 'Why did you tell him? Why are you whining like some woman? Maybe you want to fill him with pity so that he doesn't descend in time and freezes? A single night spent at this altitude will kill him! Is this what you want? Too many people have already died because of you, enough is enough!'  'Because of me?' I asked with indignation. 'Did I fill Pandora's... box? Did I make the flood?'  'All this happened because of you,' insisted Hermes. 'If you are so clever, you had to figure out what the consequences of your deeds would be. The humans were doomed the moment you matched yourself in wit with Zeus, tried to trick him and gave him the worse portion of the sacrificial ox, and reserved the better portion for the creatures of a day...' Hermes stopped suddenly, realizing that he was speaking in front of a ""creature of a day"". He paused for a moment, then turned directly to Heracles: 'You need not pity this titan. For by his own proud wilfulness he brought himself to this harbor of distress. And he is a dangerous rebel. He would be unbearable if he were prosperous. You heard him first-hand that he refuses to reveal the secret he knows. He wants Zeus to fall from power, and the world to fall into chaos. Back in the past, he hoped to take your father's place after toppling him with the help of the humans. Therefore he pretended to help them but in fact used them and brought disasters upon their heads...'  'That's not true!' I interrupted him. 'I wanted this not.'  'Then why did you do everything? Out of pure hatred to your people?' Hermes turned to Heracles again and continued: 'In fact, this is possible. He is mad, one of those people about whom nobody knows why they are born and why they live. From one like him, you can expect anything. He had created the humans pitifully ugly and pitheci-like, and liked them this way! Zeus and other Olympians had to work hard to improve the human race. You saw that Prometheus disliked your appearance, your resemblance to Father. He was disappointed that a son of Zeus came to his rescue. Maybe he was waiting for his old friends, who were drowned because of him ages ago, to rise from the sea bottom and come to help him!'  I said nothing but couldn't help flinching. Heracles was also listening in silence, and becoming paler and paler. Hermes continued, apparently not noticing his reaction:  'Nevertheless, Father Zeus ceased from the wrath which he had before, and allowed you to kill the eagle so that to regard and honor you. Now, your glory might be yet greater than it was before. You must be happy and proud.'  Heracles didn't reply, and seemed to be thinking of something else. Then his face brightened.  'I know one who is of the divine folk and wants to die,' he said. 'My friend, the centaur Chiron. I unintentionally injured him with a poisoned arrow. Now, he is having an incurable would causing him great pain. He has told me that he wishes just to complete some affairs, and then he'll stop eating ambrosia so that he finally gets rid of his misery.'  'Really?' asked Hermes, acting surprised. 'Do you think he has spoken seriously?'  'I am sure. Chiron is no whiner. So if he wants to die... this means that Prometheus can be pardoned, doesn't it?'  'Oh yes. If he reveals the secret, no bird of prey will visit him anymore. Heracles, you did a great job! Time to go on your way. Farewell!'  'Prometheus, you'll say this great secret now, won't you?' asked Heracles.  I tried to smile, with little success.  'You and Chiron saved me,' I whispered. 'I knew... I knew that you would come. But so long time passed that I no longer believed... Zeus' servants kept saying that the humans wouldn't help me, ever... But you came!'  Heracles looked down and blushed. Then he looked at me again and admitted:  'I didn't decide it myself. Iris came to me and said that Zeus sends me to find you and rescue you from the dreadful bird.'  'Doesn't matter. You came, that matters. And it speaks well of you that you told me. Thank you again! And give my thanks to Chiron. Now, go! Farewell!'  'Farewell!' replied Heracles.     He turned back and walked down the narrow path. To my eyes, he soon became as small as a dot, and finally disappeared behind a turn of the path. Hermes was standing in front of me, looking satisfied by this development.  'As you heard,' he said, 'the worthy Chiron sacrificed himself for you, the unworthy. This gives you a chance, if you prove that you deserve it. Come on, speak at last!'  There was something important I had to reveal, but it wasn't what Hermes wanted from me.  'Listen!' I said. 'In a few years... Gaea's sons will attack Olympus.'  'The giants?'  'Yes... You can't defeat them without Heracles... Tell Zeus to protect him... He'll soon go to the Ligurians... You all must help him, send him stones to defend himself. Otherwise, he'll be killed and you'll be done for. I swear by Styx!'  'Very well. I see that you are becoming reasonable, good! Now, all you need to do is say the name.'  'If I say it... shall I be free?  'No, it's impossible. You are doomed to stay bound to this crag...'  'It's enough to carry a piece of it.'  'Oh you also figured this out, didn't you? You can still move your brain a little when it suits you. But you are too deep in crime to be accepted back among us. First, you stole the fire and gave it to the humans...'  'Don't call others thieves.'  'Don't compare your wickedness to my jokes! Anyway, you have succumbed to your philanthropy - why did you then decide to anger Zeus? Had you kept your big mouth shut, the theft of fire would have been forgiven and forgotten long ago. But there's no way to fix the past. The only thing you can do now is spare yourself further suffering.'  'I want back to my wife,' I said.  'Back to your wife? Who told you that Pronoia is still your wife? She of course suffered greatly in the beginning, you ruined her life. But then she became accustomed to living without you, and she is well now. She first lived with Athena, then moved in with Hephaestus. He parted with Aphrodite and remarried.'  This news saddened me deeply, though I knew that I was being selfish, and I should be glad for Pronoia. Wasn't it best for her to marry Hephaestus? She didn't deserve eternal solitude, and even less did she deserve to be saddled with what her first husband had turned into.  Why return, indeed? The gods had forgotten me, or were hating me. For all this time, nobody had visited me except Zeus' messengers, the mad Io (once) and the Oceanids (once). Same for the humans. Only Heracles had come to rescue me from the eagle but this had not been his idea. And he hadn't offered me even a mouthful of water. Indeed, he had bandaged and cloaked me, so at least I wasn't naked like a beast. But this was nothing more than the humans were doing for their dead to prepare them for the funeral. And he had left me to deal with Hermes myself. This was like a final sentence. All my life, all my deeds had been a giant failure.  Then I remembered another loved one, the last being who could still reconnect me to life:  'I had a brother. Epimetheus.'  'He has forgotten you long ago. Don't you understand that no one is waiting for you and no one wants you? You cannot see yourself from aside. You are a pathetic sight, like a skeleton covered with skin, except where you have wounds, hanging on your chains like a piece of carrion, and stinking like one. You talk in two-word sentences, worse than Epimetheus. Nobody needs you. You're good for nothing except to show what fate awaits those who rebel against Zeus. Why do you want to be free when you have nowhere to go? At least get rid of your torment. Why are you still deliberating? One could think you revel in your present plight!'  I felt that Hermes was trying to deceive me, but couldn't figure out where exactly the deception was and what I should say and do. Once upon a time, I had mocked his simple mind. Fate had punished my arrogance, for I was now much dumber than Hermes had ever been. And if I were honest, I could not blame him for hating me. He was so much younger, and kin to me, and I had never done anything for him. After all, it was not his fault that he had been born and grown up in the era of Zeus.  Then a sudden realization hit me like an avalanche.  Pronoia had ended her marriage with me, and had wedded Hephaestus. She was now the wife of another god. Even without me, she was protected. I didn't need to cling to life and suffer. I was free. And with no more mechanical birds of prey to rend me (something was telling me that Hephaestus would not produce another eagle), I could fall asleep into eternal oblivion, forever free of pain and sorrow, like Dromaeus in those long past days.  Overcome with relief, I wanted to say something nice to Hermes, the last sentient being I'd speak with.  'Whenever there is something important, you come.'  'Yes, this is an important day for you.' He of course did not understand me. 'Now, reveal the secret, and everything will be over. Just tell me the name!'  I wanted him to go away and leave me alone. I could tell Thetis' name, but why give his father what he wanted? I decided to enrage Hermes and make him lose his temper. I remembered my old prophecy that Zeus would bring misfortune upon himself if he would rape Leto, and said:  'Leto. But he's already done it.'  'How dare you! You hopeless scoundrel!' he shouted. He slapped me in the face, looked at his hand and thoroughly rubbed it with snow. Then, without a word, he turned back and took off.  Finally alone, I looked at the white peaks and the bright blue sky which was no longer menacing. The view was beautiful, and brought peace of mind. I wanted to enjoy it for a little longer, but the effect of the potion was wearing off and my eyelids were drooping. Not trying to resist anymore, I closed my eyes. It was time to sleep.";;;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
591456;;;;;Sicani;;;;;;sea;;;;;;drowning;;;;;Eldest of the sisters, Medusa alone stood the guardian of the Eastern gates of Sicani by the lapping sea. With unblinking gaze, she watched against the rising of the sun and the tides of invaders that sought to take the wide olive groves of Sicani for themselves. Her sister, Euryale, guarded the western gate with brazen hands and fearsome cries. The people of the city stood with her there. They held their shields together as impenetrable scales under her guidance. Stheno, the youngest, the softest of aspect, hers was to face the mountainous north with its crags and eagles' reach. With her yellow wings, she often flew to perch there. The great eagles and the seahawks, they flocked to her and took the flesh of the sea from her brazen hands.  The sea that lapped upon the harbor, they did not guard against. Were they not the daughters of the chthonic sea? They were the daughters of Phycys and Ceto coiled down far into the deep. They were the daughters of wine deep darkness and salt and echoes.  Medusa was in love.   She did not show it easily. That was not her nature. Her nature was unblinking. Her nature was the strong slide of great coils through the rolling hills bestrewn in ancient olive groves.   In the springtime of the year, when the yellow pollen fell from the trees, she first looked out from the Eastern gate and met the gaze of grey-eyed Athena. She, the daughter of a younger god, whose father consumed her mother in a single swallow. His monstrous aspect hidden between red smacking lips and a golden beard.  Medusa, she was unafraid. She strode out from her gate. Her spear in her hand. She pushed back the frozen mask of her helm, the bronze of it an eternal scream of righteous rage. The pollen fell golden upon her face. It trembled upon her lashes. Her bronze hair tumbled free. It alone indicated the tumbled nature of her feelings in that moment. That golden hour when she first met the gaze of grey-eyed Athena, wise as a serpent and contained too in her aspect.  They gazed into each other on that morning.   It would be imprudent to describe then what occurred between them. What happened when the eldest of the Gorgon sisters and Pallas Athena first met. It would be best to then say that Medusa opened her gates to Athena and let her into the city to dwell there.   On the highest hill within the polis, Medusa built for Athena a temple with wide open doors. That all might come in and find wisdom.  In the temple of Athena, they were often together. Athena at her loom, as Medusa watched her clever hands at their weaving. It was their home. They met with Euryale and shared bread drizzled with olive oil. They met with Stheno and played games.   They were in love. They pleated their fingers as one might weave the threads in a loom. They played at games together.   It would be imprudent to say more and yet, who writes with prudence that tells the tales of gods?  The kisses of their lips were as rich and golden as an olive oil of first press. Not virgin sisters kisses these, no. Medusa was a daughter of the chthonic sea. She kissed as fiercely. Athena, whose first words were a battle cry, she gave nothing way, but willing battled for Medusa's regard. Athena was the goddess of craft and arts and skill. Her fingers were clever. She crafted such things as to give her love delight. Athena greatly loved to rest her clever head upon the wild bronze masses of Medusa's hair and speak the names of clouds as they lay upon the flat roof of the temple. Medusa greatly loved to pay tribute to Athena and hold her tightly wrapped in her coils. They delighted in each other.   They were in love.   The lapping sea brushed against the sea steps that led down into the water. It was summer and all was blessed in the world. The olives grew round and ripe in the ancient olive groves that stretched into the rolling hills of the East.  In autumn of the year, the people of Sicani plucked the olives and took in the harvest. They fortified the walls of their homes. They painted the doors blue against the winter winds.  The lapping sea surged in its tides against the port of Sicani. It rose and fell. The boats of the fishermen rose and fell with it.  The wintertime came. With it the storms of grey skies and rain. In sorrowing aspect, Athena left for a journey to spend the shortest days with her father on high Olympus. That there might be some wisdom there.  They parted with sorrowing hearts and hopeful fingers.   Medusa was unafraid. Stheno mourned the loss of long days of flying in blue skies. Euryale used this time in training with the people. But Medusa reveled in the rain. She walked down the sea steps and she swam in the sea. Was it not her mother? Was it not her father?  Alas, Medusa had forgotten it was no longer chthonic days. There then her crime. To forget and for an instant close her eyes against the salt of the sea.  For in that winter storm, Poseidon looked upon her with her clouds of bronze hair floating in the fierce waves and found her beautiful. As she slithered back up onto the sea steps, he called to her and offered all the bounty of the sea if she would lie with him, but once. Her aspect was unchanged. She looked at him with unblinking blue-green eyes and picked up her spear in answer.  She forgot. What is a spear against the sea?  The waves roared. They crashed upon the harbor. There was no sea wall. The waves rushed past. They flooded the streets. Salt water poured past the doors painted blue. Whole families drowned. Grandmothers clutching at the plump legs of the babe just born. Euryale did what she could. She gathered her soldiers and led the people to the higher ground. Stheno battered as well she could against the wind and led them to the high passes in the mountains.  Medusa, she remained. She alone was the guardian of the Eastern gates.  But this was the sea. She fell back higher and higher within the emptied city. Poseidon pursued her. She cast her spear and the waves parted before it. She climbed the steps to the temple of Athena. She went into the temple with wide open doors that all might come in and find wisdom there.  It would be cruel to speak of what occurred there on the floor of the temple of Athena. What occurred on the marble that Medusa herself had carved for her love. The sea desired. The sea took. When the waters finally receded, buildings had been thrown from their moorings. Ships lay tilted upon the flat roofs where the people had gathered in halcyon days.  And the dead. There were so many dead.   Medusa screamed. She was rage personified.   She thrashed with her coils. She did as much damage then as the sea had done. Her screams were unending. She wrent the sky with them.  In the mountains above, Euryale wept. Stheno hid her face behind her wings. The Sicani cried out in fear.   The sisters parted from them then. They went to their sister, but Medusa could not be comforted.   Athena returned.   Tears poured down her stalwart cheeks. But Athena could only be the goddess that she was. She spoke of temperance and strategy and appeals to the law of Olympus. The blue-green gaze of Medusa met grey-eyed Athena then. She asked then what of the law for Metis? What of Athena's mother, consumed by her father, the young king of the gods. This was the rule of law. She did not say these words. She shouted them as she crashed her mighty coils. Athena gave her then the only comfort that she could.  Medusa's aspect, she changed to the face of her bronze helm. An eternal scream that her voice might rest. Her bronze curls that she had so loved, that had so drawn the sea lapping softly at the sea steps, she transformed into venomous serpents that none might trifle with her again. Her eyes, the eyes of the daughter of a chthonic sea, she made as stone and to look them was to become stone. Even the sea. Even the ever changing sea would be stone were it to look therein.  She might have then have waited. But for all her wisdom, Athena was a child of a younger god. Medusa bid her leave and Athena left. Her love grew gravid with the children the sea had forced upon her that day. She would not let fall from her body. She kept them inside herself. She ripped up the ancient olive groves. She destroyed the temple. She destroyed the city. Until even Euryale and Stheno were forced to make way from the city that was polis no more. Only the dead lived there.   Only statues of heroes that sought to slay the monster that dwelt there. They wanted the treasure of Siciani. The golden casks of olive oil transmuted by time and legend into boxes of gold.   There was no treasure. The olive oil had long since gone rancid on the touch of the sea.  Athena in time grew wiser then. It is not prudent to speak of the gods being unwise. But even the most clever can grow in wisdom. What were the thoughts of the goddess of craft and skill and defense when she sent Perseus with a shield as bright as a mirror to her love? It cannot be known.  But thereafter upon the shield of grey-eyed Athena, wise as a serpent, she bore the face of Medusa in her eternal rage. A goddess of wisdom may not be inclined to forgetfulness. She may also consider that in the end, even gods may die and the sea may turn to stone.;;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

50519623;;;;;Cassandra;;;;;;Ajax;;;;;;killed;;;;;" Outside, there was blood everywhere.     Bronze struck on bronze,     the last screams of fallen men filled the air.     And the women--still huddled in the temples,     safe for now, until their children's cries would betray     their hiding-places to the Greeks.       Few know it, but none forget it:     The smell of the burning city and     the sizzling flesh of those trapped in their houses.     My home, my Troy was afire.     Soon it would all be blacker with ash than    the earth that was with the blood of the fallen.       Inside the temple, I clung     to the cold statue of Athena,     praying for her protection from the deceitful,     merciless Greeks.     I knew what my future held;     I had known since Apollo had given me     foresight when I was younger.     I still hoped that what I had seen was untrue.     I would not resign myself to that future.     I would fight.    I kept my head bowed,     touching it to the statue's marble feet.       As I implored the goddess' aid,     I heard a man's heavy footsteps echoing     throughout that marble-walled room.     I turned to see a giant marching towards me.     I clutched the statue harder,     hoping that the more my hands hurt in doing so,     that the whiter my knuckles became,     the farther away that giant would be.        I plead faster and faster,    my words becoming an endless exhalation of prayer.     I wrapped my arms around Athena's white legs,     begging for her to shield me from the man approaching me.     But then I felt his sweat-slick hands tearing at my dress       I screamed as Ajax tore at my dress     with his bloody, sweaty hands.     I tried to squirm away, in vain.       He pinned me down.     My heart raced.     There is still time    Before the inevitable.        I held fast to the cold statue,     if I clutched Athena's likeness,     she would protect me.        Who would defile a priestess     in her own temple     in her most loyal city,     Supplicant at her feet?        He did.    As my arms were extended over my head,     my hands grasping Athena's feet,     Ajax's hands fumbled    The statue was cold.     He was hot, burning heat.        I refused Apollo,     Who cursed me for refusing him.     He didn't force me, but the choice he    Offered was no choice.     Rape or a curse?        In the end, it was both.       I shut my eyes,     I left my body behind,     And tried to remember the city    That would soon be gone.        Troy was a dream.     It was the gateway to the east,     and the city was resplendent with riches.    Trade ships bobbed in the azure water     of the harbor, the sun beating down on their     treasure-laden decks.        The Greek ships would soon be     Laden with us, the women.       The ships were our power.     The waters were ours,     we controlled the Hellespont,     the gateway between one great sea and another.        This was what the Greeks wanted,     The woman was an excuse.        Our palaces and temples of marble and stone     made them envious,     sun-gleaming buildings mocking     them with their brilliance.       Now they shimmered in flame    As they burned.        It is my wedding march,     The torches light the way    For now I become the bride    Of wrath.       I am gone, I am not here    Cassandra died on Athena's altar.    Tell them Ajax killed her.     For the woman who rises,     When he is done,     Is not her.     She has become    The flame.     ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
56631334;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" They looked towards me like I was a monster. A broken and twisted face of horror that walked among the people and gods plucking life from those who stood too close. Eyeing me up and down trying to figure out how my scars wrapped around my body like vines with blossoming roses rather than ugly reminders of what I had done. I glared back to the console. Three kings, the youngest and ruler of the sea, frozen in his seat pondering if he should agree with his brother, the middle, king of all and destined to punish me to my death, the eldest yet forgotten, eyeing me with indifference that shielded a pestering love. I was to be judged for the crimes I've committed among the mortals in the yesteryears of my immortal youth.     ""Kore,"" Zeus's voice boomed through the grand temple. He always had to be so loud, demanding attention from budding insecurities that lay in the pits of his mind.  I shifted my eyes towards him and peeked through the wet and tangled kinks of my hair. I could sense how uneasy he was with the heaviness of my eyes boring holes into his. I said nothing, keeping myself as eerie and untamed as he knew me best.     He began to talk. Saying something of the other and gesturing to the room around us. I didn't care, I couldn't, these insufferable gods and goddesses knew nothing of compassion and emptiness as I did. They knew nothing of what it meant to be born with the heart of a mortal that was decomposing from within. I felt an ache ripple through my chest and I moved a hand up to grip my dress. Zeus noticed and paused his speech to look me over before continuing.     ""Kore, your action upon the mortals has caused more damage to not only Gaia but also to Olympia. You've roamed far enough and left nothing but trails of bodies in your wake. You started small with the crops of the Earth, then to the livestock of all elements, to the bodies of people, you've managed to bring forth the wake of an armageddon."" Zeus sounded utterly disappointed. Like a father who purposefully forced his child to grow up in a cage. It was an act. Zeus had more to lose with the mortals below us than his authoritative dictatorship disappointment towards my hubris behaviour. His ego, his id, and his self.    ""You've put us all in danger,"" Zeus said. The lighting that circled his head like a halo came to life and the crack of thunder whipped as he dragged out the word danger. The lighting rippled down to his fingertips as he raised a sharp finger toward me. Another ache shot through like burning ice and I finally fell to my knees in a weakened gasp. The others around me began to murmur. My mother shot to her feet, wings spreading wide, knocking into those next to her as she flew down from her throne and pulled me in close.    ""Silence!"" Zeus commanded and all sound around vanished. My mother held me tighter as if she was scared. She was never scared. She couldn't be scared. She created me. I closed my eyes and leaned into my mother's warmth, a chilling cold crept down my body and she was the only hope I had of feeling safe.    ""Zeus!"" Demeter yelled. ""She is dying! A Goddess is dying!"" ";;;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
39728892;;;;;narrator;;;;;;none;;;;;;death;;;;;"     Before the Trojan war, but after Aphrodite and her lost love, Adonis, there was me. Luctus Sine Lumen. I have never found a place to belong with people, I reside far outside of Athens, along the edge of the woods near an eerie lake and a field of flowers. At this time I am about 22, My parents had never really been around. My mother left when I was young, and my father drank all the time so, I found my interest in painting and sculpting by the age of six.         No one ever seemed to really want to see my paintings, but I think they're pretty good. I never had any friends- ok well I had one. Adrina, but she was busy taking care of her new family- so I usually just talk to the gods. When my father was around, he told me to never depend on Aphrodite. He told me over and over again that she was good-for-nothing and claimed that love was a facade for fools that are enamored by others. My entire life, my father had belittled the goddess of love, and the idea of it in overall- since, of course, he had been left by his own love. Not that I care of course, I never really paid him any attention, but even then, i still don't really trust the idea of love. I've had crushes of course, but I've never confessed, or dated anyone, or gotten married. I've just been by myself.            My heart has always been in my sculptures and paintings. Never on people. When I was painting, my brush ran over my canvas several times again and again, until it was obvious that I was painting a woman. It was Aphrodite. I had no idea why I suddenly wanted to pay tribute to the goddess in such a manner, but I did so anyway. I suppose I had a childish idea of hope for true love. I spent days painting this woman. Her beauty in the painting was of course- unmatched, and she was watching. The gods could hear someone's prayers to them, their deepest desires, and even if i wasn't aware in the moment, there was the wish in the back of my mind that I would fall in love- maybe to someone as beautiful as the people in my portraits.                Aphrodite took great pleasure and pride in seeing such an act of devotion to her- even if I've never had the opportunity to go and rightfully pray in any of her temples, I still spent a very long time depicting someone of enormous perfection that looked similarly to the goddess. Because of this action, Aphrodite, who was of a great ego, felt the need to grant a wish of mine, and since I had longed deep down to feel what it is to be truly loved, she was going to prove she capable of granting such a desire.               Aphrodite had decided what she was going   to do for me so, she waited, and watched me for a while, catching all of my small comments about how i liked the different outcomes of different pieces. At one point, I had been sculpting the figure of a man, out of clay and rock. The goddess could hear all of my comments-- much to my dismay. Ones about how gorgeous this man was compared to all of the rest of humanity. It was then that she planned it out. On the first day of detailing this man, she would give the sculpture personality, on the second, compassion, the third, a brain, on the fourth, she gave him desire and love for his sculptor, on the very last day that I had worked on the sculpture, when I completed it, the goddess would give the statue life.             I threw myself forward slightly, just enough to wrap my arms around the sculpture. I had sat there for a while, until I felt the warmth of another's skin against my own, and until I felt the pressure of someone else's arms snaking around me. It's as if you can feel how genuine someone is by how they hug- how tightly, how long, and by what they say to you in such a situation. In this instance, what was said by him would stay with me for an eternity, long after I pass on.          ""I can see you...""               I took a minute, but when I finally let my eyes drift upwards, to see who was hugging me, my breath staggered a little and the corners my lips tugged hesitantly into a smile as my glossy, teary eyes swiftly cleared up. There I saw eyes of a deep green color- like jade stones. My eyes scanned around. I cant believe I didn't recognize him immediately. I designed him. The sharp jawline and the shape of this perfect nose belonged to my statue. I gasped and reached my hands up to touch the man's face. He was given life from Aphrodite,and he would from now on, only live for his sculptor. Always. Forever. I was speechless, but I could see the man's eyes looking at me, and then the creation spoke again,          ""You're...gorgeous""             I've never heard such a thing said to me before- under any circumstances at all ever- especially not by a man I sculpted and spent over a week to perfect....or by a man at all. My mouth opened slightly and I tried to stand myself up, earning the assistance of the other man. Once we were both stood up, I sort of regretted making him so muscular and tall. Outside the window were two crows. To avoid awkward eye contact, for a moment, I just stared out at the birds- watching as another bird joined, the three birds stood in the grass for quite a bit before two of them left, leaving one by itself in the field. After a few seconds of that, I turned back to the stranger, having worked up the courage to speak.         ""Do you have a name?"" I spoke in a little bit more of a hushed voice than the other man did-but even so, it was loud enough to hear         ""Aphrodite called me 'Novellus"""" the other responded. Novellus was a name that suited this man quite well- In my opinion at least.         ""Novellus. It is perfect. My name is Luctus. Luctus Sine Lumen"" I answered the taller man immediately.              After we introduced ourselves, I allowed Novellus to stay in my house with me. We often picked fruits together, Nove had often tossed apples towards me, which I thought was rather odd, since no apple trees grow around us, but I chose not to think on it too much. As months went by, I fell in love with the 'son' of Aphrodite, just as the goddess herself intended. Everything went perfectly. Novellus adjusted to life as a human man and learned how to pick up on social cues. He took care of me every single day. In the winters, he would hardly leave my side. Seasons passed, and we both resided in our little home in the forest, selling some of the artwork to some locals in the town, and laying on the forest's soft grass base to watch the stars and the clouds each day. We loved each other, and always would until the end of time, and as for Novellus, he told me he would see me each and every day, until he couldn't. Even if he were going blind, he would never wish to look upon anything but me, which was far more than I ever could have asked for.    This is meant to be a short story. So there will be some time skips in this chapter.       within the year after I created him, he stayed with me. He refused to leave my side, and I don't think I wanted him to. I would say things like, ""Follow me. We are going to go pick up some foods from the city"" or maybe some days I would ask him to come with me to pick flowers and care for the wildlife and always.  Always  he would do it. He always went with me. That man is the best thing that has ever happened to me and everyday, I thank Aphrodite for granting him to me.            A year or two after that, things were great, but the fourth year after I created him, a war between the cities began. The Trojan war. It was horrible. Me and Novellus stayed in the countryside. We avoided the war, and the blood and gore as best we could. Nothing was worse than going into town and seeing men being carried into their homes, returning from the battlefield wounded or even dead. Blood dropped from their bodies as if it was water. It became so normal after a while, but people never stopped screaming. Their screams still ring in my ears sometimes. The children were always the worst to oversee. They cried. More than I thought was possible for any living thing. I felt sort of guilty- because I never had to worry about losing my lover. He was immortal. I don't think I could handle it if I lost him.            Months passed and it was fine- although the animals began to act weird. But only around our home. Plants started dying and we had to go further and further every time we needed to get some. It must be Artemis who has decided to cause havoc in the forest. It was well known that Aphrodite hated her because their beliefs were far different- as a result, she often killed Artemis' followers or made them fall in love, but I don't know why she would want anything to do with me or Novellus.            This went on for a very long time and the war got closer and closer to the town, and forest in which we resided. Novellus constantly offered to go and fight them off- to keep our home safe and protect me- but that was unnecessary. He insisted every day that he should go help fight the war. I was somewhat worried what that kind of experience would do to him. I knew he was immortal but an immortal life is not worth living if you are haunted by the lives you have taken.        ""My dove, let me go help the town fight. I cant die, you know that.""       ""I know, Nove, but I know what war does to people, and it's not worth it.""        ""Well then let me go aid the wounded""            I agreed to this idea because I know how desperately he wanted to help. It was torture to have to just stay on the side and watch people die and families mourn. He went to go help the injured every day he could, but the war drew closer. He left one morning a little earlier than usual to go help and I went into the other side of town to give some of the folks the plants I found deep in the gardens we grew, since our closer ones were dying. I liked to listen to the townspeople gossip as well. It was usually very interesting to hear but this time, it was anything but.        ""Did you hear? One of those woodland boys went to fight in the war""       I immediately stopped. My head turned like the shadow of a sundial.        ""What?""            When I spoke, I thought i sounded fine, but the lady I had said it to- the way she reacted seemed like she was looking at a child who burst into tears. She looked at me with such regret.        ""Oh wait! You're that boy! One of the ones from the fore-"" I cut her off.        ""What did you just say...""       ""I- uhh...did you not know? Your friend...he left for the war a few hours ago""           The way I stared at her must have made her feel some sort of sympathy because she looked like she wanted to rub my shoulder like distant relative would when they see you for the first time in a year.        ""What are you talking about?"" I responded sharply. My slight anger that he disobeyed me immediately changed to pure worry.        ""Well the war came closer to the woods first, and when he overheard that he immediately left towards it.""           There was such a mix of emotions I was feeling, and so many thoughts in my head that I couldn't hear what she was saying after that- I had tuned everything out. I wasn't in control of my body anymore. I blinked and I was running back home. I tripped over my own feet plenty of times and stumbled more than I could count. I couldn't see anymore. It was all so blurry and my face was wet. I was crying. Not crying. Sobbing. I made it to the field before the forest and already there were plenty of the dead. I ran there and I didn't see any living soldiers, only dead ones. Some from our army and some from the other's. When I tripped for the last time, it hurt to get up.            I glanced up from my spot on the ground and I saw him. He was knelt on the ground in front of the creek. The water ran red with blood. A doe was laying dead in the water. It was obvious the soldiers had no mercy for the animals. I tried to pick myself up and I managed to make it right next to him. He was frozen. He stared at the water and his hands were shaking.        ""Nove?""    ""Novellus!""             I shouted a bit as I shook him but he didn't respond. I turned and looked around as grabbed his hand and held it tightly. I could see the house was a mess, the door was broken and things had been shattered. The wildlife was almost all gone. I knew the doe that was in the creek, I knew half of these soldiers that were bleeding out onto the grass- painting it a shade of crimson.            I tried to get Novellus to get up and come inside with me- I even tried to take him to the town but he didn't move. After that, I gave up. I let my hand caress his left cheek and I wiped the blood off of his face, then the water was used to clean his hands. I cleaned his smooth skin of the blood and regret, but I knew he would be different after this. That's when I heard shouting. People shouting. More soldiers.            This bit was mostly blurry. One of the men tried to pull me away from him, but I screamed and cried and remained next to him. He was alive. I could feel his hand gripping mine, but he wasn't completely conscious. I pushed the soldier over and managed to knock him out. I tried once again to pull him. The only thing that left my mouth were soft mumbles and cries.       ""Novellus...please. You have to get up. Please.""            At that point I was on my feet, pulling at his arm- and then I wasn't. I felt a sharp pain in my gut and I fell to my knees again. I touched my stomach and it was blood. I was bleeding. Behind me was a soldier who had just removed his sword, freshly coated in my blood. I couldn't really speak- I just made incoherent soft whimpers and gasps of pain. It hurt. It hurt so bad.            That was when he turned around. He was finally conscious again, as I was being dragged by one of my arms, across the grass. There were about 3 soldiers there now. Novellus immediately grabbed the sword that had been next to him and sliced one of them completely in half, the second one was decapitated, and the last one, he stabbed him- in the same way I was stabbed. He knelt by my side and I cried softly.            My love tried to quiet me and calm me. He whispered and held me in his arms. I could tell he was panicked and manic. I paused after a while and winced. I nearly forgot I was bleeding. The only thing I could do was watch his face. His beautiful face. I could tell he knew I was in pain. He knew I was dying. But he refused to believe it.        ""Nove...""        ""No- shhh stop. Don't say anything- you're going to be fine.""            I held his cheek with as much strength as I could get and I pulled his face to mine. We were covered in dirt, blood and sweat. Our foreheads met and both of our eyes shut.            I heard him cry. I did not speak to him but I opened my eyes and pressed a kiss onto his lips and cried with him. There is a saying I've heard before. Est quaedam flere voluptas which translates to- there is a certain pleasure in weeping. there is.        ""You don't have to follow me this time, Nove""            After I spoke that he seemed to weep harder and hold me tighter. I couldn't really hear him. But he was speaking. It all became fuzzy.            I bleed the blood of man. I know this because i have seen it. I did not think I would belong in this world like others do, so I tried to leave. I am not an immortal creation of the gods like he is. I designed him and the gods granted my most valued wish. I worry what he will do when I've gone from here.             I'm sorry, my love- I know you will be upset with me, and then with the gods that created you. I am not meant to live forever, and you are not meant to die forever.                                 Last chapter Les gooooo       Even though I was gone, I still felt him holding me. When I died, I was allowed by the gods to watch over him for a while, though once I passed on, or given a new life, I would forget what I saw in these moments, there was so much I wanted to say.            He held my body for the longest time, while he wept. I've never seen him cry before. He screamed. He shouted for his mother, the one who gave him life- Aphrodite. He told her to bring me back, and then he begged her to end his life.            Aphrodite rarely ever answered wishes in person. But she stepped out into the forest from behind a tree. Near her, there was a Stag. She raised her arm and the deer approached the creek and sat. Everyone in the forest was in mourning.            The goddess then walked towards Novellus. She held his face with a gentle hand- like a motherly touch. Here, he begged her again, to kill him...to which she refused. He cried and didn't stop hugging my body.        ""Please mother!""            The man raised his hand and placed his palm over Aphrodite's hand that was on his face. She seemed empathetic.       ""You are not alone in your anguish, child, but a bitter heart eats its owner.""            Everyone knew about Aphrodite's experience with heartbreak and grief because of what happened to Adonis, but in this moment, he, of course was thinking selfishly. The ones who weep always claim no one knows how they feel, but she knows how you feel, beloved- I know how you feel.            I was reincarnated a few times and had some good lives but I never saw him again. There was not a single moment I didn't wish to somehow come across him and stay with him forever. It's the most painful when you remember everything. When you remember what his voice sounds like and how his hands felt holding you. I'm always going to try and go back to him. Every single time.           Dum Spiro Spero   ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
52941766;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Here's a collection of random Greek (and probably Norse and Egyptian myths) re-told mostly from memory by me! Enjoy!   Well, one day Zeus (the cheater himself) fell in love with a woman named Alcmene and decided, ""Hey, I'd love to get in her pants"" but she was already married to Amphitryon which made Zeus second guess cause he'd never cheat with a married woman (cue hera screaming in the distance), but then Zeus being Zeus decided to just shape shift into her husband and do the deed with her that way, so he bribed the sun god (either Helios or Apollo I've seen versions that say either) to make the night last for an abnormally long time so he could get away with his plan.  Amphitryon came home the next morning, much to the confusion of of Alcmene (they figured out it was Zeus, I forget how but they do). Then fast forward 9 months and Alcmene had to twins, but only one was a demi-god (somehow), Iphicles and some name I can't remember (it gets changed so it doesn't matter). But the fact that one was a child of Zeus made Alcmene nervous that she and or her child who get smite by Hera, so what did she do? Abandon her new born child in a field obviously. But Zeus (Or Athena, depending on what version you read) took him to Hera, and was like, ""Hey I found some random child in a field whos name is....uh, Heracles! You know, meaning glory to Hera! haha"". So Hera decided to nurse him out of pity, (suck up lol). But Heracles apparently bit her so she pushed him away and accidently created the milky way.  Hera's goddess milk made him a buff baby then Zeus was like, ""Lol, ok bye, I totally won't cheat on you again"" and brought Heracles back to his mother (You know, the one that abandoned him in a field). But they decided to not abandon him in a field this time and instead raise him, but Hera then realized he was a child of one of her husbands many many many (times like 100) affairs so she decided to try and kill him with 2 random snakes she sent after him but because Heracles was now a buff baby he snapped both there necks and strangled them.  *time skip to when he's no longer a buff baby but a buff teenager/man*  Heracles ended up growing up a pretty normal child, (Unless you count that one time he murdered his music teacher on accident) and married Megara the princess of Thebes (After stopping Thebes from being attacked) until Hera decided ""You know, I haven't been tried to kill or ruin that kids life in a long time, I think it's about time I did that"" and drove him insane causing him to....murder his wife and children with his superhuman strength in a fit of rage...(Like, Hera we know you hate him but that was a bit much).  Then when Hera's inanity magic wore off Heracles freaked out and went to ask the oracle of Delphi how he could make up for his actions, (tbh, I think you're the one who deserved an apology my dude, Zeus and Hera need some serious marriage consoling). The oracle told him to go do what ever 10 things his cousin asked of him for 12 years, then they'd make him a god, (Hera - It was at this moment that she knew, she fucked up). So he traveled to visit Eurystheus (that's his cousin btw), though he didn't want to help his cousin he also wasn't inserted in getting smited by his dad so he went along with it. (Btw, his cousin is on Hera's side during all this cause he too was  p e t t y )  So his asshole cousin was like, ""Hey dude, so you now how you're for some reason in-debt to me cause you commited some homicide? Well I want you to go slay the Neiman lion because of it"" (he didn't think he'd pull it off). So Heracles went to find and fight the Neiman lion so he could bring it's corpse to his weird ass cousin who diffidently wants him dead. (Also he met this boy who was like, ""You kill that lion and we'll sacrifice one to Zeus but if you die or chicken out, I get sacrificed to Zeus!"" so ig some random town sacrificed a lion to Zeus then). When he found the lion and realized he couldn't shoot it cause it was immune to all weapons he made a plan and strangled it while it slept pretty much. Then returned to his cousin with the dead lion to be assigned his next task.  This feat made Heracles even more popular and his cousin more jealous (again, petty bitch). So for his next task his cousin told him to kill the Hyrda, so Heracles hopped a ride with this nephew Iolas (I assume on the godly side cause none of them can keep it in there pants) to go to the swamp where the Hyrda lived and kill the it. He figured out that if you cut off one of the Hyrda's head it would simply re-grow (also I think he got attacked by some crab mid fight which is just, random af) it so Iolas helped him make a plan where they would cut of all it's heads then burn the necks so more heads wouldn't grow back and used it's poison blood to make poisons arrows (that'll be important later). But when he returned to his cousin (the petty one), he refused to count this task as one of his 10 labors cause he had helps from Iolas (like I said, petty bitch) so now he had to do 11 labors to make up for this one not counting.  The next thing he got forced into doing (this was Hera's idea btw) was capturing this magic deer called the ceryneian hind but it was really hard to catch cause it could run super fast, and he couldn't shoot it because it was again, hella fast. So, he just chased it around for a year but one night he found it sleeping and captured it (versions may very). His cousin was hoping Heracles doing this would piss of Artemis cause he captured her sacred animal and there for would smite him or something, and when Heracles was bringing the hind to his petty cousin Artemis (and in some versions Apollo) showed up to give him a what for, (you can hear Hera and Eurystheus laughing in the distance) but after Heracles explained the situation Artemis aloud him to take it as long as he set it after, but his cousin made him give it to some king so he gave it to the king outside and the deer just ran away, once again fouling his idiot cousins plans.  After that fiasco his cousin sent him to go deal with this murder boar and was causing a lot of problems for people. So on his way to do that he had dinner with this centaur who's name I can't remember rn and was like, ""Hey, so wanna share some wine?"" to which the centaur was like, ""Well...the only wine I have was a gift from Dionysus and doesn't just belong to me but sure ig"" but then all the other centaurs showed up, got drunk and well....  *One large account of unnecessary centaur murder later*  The only one he spared was the centaur he had dinner with but then the centaur dropped a poison arrow on his foot and died (skill issue lol). Heracles then visited Chiron (some versions say he got shot too) who told him how to catch the angry death boar. He was told to shove the boar into thick snow so Heracles did, then returned to his asshole cousin with the boar. The next thing his cousin sent him to do was clean the augean stables in one day (they hadn't been cleaned in over 30 years and 1,000's of animals lived there btw). He managed to clean the stables by seducing a nyad (water nymph) and diverting the river to wash they stables clean, (which like, way to poison and entire ecosystem cause you happened to be horny and needed to clean some shit). After that he asked to be paid by the stable owner who refused but bitchy mcbitch face (his cousin) decided to use this as a way to make the labor not count meaning he had to do another to make up for it bringing his number of labors to 12.  After that his cousin decided to task him with several counts of harassing random wildlife which included, stymphalian birds, a very pissed off creatan bull and a bunch of flesh eating horses, the mares of Diomedes. Then in-between his 8th and 9th labor he did some more cool stuff like, murder another centaur, invent the olympics, fight some giants, sailed around on the argo with Jason and rescue Prometheus from the eagle that was constantly eating his liver. You know, all very chill stuff, (you can imagine all this pissed of Hera and Eurystheus weren't very happy about this). So, due to Hera and Eurystheus being extra pissed off after all that they sent him to steal a belt from a bunch of super badass female warriors (the amazons). (Also some people think Theseus was here for all this) He ended up just talking to them and getting the belt though so Hera felt the need to intervene by shapeshifting into one of the amazons, (And we say holding grudges is a fatal flaw associated with hades?!) and was like, ""Hey, my husbands bastard child is here to kidnap the queen of the amazons we should totally kill him"", then.....  *One very unnecessary massacre of some super badass warriors later (Thanks a lot Hera)*  He then returned to his cousin and got send on his 10th labor to collect the cattle of geryon, (why he wanted them idk). On the way there though he got pissed off about heat stroke and attempted to fight the sun and shot an arrow at it. This prompted (either Helios or Apollo take your pick) to come deal with the situation and was impressed by Heracles sheer audacity and gifted him a magic cup that he could ride in to make his journey easier, (Hear that kids? Shoot the sun and you'll get a magic cup out of it). So when he go to the island with the cows he fought a three bodied giant, a son of ares (I think) and a 2 headed dog. Then he shoved all the cows into his magic cup from the sun god but on the way back one got loose so Heracles had to fight some dude names Eryx to get the cow back. After that Hera, being the petty bitch she is somehow scared all the cows away with a fly, (I didn't know cows where scared of flies). So after Heracles rounded them all up he finally made it back to his cousin just so he could kill them all in honor of Hera.  Then with his first 10 tasks complete he had to complete 2 extras because his cousins and asshole. So, he got sent to go collect a golden apple from the hesperides tree. So he went to capture some shapeshifting sea god to reveal the location of the tree to him then according to some versions of the myth he suspended a child of Gaia in the sky and hugged him to death (Also he almost got sacrificed in Egypt by some king). But Heracles didn't want to do this labor himself (somehow it still counted though??? I think his douchebag cousin was just getting lazy tbh) so he went a tricked the titan Atlas into collecting the apples for him while he held up the sky in Atlas's place. When Atlas came back with the apples and offered to take them back himself Heracles said he needed to adjust his outfit and convinced Atlas to take back the sky (the flipping idiot).  And finally, for his 12th and final labor his cousin sent him to retrieve Cerberus from the underworld (Pretty blunt about trying to get him killed my dude) so Heracles traveled to the underworld and found 2 people with there asses glued to rocks for all eternity (pretty sure it was for trying to kidnap Persephone but I don't remember) and freed one of them before getting scared off by a mini earthquake and made his way to Hades to ask permission to take his dog, (Fun fact, Cerberus pretty much translate to Spot so Hades, god of the underworld named his dog spot <3). Hades agreed as long as Heracles returned him unharmed, (and people think Hades is a villain, smh) so Heracles took Cerberus to his cousin who finally announced he was redeemed of his sins and gave up trying to kill him. So, finally redeemed for the murder of his family he fought a river god and married a princess named Deinaeria and he was happy for a while. That is until a centaur Nesso's kidnapped his wife and tried to marry her, so Heracles shot him with an arrow and as he bled out he convinced Deinareria to take some of his blood and if Heracles was ever on faithful to her it would act as a love potion, (spoiler alert - it was poison). Then later Deinareria noticed Heracles was flirting with someone named Iole (Dude, your married you keep it in your pants unless it's with your wife please, you almost got murdered multiple times because your dad cheated after all). So, when she was doing laundry she rubbed the centaurs blood onto Heracles clothing, which inevitably poisoned him so what did he do? That's right, he set himself on fire. But Zeus saved him and offered him immortality (hera wasn't too happy about that) which he accepted. Then he married, Hebe the goddess of eternal youth and that's pretty much that for Heracles.  - The End   The myth of Orpheus and Eurydice  So, Orpheus was a child of the muse Calliope ( my phone keeps wanting to call her cantaloupe) and Apollo (I think some versions say it was some king too but idk I remember him being a child of Apollo), and because his dad was Apollo and his mom was the muse of poetry my dudes was a pretty sweet musician (for my fellow pjo fans, basically charm speak but with a lyre). He lived in Thrace and basically impressed everyone with his music. He was so good at music that he ended up part of the argonauts with Jason on his journey for some sick new drip (I'll probably talk about him more in his own myth later). Also he chilled in Egypt and learned about Dionysus cult worship for a while (well that's just ironic...)  Orpheus fell in love with Eurydice and married her but this dude at there wedding (the literal god of marriage Hymen, not to be confused with the goddess of marriage Hera...yeah not that bitch) was like, ""so yeah this happy marriage isn't gonna last very long my dudes"" and safe to say his was right. Euphoria was walking with her nymph friends in the forest and i guess no one taught her that rhyme ""red on black friend of Jack, black on yellow you're a dead fellow"" because boom, snake bite and she was dead.  So, Orpheus was obviously crushed by this loss and decided to go all emo and write super angsty music and stuff, but cause his music was magical and all that he started making everyone depressed so Apollo came to him and was like, ""dude you gotta stop making everyone sad, go return your wife from the underworld or something but please stop making everyone depressed and angsty with you"", so Orpheus traveled to the underworld to retrieve his wifey from the dead.  He went before Hades and Persephone (so this happened in winter or fall) and started playing his angsty emo music for them instead and it was so powerful it made everyone in the underworld sob, so Hades agreed to let Eurydice to travel back to the lane of the living with Orpheus but with the deal that Orpheus couldn't turn around to look at Eurydice until they were both out of the underground. Orpheus would have to lead Eurydice with his music but if Orpheus ever turned around to see Eurydice before they were in the mortal world she would be forced to return to the underworld.  They managed to make it all the way to the entrance when Orpheus feared he was being tricked by hades (hear that folks, Hades is a villain propaganda lost him his wife) and turned around only for his wife to be sent back to the underworld. After loosing his wife for a second time and returning to being angsty he decided to swear off relationships with woman and instead turned to pedophilia directed at young boys.....  Then, when he was having an angsty concert for the forest creatures bashing all the gods a bunch of Dionysus cult followers showed and ripped him limb from limb for not worshipping Dionysus (again, the irony). In death he was finally reunited with his dearly beloved Eurydice (imagine him having to explain his angsty pedophilia faze...that would definitely be awkward af). And his lyre became a constellation at one point too.   The myth of Hades and Persephone  So, I'm sure many people think of this story and go ""Oh HaDeS iS a BaD gUy! He KiDnApPeD hIs wIfE!""AND YEAH, HE DID KIDNAP HIS WIFE BUT JUST TAKE A SEAT AND CHILL PLEASE BECAUSE I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS HADES SLANDER!!! (Even if it's a bit deserved ;-;)  Anyways, Hades, god of the dead (Yes, the dead. Not death. The god of death is Thanatos, there's a difference.), was one of the big three brothers who helped defeat the titans.  Hades ruled the underworld and one day, he saw a very pretty goddess, Demeter's daughter, Persephone (In some versions she's called Kore, which means maiden. Side note, in the version I was told as a kid, he fell in love with her because she was the only one who wasn't afraid of Cerberus, which is just so adorable to me <3), and our bro started simping for her.  So, he went to Zeus (Persephone's father mind you) and was like, ""I wanna marry her, but I have social anxiety and don't know how to talk to hot people so wtf do I do?!"" to which Zeus, after thinking long and hard (note my sarcasm) was like, ""Uh, just kidnap her....that normally works for me"" (Also, in some versions Zeus arranged there marriage in the first place)  So, when Persephone (Or Kore, take your pick) was out picking flowers, Hades rode out from the underworld on his chariot and kidnapped her after she wandered off on her own (versions may very). But Demeter noticed her absence and was (rightfully) concerned for her daughter and went to the sun god Helios (the version I know, it was Helios so we're going with that for now, if you want you can say it's apollo) and Helios was like, ""Oh her? Yeah, Hades kidnapped her-"" (Cue distressed screaming from demeter)  Upon finding out her daughter was, you know, kidnapped she rightfully freaked out and Helios was like, ""Hey, Hades isn't the worst person to be stuck with, he's actually pretty cool, blah blah blah, misogyny is cool, blah blah-"" (Cue more angry Demeter noises)  (SIDE NOTE, Misogyny is most diffidently NOT COOL BROS! Ancient Greece was not very good to women, and the stories and myths of the time reflect that as a whole, I try to keep things light hearted but some myths, such as Medusa, have heavy themes of this or these themes still slip through. Ancient Greece was pretty fucked up so just know I try my best but the stories are still gonna reflect the time period in some aspects)  -Back to our scheduled programming-  Once Demeter had calmed down from her fit of rage (Justified rage to be fair), she decided her best course of action to fill the Persephone shaped hole in her heart was.....to dress up as an old lady named Doso and become a baby sitter for this kid, Demophoon (I imagine this kid has a fair helping of childhood trauma after this lol). But along with all the normally babysitter duties she also.... planned to make him immortal so she coated him in ambrosia, breathed on him and set him on her boobs and put him to bed in a fire at night to burn away his mortal spirit....(Someone's been hanging out with Hera a little to much lol). All without his parents knowing. But, one night when she put the baby to sleep in a fire (This kid and Leo Valdez can trauma bond over this lol) his mother walked in and rightfully...freaked out, interrupting the ritual and, in some versions, killing Demophoon. Though in others he survives his night in the fire, but dies later due to the weird half immortality thing he's got going on after this whole ordeal. (She also taught Demophoon's older brother to be a farmer after this and apparently my dude travels on a dragon-drawn chariot....so...)  But after the mothers freak out, Demeter gets upset and reveals herself to be a goddess and told Demophoon's parents, the only way she'd forgive them was if they built her a temple (I'd be so confused if I was the parents in this situation).  So, the parents built her a temple and Demeter chilled there instead of Olympus and became so depressed she forgot to make plants grow and caused this huge drought/famine.  And the rest of the gods started noting and where like, ""So, what the fuck is up with Demeter and why are we not getting sacrifices from the mortals anymore??""  So all the gods went to Demeter's little depression nest and tried to coax her back to Olympus or at the very least, get her to stop letting all the plants die, and they all failed. So Hermes decided to go knocking on Hades door to get some answer on Persephone and hopefully convince her to return to the mortal world so Demeter would stop being an angsty little bitch and killing all the mortals.  Persephone agreed to return with Hermes but before she left she ate 6 pomegranate seeds (In some versions I think they say it was 12 but I remember it as 6), and when she returned Demeter was finally happy again and decided she wasn't going to slowly end humanity with a lack of plants. However, because she ate the pomegranate seeds she had to stay in the underworld but Demeter and Hades got into an argument which I imagine went a little something like this,  ""If you eat food in the underworld you have to stay there!""  ""Oh really? Then how are you here?!""  *Cue awkward pause*  ""I don't count, but she ate 6 pomegranate seeds so she has to stay in the underworld with me!""  ""Well, she only had 6 seeds! Not a whole pomegranate so surely she can stay with me instead!""  *Lots of godly screaming, meanwhile Persephone and Hermes are just watching*  Hermes - ""So you see that race last weekended? It was pretty cool""  Persephone - ""Ah, no I missed it....was sort of kidnapped by my husband remember?""  ""Oh yeah, that sucks...""  ""Meh, he's got a dog though, I like dogs""  But anyways, they decided to take the matter to Zeus (Why him I'm not sure, like I know he's the king of the gods and all but...I feel like it would have made more sense for Athena to handle this one but maybe that's just me) who eventually decided that because she only ate 6 seeds, she only had to spend 6 months in the underworld. But, Demeter swore that she wouldn't let plants grow without Persephone being with her.  So now, 6 months of the year Demeter gets seasonal depression and stops making plants grow while Persephone vibes with a dog, her husband and a bunch of dead dudes for 6 months.  - The End   The myth of Pandora's box  Hey there! Remember what I said in the Hades and Persephone chapter about misogyny in ancient greece? Yeah, this might have a bit of that peaking through in parts so just, fair warning folks!  So, Pandora's box can basically be summed up as a myth explaining how people happened (least, according to the ancient greeks). Also, this and Hades and Persephone where the first greek myths I ever heard so I kinda have a soft spot for them lol.  But anyways, if we wanna start with how people happened (again, according to the ancient greeks) there were many trials and errors with creating people. When the tians where around, they created people which where actually not to bad or creepy (I will touch on the whole soulmate thing briefly here but I'll probably dedicate a chapter to it too if I'm up for it). But when Zeus took over (I'll go a chapter on the titan war at some point too) I guess he destroyed those people or something cause I can't find much about what happened to them (Then again, not entirely sure what I should be looking for in that regard so take this with a grain of salt).  The titan Prometheus (Some versions say he was a god I think? Idk, were just going with titan) could see the future, so before the whole titan war he and his brother, Epimetheus (he'll be important later), went into hiding so they didn't have to deal with it all. So when Zeus took over he created his own human race, though they sort of just stayed babies for a 100 years then died. So, he started over with a different batch of human which stayed babies for a lot less time that his first versions.  But, these humans where violent towards each other so Zeus refused to give them fire. But Prometheus gave them fire anyways, until Zeus found out he chained him to a rock and had an eagle eat his liver everyday for eternity until Heracles helped him out with it. But Zeus still wanted to punish people for having fire so he had Hephaestus create a woman named Pandora to be there punishment. (Again, misogyny is not cool folks!). The gods gifted her a dress, flowers for her hair, golden jewelry etc.  And, this is the part where the myth gets kinda fuzzy, in the kids book I had Pandora was given her box and then later her daughter was the one to open it but I don't think that version is very authentic considering it was a Max and Ruby picture book for kids so while it was the version I grew up with, I don't think it's the most accurate to the original myths.  But in some versions on the myth that I've heard she was given her box (Which was actually a storage jar in the original myths, but got changed to box threw translation errors) as one of her gifts from the gods. Prometheus (Remember him? yeah, well he can still see the future) told his brother that Zeus was going to try and arrange a marriage between Epimetheus and Pandora and then Pandora was going to unleash all her plagues and bad stuff out of the jar to screw over the entirety of humanity and that he probably shouldn't do marry her. But Epimetheus married her anyways and just like Prometheus had said she opened her box/jar and released all the evil stuff into the world (Except for hope, which I'm pretty sure stayed in the jar).  In other versions, Zeus left the jar/box in the care of Epimetheus (I think anyways) and Pandora grew curious and opened the box accidently releasing all the evil shit into the world but quickly closed it upon realizing what she did, leaving hope trapped in the jar. (Funnily enough, this isn't the first time opening jars or urns have been said to releasing bad stuff in greek myth, there's also references to it in the Iliad).  So now the mortals had to deal with sickness and famines and stuff, so Zeus decided ""Fuck it"" and started making a flood to whip them all out (I swear, gods all throughout different mythology and religions always resort to 'when in doubt, drown humanity', like this shows up so many times through old religions and mythologies I swear. Like, who started that? Who was the first god/goddess to drown humanity??).  But anyways, Prometheus keeps providing exposition to people despite his lack of a liver, so he goes to his son Deucalion and tells him Zeus is having his ""when in doubt, drown humanity"" moment so he should probably act accordingly and unlike Epimetheus, Deucalion actually decided to act accordingly by shoving himself and his wife, Pyrrha into a box so they could just vibes through Zeus's rain of terror (Literal rain of terror in this case).  So after basically vibing through Zeus's apocalypse it was sort up to them to re-populate the earth but instead of doing it the natural way they took the easy and lest incent-y (Big shocker there considering it's Greek Mythology) way to do so and just tossed some rocks around which Zeus turned into people. And this was finally the human race that stuck and didn't get wiped out (I mean, if 2020 is anything to go by there's been attempts to do so but we're, somehow, still standing!).  - The End ";;;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
48677368;;;;;the speaker;;;;;;the son;;;;;;killed;;;;;"I found myself becoming Menelaus. My husband tossed into a useless war, and then further, into unfriendly homes, taken in by wretched men and Gods. But never dead. Sing to me, Sacker of Cities, about a vagabond. He who was stolen by the sea, even as he trampled on the hearth of Troy, and his wife waited dutifully for his return. Always faithful. Always Penelope. One flesh, one bone, one heart, do you remember that I never loved you? No, I was you. Remember, roadless one, that the goddess of weaving is also my patron. I am also a liar.   I was queen Dido, I alone governed my kingdom, and we had never been more prosperous. Even the slaves ate well, and it was all due to my leadership.     It was noonday when you arrived, Aeneas, and your eyes glowed bright black, ensnaring me in the web your dutiful mother wove. Could you have not taken me without help?    I came to my senses after I died, of course, but you never did.You wanted me as your mistress even after I became a silent wraith.     I take some perverse happiness in knowing that your city too, will surely fall.      I was raped.     There, I've said it, the cat is out of the bag, the girl is out of Sparta, whatever you thought I did, you were wrong.     But did you really think it would be anything else? Paris was pretty, but he wasn't mine. None of them were, because you can't truly love a woman like you love gold.     That's what nobody seems to understand.     And what none of   you   seem to understand, not even after I'm dead and rotting in my grave, my dear suitors, is that I never chose to be beautiful. Give that role to Clytemnestra.    So I gave Helen to Paris. Okay, I'm a Goddess. What did you expect?     No,   I'm not every man's wish fulfillment wet dream given human form. Where on   earth   did you get that idea?     I'm the Goddess of sex, desire, and power. I stood over Ares with a sword on his chest when he propositioned me, and he knew I could leave him with a godly scar and it only excited him more. I stepped on his throat and he gagged and got hard underneath me.     So yes, I gave Helen to Paris. I'm a Goddess. What did you expect?    Can't we talk about something other than the various men we fucked?     No? I didn't think so. Those were the only unique things about our pitiful lives.     There's nothing I desperately want to say about Jason- He was a hero, I was forced to love him, he sailed away, he was a bad man. It's the gods I hate.     I never knew what lust was until they started meddling. Bodies disgusted me, I only wanted to tend to my herbs in peace. The Gods made my body desire Jason, but my mind revolted, even up until the day I died.     Stop making me a   victim.   God.     How many times do I have to say it to make it clear? He cried on the beach every night. I'm a god, and he was a mortal. Do the math. We women don't have to be the victims in every story, you know. Don't I get to follow my nature as a deity?    Does it make you uncomfortable that a woman could do that to a man instead of the other way around?    Make me a villain- it's the role I deserve. But do it right. I'm not just evil, I'm also powerful.        I bet you're wondering why I'm here. Or maybe you figured it out a long time ago, and you're simply laughing at my shame.     When did you get your doubts? Was it Pentheus? Ariadne? The Maenads? Or was it just my own sad nature?    I sometimes find myself becoming Aphrodite. Love, madness, beauty- it's all the same to me, it all leads to the same wild feast of tearing Orpheus into shreds. It's not in my nature to humiliate myself, but it's also not in my nature to be a man.     Now, what would you like to drink? Bourbon? Wine?     Dear father, I hope you die.    The people here are kind, and I wish I thought about you less than I do, but even now, you control the whole of Rome, reaching into parts of Egypt. Not the parts I'm in, I hope.     Your prodigal daughter, I would have gotten in the way of your godhood, bringing home both men and women with wild abandon.     I like to think you wouldn't have done this to me if you weren't Deus Romae,  but you would've. If you didn't have Agrippa, you could've saved some of your love to give to me.        I don't want to talk about it. Achilles and Agamemmnon, Chryses and the war and the plague. I was hidden inside a tent for most of it, anyway.    Days were good, nights were hell, I danced and cooked and wept for my Trojan sisters that were jailed like me.    I was beaten least out of all the girls. Achilles didn't like the look of bruises on me- my skin was too fair to hide the marks, and for all his faults, he wasn't a sadist. I was never an Athena or an Artemis. Just Hestia, a woman of the hearth.        Okay, Okay! I know what I did wasn't   mature.   But I was   right.   I don't regret the hill I chose to die under.     I punched Creon before I died. I fought right up until the end, even when he lowered me into my grave I was still screaming, damning him with every bit of breath I had, using my blood to seal that curse.     There's nothing worse than a disrespecter of the dead, you know? Killing is one thing-  eternal torment is  another.     I had a soft heart. If I hadn't died for Polyneices, I would have never slept again.     Oh Aphrodite,     I slept in gardens of roses, crowns of lavender on my head, and there was barley underneath her fingernails.     Is this the sorrow I must bear, Aphrodite? For I have been ensnared in a web of desire, and I see her lips, flushed and smiling, in my sleep.     I am sick on daisies-     Why was I cursed, Aphrodite, to love a woman who has pledged herself to Artemis, the moon-faced goddess?     Her skin reminds me of the sand, her eyes; the seashells, and when she speaks, the ocean roars.     Release me, Aphrodite! I am sick on her smile.    (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I am not ashamed to be a woman of the hearth. After all, we cannot all be Aphrodites, Artemises, Athenas. Some of us have to tend to the hearth.     Do I not belong in the list of women who have changed history? Am I not man enough? Am I too soft, peaceful, too willing to situate myself as a peacemaker rather than a fighter of the law?     I have no man and no woman. I have no mother and no father. I am   Hestia,   protector of the hearth, patron of unsatisfied young women and lover of light. I am Hestia.   Oh my god guys I've been writing this play about sappho and legit every page takes me a full hour to write, if not longer, because I have to translate all of the sappho fragments I want to use in the play and I'm piecing it altogether like a puzzle and anyway I really hope my friend knows someone who would want to put it on as a play. It's not my best work but it's certainly my hardest work.   So little is said about me, I wonder if I exist outside of Briseis and my father.     There's not much to say, really. I was just another one of the slave girls, nothing special about me except that somebody cared enough to come after me, and a god cared about him enough to let me free.     And isn't that the story of every woman in the war?     We were nothing, really. Just girls unlucky enough to be caught in the wrong place, and therefore, we were subject to the insatiable appetites of men no different than the men of Troy.     Frankly, what men do is their own concern. I cared about Polyneices, of course I did, do you think I'm some kind of   monster?   I just didn't think there was anything I could do without getting my own self killed.     Antigone proved that.     She always cared too much for her family, even when they didn't care for her.      I was a pragmatist. Get in, get out, try to have a little joy. Be ugly enough that nobody important  wants you, pretty enough to be married. In, out, done.     Antigone always had grander aspirations, which I think is what killed her.     Oh come on, I know how you people see me now. I used to be beautiful. Cow eyed, they called me. Now, I suppose I'm just another pinched-face nanny.     They have an   obsession,   down on earth. Either you're beautiful and free and young, or you're old and bitter and hateful. Tell me, was I any less vengeful than Aphrodite? Than Athena?     I loved Zeus. I loved his body, his power, his wars. I also loved   not having to win that love every single goddamn day.   And what do I get for that? I get called a prude and a shrew.         (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    It was a pithos I opened, which is different from a box. A box means curiosity. It means lack of restraint.     A   pithos   means I was just trying to get some oil, which makes it worse, in a way.     Every religion has a hungry woman at the base of it. She who wants to eat more than she wants to wait.     What is she waiting for? Her husband. He will provide food, provide glory, until the day he doesn't. If I was made to be a perfect slave to Zeus, why do I go to Hades because I was   hungry?    I wrote ""every religion has a hungry woman at the base of it"" and now I'm applying for a 1200 dollar research grant to talk about hunger and the feminine in greek mythos. I think I've really got something here. I expressed to my professor that I feel like it's not original and he said ""people have been studying this for 3000 years. You signed up to not be original."" So. I hope I get the money. I want a new computer.   What was I supposed to do? The last thing my husband did ere he set sail for Illium was to kill my child. He didn't kiss me goodbye, he didn't give his sons a parting word, no. He killed my daughter.     How is my daughter worth any less than Helen? They killed her for   Helen,   my own sister, who would have died easily for my daughter. Come to think of it, she would have died for less, but that's besides the point.     He killed my youngest daughter, that's a crime I can't forgive.  He murdered my Iphegenia in cold blood.        Here's a secret: I'm not a protector of girls. Oh sure, I'm wild and I'm woman  ,   but I was made by a man who told stories to a man who survived by the history of men and was placed into academia by men and for men, to be talked about and remade and written about by men.     So I'm the protector of virgins, not of women.     I care for the clean and the pure, for the young and the proper, for the women that are women that are hunters that are temple-worthy soft and beautiful.     The others go to Bacchus.        I begged you not to leave, Hector, I begged it of you. But no. You knew better, so you abandoned us in the castle, leaving me to nurse my son in his last hours alone, with no comfort and no protection as the wily man found me. I became a slave, Hector, the person you could not bear to see me become. I bore children for Greek men, your own son dead underneath the rubble of Troy, and for what? Your pride? You could have given Helen back yourself under cover of night if you really wanted me to live.        He left me on an island, and two days later, a wine god wants to make me his wife. I won't say anything unflattering about Bacchus- I wouldn't dare- But the men in my life have never once been a blessing.     Did you know that when I was little, I wanted to become a priestess? My father forbade it, because then he wouldn't have a girl to use as a pretty little pawn in his political games.     Maybe that's why I wanted Theseus's hand in marriage. To spite my family. Maybe I just wanted to leave that god damned island.     (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I might be the only one of these women who's gotten myself through life unscathed.     Unscathed, of course, being a relative term.     Here's the thing: I was mostly normal, and for all the women that Odysseus exchanged words with,   mostly   normal was good. It meant that I was half a human, and therefore I might not be wrapped up in the way of the gods. Making Odysseus walk behind me was the best choice I ever made in my sad, sorry life, and it might have been one of the only ones too.     Oh well. Count my blessings, I will.       My welsh teacher is going to teach me how to press grapes this weekend and thats somehow not the weirdest thing I'm dealing with   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    There is so little of me left, and what I have is saturated with pain. I wish I had written more. I wish I had written better. I wish what I had written had not been laced with honey-sweet sorrow, so thick and cloying that it melted away the better part of me. Grieving becoming my only bedfellow, and me, becoming more and more a part of the tenth muse- unwilling or unable to pull away from her. What could I have become, I wonder, if the loving part of me had survived? What kind of love could I give?      So the thing about erinna is that she's known for her sad poetry, right? Specifically about her lover, baucis. But we only have one bit of a bigger poem she wrong and three epigrams- everything else she wrote is lost. And it makes me think: yes, she wrote sad poetry but there must have been some glimmer of hope, had more of her writing survived. She must have written something good, and the amount of poetry that we lose to time is a tragedy in and of itself.   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I am a warrior with a sword, I have bested Ares in battle more times than I can count, I am Pallas Athena, the warrior maiden of wisdom, and the keeper of crafts from the lowest slave to the highest nobleman.     I am well renowned for having no mercy, I am tied to Odysseus in a way that I cannot escape, I loved his consort more.     It's a strange thing, to be a god and a servant at the same time. Strange, that my life still depends on wit and will, even now. Should not the world be my domain?    Athena is so interesting. She's a woman. She has no mother. She is a man in all the ways that it matters. She patronizes weaving. She patronizes war. She is the odysseus of the gods- who is another man-woman figure.   I told him not to go. He asked my advice, and I told him that going to see the man who killed my son would be stupid. But I was the stupid one, thinking that he would actually listen to me.     He was killed on the altar, right before I was killed just the same way, begging for mercy from the son of the man whose hands my husband kissed on the beach. Oh, what a tangled web we weave.     Like it could have been better- Troy was going to fall, whatever friends my husband made across no man's land.      What was there to complain of, except that she had been loved?      There was a lot to complain of. The horrible lot that I was dealt, for one, and the way that my husband wouldn't seem to give up, let me drink from the Lethe in peace. It was love, but it was that kind of destructive love that keeps your soul on earth far longer than necessary. The kind of love that kept Achilles from burying Patroclus until Hector was dead. I'm not angry, not exactly. I'm disappointed, and I'm sad, and I wish I had never met Orpheus.    I took on the role of Lesbia, of Cynthia, of Delia, I am nothing but a Gorgo to history anymore. A lament of poetry, remembered through my lover. Perhaps I should have done more.     I doubt that.     What else could I have done? I exchanged kisses with Erinna, she wrote about our childhood, running through the waves and splashing on the shore, and everything we have lost- death ruins it all, she said.     Did she mean to remember me through centuries of reinterpretation and language? Was I the lover she looked for in the smoke? Tell them- I am Baucis.     My son was stupid. But you already knew that.     I was given to Peleus as a war prize. But you already knew that, too. Here's something you don't know: I hated Achilles.     I loved him too, but I hated the parts of him that reminded me of Peleus, I hated his smile and his god-damned honor, I hated him, and I loved him with all the force of a mother unwilling to give up her son.     Maybe I wish I had a daughter.     Maybe that was why I tried to make him into one on Skyros, though it never worked.     (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I'm still out here, feeding pigs to men and making men into pigs, and I'm not sorry.     I know the ending of my story. I marry Telemachus, and who knows what happens after that? I don't matter beyond the family of Odysseus.     Kiss me and kill me, sail away- he wasn't a kind man, not in the slightest, which was unsurprising after all he went through. I was one of those trials, and I'm not sorry about that, either. Am I evil for fulfilling the purpose I was built for?     The most terrifying woman is a witch with a mouth.    Still waiting to see if I got that research grant to study women's mouths in greek literature.... I'm gonna check right after i post this   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)     I spoke the greek of the home, of the women who could not leave, of the trapped. But you, Pindar, you spoke the greek of the city-states and the streets. I worshiped the women and I was quiet, but I am content with that, though you are remembered better. Did you ever think to see echoes of us in our later iterations?     I have told stories from the coast of Mytilene to the shores of New York city. I have lived in homes abandoned and the fragrant crowns of Sappho have pillowed my fall.  And what has that made me?      If you haven't read corinna go do so. She's so good.   What is a Mark Antony to a powerful woman?     More power, of course. He sips at my pearls and wine, gets drunk on sex and power, all the while, Octavius takes the senate for his own.     You would think that the way I used both Julius and his adoptive son would have made me a more powerful figure in Roman history, but I just became the exotic slut.     We humans have always been the same, I suppose.     What am I to do? What role am I meant to play? And don't you dare tell me to be a woman again.     Women marry monsters. It's what we do.     Not by choice, mind you, and certainly not of our own volition. But men are the monsters that control our lives, and we bear their children and weave their clothes and send them off to war and rejoice when they die and then go on living with a strange sort of melancholy in our hearts.    Who can blame me for wanting to see the monster I married? To know if I married a monster?     Women marry monsters. It's what we do. I thought that I was smarter, but it was never  my choice.     I'll tear your flesh from your body, eat it raw and whole, soak you in unwatered wine and when you are tender and supple underneath my tongue, I will rip you to pieces and laugh.     I am not beholden to a man. There is no system that I serve. I am wild and free and like a puppet on a string, I must be an anti-woman.     You see, I am not a girl, not exactly. I am the image of one, the scarecrow of a maiden. In all the ways that it matters, I am quite clearly   not   a woman.        I'm actually rather proud of my son. Angry, yes, but proud. He grew into the man that I raised him to be.     That was, perhaps, an oversight on my part.     If you raise a monster you get a monster, if I raised a thief I got myself a thief, since I raised a murderer, he killed me and kept the secret badly.      I deserved it. We always do. But Nero grew into a woman, and that disappointed me, and I wonder if that says more about me or about him, that I will not let him be what I am.  ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
39958143;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"     In many joyful moments pain and despair might follow it, birth and death, night and day.     a god, an anomaly even. Destroyed in just two foal strikescrying not from sadness a baby born an hour later   Zagreus   a god none of the others paid much attention to but put fear every time he so as stepped in a room. He claimed to be the son of hades and had only then publicly showed his faces.  Eyes a empty gold color that have seen stuff that will never be unseen. Long Hair as black as the night that went to his shoulders.Horns peaking out wrapped around by plants like the flowers in a pomegranate trees like a tribute to his loving caring mother the Lovley Persephone , pale skin just like his father. His fathers symbols tattooed into his skin. Bags under the eyes a pitch black chiton with gold sticking out of it. a broken skull on his shoulder. And a spear with blood on the top of it with a man descending in the river Styx's carved into it  the son of hades was unknown to the Olympians quiet being able to not be seen and he was okay with that. All his god hood entailed was watching the others bicker which got boring very quickly going back home take of the souls for the rest of the day talk a bit to the usually sleeping Hypnos and if he got lucky Thanatos. Hypnos barley keeping track about what zagreus was saying and just nodding and saying okay. His eyes were under a blindfold and to this day no one has seen him without it His hair was messy and hold together by a hair tie with pale short of graying skin and wearing something that you can sleep in. Thanatos was quite different who wore a hood on top chiton had grey hair and back eyes with white pupils his eyes were long and pointy and in the right light you would swear you saw black wing in him. Unlike his brother he would listen care fully on what zag said and would politely exit out of the conversation when he needed to leaving zag alone and just continuing on with his job then retreat back to his family talk to them then relax on his bed then it's day again.  His relationship with his parents was easy going  The mother of his named Persephone was kind to him always making sure he was okay and what not, make him something quick to eat and bid him a goodnight. She had a lighter blond hair with the best way to describe them zircon like hazel eyes and a light pink in her face. She wore a dress in black covered in gemstones and flowers like the ones on him and the singular on her head which was a gift by hades given the day she first got to see Demeter, her mom again, zag actually had never really met or talked to Demeter because he just didn't want to.  then their is his father hades.  he carried deeply for zagreus even if he didn't always like to show it he carried for the kid and he always has and always with. Hades had curly white hair and s little bit of wrinkles in you were to look closely he keep his Helmet near him all the time and some pieces of his old amor on him when he was in the titan war all those years ago.  every now and then he would check up on zag and make sure he was doing well zag always told him he was alright and hades would to him fully what happen during the day. Zag always liked these times where he could just let it all out and talk fully with someone who did wanna listen it made him feel okay okay okay  each day was okay nothing interesting nothing special just okay that would change really fast and he could handle this change.  December 24 year long forgotten Zagreus got to curious and drowned also remember as a day hades and Persephone will never forget  Zagreus started the day like any other dress himself up one last time in a tuxedo like uniform. Fitting for a funeral. He had not slept good so he took a quick trip through the underworld. This day he was able to talk to Thanatos and Hypnos  ""good morning everyone"" Zag said Politely  ""Wait it's morning already damn, Also good morning prince Zagreus"" Hypnos spurred out  ""by the gods he's hopeless, anyways. Morning zag say I have never in my many years of living seen you wear a tux why the change"" Thanatos asked zag. Zagreus simply said that he had a weird feeling to just wear it Thanatos asked nothing more.  Until zagreus started walking towards a different area of the underworld  ""Zag where are you going?""  ""somewhere, somewhere.""  Thanatos had the feeling that something was wrong and after awaking his brother both of them followed zagreus. That was not gonna be the only thing strange about this day.   When walking they saw a hecatoncheire walk past them destroying stuff in the process. Zag stopped walking and called out to him  ""you there"" zagreus ""shouted what are you doing out of your post. You could put us all in danger because of the titans""  ""forgive me, young prince"" the hechatoncheire cried out.  ""so thirsty... so hungry""   Zagreus was confused as he thought they didn't eat the guy ran off leading to Thanatos and Hypnos to nearly get caught hiding under a rock that they were sure the hechatoncheire broke  Zag was right now to tired to deal with him so he continues his walk but keeping his guard up   at this point Thanatos had message hades to come to his location and hades agree to, a surprise to them as he had always seen hades as the type to say no. Later during the walk of zagreus he noticed a crack mirror and started to look at it thinking the hechatoncheire guy must have cracked it. Just them he heard something turned around yet saw nothing just then he felt someone hit him throwing him into the ground. He quickly got back to his feet and got to a safer area. That is when he realized what he was looking at a titan, he wasn't sure which one though. But in that one moment zag thought to do only one thing...     Survive   he lunged himself at the titan pulling out his spear and hitting it with it. Even more titans appeared all wanting to kill.He cut, He hit, He dodged, he injured. All it took to survive. He transformed himself into multiple animals such as a snake lion and more. With one good hit he was able to cut the arm of a titan it's yells filling the area. He broke another ones leg, ripped a titans eye out and more. He threw himself into the air and just as he was gonna throw a finishing strike to one of them he heard a cry so loud he lost balanced and feel about 50 or more feet to the ground badly injured. He looked and saw Hypnos and Thanatos in shocked just starting at him and not being able to help. He cried and cried for help and got nothing in return as the titans pinned him down and grabbed his very own spear just for it to plunged into him by the titans blood pouring out of it. He tried to keep it together but simply just screamed for anyone. He thought of all the stuff he didn't get to do but was cut of when he felt someone tear his leg off he screamed. Screamed so loud you swear you could hear it from Olympus he heard people, probably Hypnos and Thanatos crying and begging the titans to let him go. But they didn't listen to them. He heard crackling beneath him and he realized the titans started a fire to burn him alive. He felt his very own skin tearing away his muscles, blood, and organs. He yelled screamed and cried but they didn't care. They ripped him apart first the legs then the arms then they went to his head     the last thing Zagreus, the prince of the underworld saw was his mother's teary eyes and his own heart being ripped out of him     ...     ...     ...     ...                                                                 ""Welcome to the world little one""  Dionysus, right after a tragedy to be born     A room up in Olympus that the king of the gods Zeus and his wife Hera relaxed after a long, loud, busy day That same room that was usually a quiet place was filled with the crying from the newest and now youngest  daughter of Zeus   ""cmon little one, open your eyes""  After a while the crying was able to leave the room and the baby finally opened her eyes. The first thing she saw was her fathers long, cloud like beard and next his blue as sky eyes, then the giant smile on his face. She simply giggled and smile. He gently placed her on his bed while he looked around his room looking for something to cover her body with. After a while he was able to find a tiny blanket for her. Just before he wrapped the cloth around her he examined her features one last time.  She had beautiful brown eyes that reminded him of her late mother Semele. Who asked him to show his godly figure but the moment he did she died and turned to ash. With his daughter, the one he is looking at. Surviving. While still sadden of what happened he simply put the thought to the back of his head. The child is innocent zeus remember and went back to examining her. In his prime Zeus was said to how Lovley brown hair and it seemed like the baby inherited the color of it. Her skin was a light caramel color with rosy lips and cheeks, she was so much smaller than any of his children, mainly because she was born from a mortal.  Zeus wrapped her in the blue blanket cover her head so that mostly the rest of the gods would not see her, except one.  ""Hermes!""  In about 2 seconds Hermes appeared in front of him. He had short curly hair with a ponytail that was light brown with one neon yellow eye and the other blue. He wore a helmet with four wings with 2 on each side he had light skin and he had freckles with a bandage on his cheek he wore his normal wing sandals and long black shorts with w white shirt with a backpack to hold any mail he had.  ""Gooood afternoon sir why did care to see me"" Hermes said with his cheerful voice  Zeus looked back at the girl in the blanket and handed it to Hermes  ""go to earth and when you are safe open the blanket. Also make sure my wife doesn't see you"" Zeus told Hermes  ""yes sir"" Hermes said and left  as he flew he looked around to make sure no one saw him after flying for 8 seconds he found a abandoned house in Thebes. It was a 3 room house and after finding the bed he laid the blanket on top of it. It would be alright if he left it for 10 seconds to find and talk to Apollo, Right?   He zipped back to Olympus and after a while found Apollo playing music with the muses, his blonde hair in them waving in the air looking as beautiful as ever . Before Apollo could say anything he grab his arm and zip back to Thebes. He opened the door of the house  ""Hermes, what the fuck man!"" Apollo yelled and pulled his arm back. Right after he yelled they heard crying coming from the bed. Apollo sweared he felt his heart drop for a moment he and Hermes quickly ran to the bed that the blanket was on.  ""Alright Apollo act normal don't freak out, okay?"" Apollo nodded and Hermes went to the blanket and open it   The moment they say it they screamed causing the baby to become more stressed out. Apollo started to relax and picked her up  ""calm down, calm down. It's okay"" cradling her and started sing a lullaby to her for her to calm down.  After a while she stopped crying then started to cooing at him. Hermes got closer and made a gesture to hold her. D  ""she's beautiful..."" Hermes whispered as the baby started to fall asleep in his arms. They gently put her back down and then both moved to another room   ""okay so...who's baby is that?!"" Apollo asked Hermes  ""she...I think she's are sister"" Hermes replied  ""WHAT!?"" Apollo yelled out   ""remember when Zeus was hitting on that chick Semele. I think he got her pregnant and that's her kid. Zeus handed her to me to hide her from Hera"" Hermes explained with Apollo staying silent   ""so...what now"" he asked  ""I'm gonna look for someone to take care of her, in the mean time I'm gonna take care of her""  ""Hermes are you sure? With your schedule she is gonna be neglected I can help you take care of the kid"" Apollo said. After thinking about it he had a picture of a possible schedule  ""Apollo can you before the night take care of the kid while I can care for her during the late morning and whenever you have time take care of her because of my jobs I can't take care of her until Sunday as that's when I can rest""  Apollo thought about it and then nodded as he could do that   ""my muses can also help us"" Apollo said which Hermes could definitely use.  ""oh yea also what her name"" Apollo asked which make Hermes freeze up   ""How about...d-dion""  ""ysus"" Apollo requested  ""yea...Yeah! her name with be Dionysus""  Dionysus spends 8 years with Hermes and Apollo and spends 2 years with ino then it all goes terribly wrong.                      It's been 8 years sense that we found you in that blanket and they are three years I will always hold dear  I still remember when you didn't have a name and it became a guessing game of what your name will be, in time of writing you have become a beautiful little girl that I will go on to call our daughter also  i wonder when are you gonna meet your daddy, he make be unreliable sometimes but he always appear when you least expect it.  Anyways I'm sorry I can't always be there with you because of work but even then I have gotten to see you grow up. it could be forty years yet you will forever be my little girl, who I care for deeply and wish to see thrive.   oh yea as for your other father how is he treating you? If he lays one single finger on you please let me know so him and I could...""talk"",alright I sadly don't have much time left as I'm writing in my work place so I wanna say 5 simple word.     I love you so much     Love .       Hermes (aka papa)    P.S if you see a woman named Hera,   run                                       ""Come on dio sweetie wake up"" Hermes said with his calmest voice as he gently rocked dion to wake up. Dionysus gently open her eyes looking up at papa as her eyes lit up with excitement   ""PAPA'S NOT AT WORK!, PAPA'S NOT AT WORK!"" Dionysus yelled as she sprung up excitement filling her voice,  this was one of the few moments she got to see Hermes making him being here even more a time to celebrate   Hermes just chuckled ""alright, alright my little lighting bolt lets gets you dressed up today is gonna be a big day for you"" he said while picking her up and being her to her closet. He picked out a toga that she liked to wear because in her words it was comfy. He changed her from her plain white sleeping gown to the cream color toga   ""oh I nearly forgot, in one of my jobs I got this. Here"" Hermes held up a pendent that had grapes carved into it and also solid gold""   Dionysus gasped then grabbed it saying ""THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU"" hopping a bit will she held it. Hermes smiled and picked her up to walk to the other room. The first thing dio say was Apollo, mainly his sky blue eyes like zeuss   ""Hi dada"" Dionysus said pulling Apollo out of concentration  ""hello dion"" Apollo said pinching Dionysus cheek. Hermes places Dionysus to a chair and went to a big pot to make a soup for the three of them. Apollo sat down next to Dionysus to talk  ""dion how do you feel?""  ""happy and you?""  ""im alright, is their anything you would change?""  ""I want to live in a big house with you guys dada""  Apollo simply smiled petting her head  ""When we done eating can I go out?""  ""of course dear""   ""Done!"" Hermes said bring two soups to them. Leaving to get his. The soup was made of lentil with bread next to it. Hermes sat down and after that they started eating. While eating they told jokes. Talk about random stuff. Chatted of what they are gonna do that day. Like going to the forest going to town and in Hermes word meeting someone.  when dio finished she ran outside while Apollo and Hermes still ate. The forest was near her house so she went there. The deeper she went into it the more she saw. She saw goats, women walking in the forest. Birds not realizing the deeper she went the more she was lost. The moment she turned around she realize that she was lost. That moment the happiness she felt was gone and was replaced with fear. What was onces Lovley became different and mysterious. It all looked the same and she no longer saw her house or anything just trees, trees and more trees  she looked back and saw one of the women again.  ""Hello?"" The women said seeing Dionysus  ""H-hello can you help me?"" Dion said getting closer to her  ""What's wrong dear"" the lady said  ""I got lost from my home"" Dionysus said  ""oh dear you poor thing, follow me she said giving her hand to her. Dionysus took it and started walking with her deeper in the forest. She suddenly stop and Dionysus looked  She saw many beautiful women dancing, swimming, talking and giggling, the ladies made Dionysus blush. Their where men and women who didn't look fully human they were half human but with the bottom part being that of a horse like the ones her dad's would tell her about when she struggled to sleep in her bed in the loud nights . They talked to each other, slept or galloped around. But what caught Dionysus eyes was men who looked have goat with horns legs of goat. Singing, eating, play the most Lovley of music. Or trying to talk to the women. the area she was in was filled with both fruits and flowers blowing and thriving all around there were many areas like ponds with sea animals in them of all types. Animals were everywhere eating to their hearts content. Or sleeping. There was just the right amount of sunlight in the area where it was never cold but never to hot.  she walked around looking at the place the women places her in. She turned and the women went the the other ladies and talk. Dionysus saw a young boy with tiny horse and the same goat legs as the older ""oh hello"" the young boy said to her  ""hi..."" she responded looking at him  ""I've never seen you here what's your name?""  Dionysus thought if it would be a good idea to give him her name but he was her age so it would be okay, wouldn't it?  ""I'm Dionysus"" she said  ""my name is Ampelus"" the boy or Ampelus said   ""Hey Dionysus what are you doing here?""  ""I got lost from home when I went to walk"" Ampelus thought for a moment   ""If you are gonna go to your family layer why don't you first spend some time here you know before the later?""  ""Ampelus I must leave my parents are worried for me""  ""Alrighty then but don't come crawling back to me later okay?"" Ampelus said in a joke way The more Dionysus though about it the more she though that it would not be a bad idea to stay here a little longer. While home was well homey this was new, something even many cunning men only dreamed of by the help of the sleep god...what's his name again? Hypnos. Right, right Hypnos. Papa and dada wouldn't mind having her see pure beauty for a while. Dionysus walked up to another of the ladies. She had long blonde hair. Green leaf eyes. Freckles on her checks and was barley wearing anything leaving her breast exposed ""Excuse me miss, can I stay here?"" Dion asked ""Of course you can. But make sure not to make a wreck of this place okay"" she said  dion thought about it and nodded ""alight then get yourself comfortable here"" the lady said happily  Dionysus started walking around and went across the men with goat features playing music she carefully walked to them and ask if she could play on the pan pipes. They nodded and made her a new one. She stat down on a rock and she started place but Ampelus wasn't impressed  ""No you're doing it all wrong here let me help you""  Ampelus started helping her how to play them properly and getting really close to her. The more she played the smother the music was becoming and she started relaxing her mind only being of the sound of the sweet music she was playing. She was a quick learner which made it more easy for Ampelus to teach her. She played and played until she was tired. She gave the pan pipes to Ampelus. He lifted her up from the rock and walk to the fruit area. He picked stuff like cherries to try out. She put one in her mouth and bit feeling the cherry explode in her mouth as she chewed she tried her best to savor the flavor. Getting another and doing the same thing   Ampelus got some fruit for himself and ate with her next to him. When they were finished their hand were covered in red just like their mouths they fed each other until they f were full and no longer could eat anymore. To make sure that their food was digested they walk around so it would go down the area talking a bit of what they wanted to do in the future and about what Amp did before he met dion. They walked near the ladies who waved at them. It had been good over and hour as they walked around and laughed. They talk about bull riding which Amp boasted he was the greatest at it making Dionysus wonder how good he was. They talked about what Amp did before he met her, He said he would move from forest to forest trying out new things. Dionysus talked about how she surprisedly didn't know much of her parents or what they did. Where they worked at and more. After talkingAmpelus guided her to a gains tree in the middle and took her behind it  Dionysus was confused about why he brought her here. He asked if what he was about to do okay and Dionysus nodded just the Ampelus closed his eyes, and kissed her in the lips she was first in shock but by the second her mind was leaving her body as she couldn't think anymore yet also it screamed to her yes . So she just closed her eyes she kissed him back. His lips tasted like the fruits they had eaten and she wouldn't be surprised if her lips tasted the exact same. This boy had stolen her first kiss and she didn't even care about as she melted with him  After god knows what time they parted the the kiss and just looked at each other ""I'm so so sorry"" Amp said ""no no it's okay"" Dionysus replied. With both of them walking from behind the tree.  Just then in a flash both Apollo and Hermes appeared, both seeming to be in a panic  ""WHERE IS SHE?!"" Hermes screamed at one of the ladies with some of the ladies turning into trees. The men and women who where half horse ran away while goat men ran with them. Hermes grab Dionysus by the arm bragging him. While amp hid behind the tree   ""you can't even comprehend how much trouble you are in               Dear Hermes, god of roads    After much thought I would like to adopt the girl as my own to raise,     she truly is beautiful and I promise to take good care of her as I know she means a lot to you.     Please make sure taking her under my wing will not cause me or my husband pain in the future I wish to help her grow into the most Lovley demigod in this pantheon        Signed     queen ino    ";;;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
38985855;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Artemis watched as her huntresses practiced their archery. They were the finest archers that the world had ever seen. They could hunt and track for leagues without issue. Even the devotees of her brother and rival, Apollo, could not match the skill of these women here. Plus, without the interruptions of men, these women had nothing to focus on but honing their skills. These mountains of forestry were true paradise for her. Though she would be lying if she said that she did not have other purposes for acquiring the most beautiful women she could find and training them to be her devotees. Even though she was supposed to be one of the divine maidens, she could not help but be tempted by these gorgeous women. She wanted them, wanted to claim them. Sitting in her temple, Artemis contemplated how she was going to get her first concubine. These huntress had been taught that their femininity and virginity was sacred and that none were supposed to take it. She would now have to find a way to get them to believe otherwise.   Then lightning struck her brain as an idea came to her. She could host a grand challenge, a competition and the winner would spend a night with her in the temple alone. She would promise it would be a night of great boons and honor. A prize worth a thousand lifetimes. That would entice even the most reluctant to compete she thought. Though the competition mattered little other than getting one of them to stay with her for a night. Walking out of her temple, she quickly put on her loincloth, barely able to contain her excitement. Holding up her hand to the sky as she called out,   ""Huntresses! Come to me!""   Once they were all assembled, she smiled.   ""I am going to host a very special challenge. A hunt unlike any I've ever had you do, tracking a beast deadlier than any you've ever faced. Any of you can choose to abstain from the challenge if you wish, but those of you who compete have a chance for a boon worth more than any gold or jewels. A night with me showered in my splendor and a gift worthy of a goddess. She smiled, proud of her con.   ""What say you?""   She asked before giving any further details.  Out of the many hunters she had, most were weary of their goddesses objective. Some of the older girls knew the goddess was usually hiding a trick or two up her sleeve when it came to granting rewards and boons. But in the end, three of the girls offered themselves for the task, willing to go out and hunt the beast like no other in hopes of pleasing their patron....  That had been two weeks ago. And now, the lone survivor of the girls had returned with a Griffins coat in tow and her body fully battleworn. She presented the coat of intricate feathers to her goddess and immediately felt cleansed of all dirt and grime from simply being in Artemis' luminous presence.   ""My lady..... might I claim the boon now and share your company within your temple?""  Caeda requested softly, keeping her head bowed whilst kneeling at the steps leading up to Artemis' temple.  Seeing the Griffin coat, it made her smile, as Artemis already had plans for what she could do with it. Slaying a griffin was no small task for a mortal, and to do it alone where others had failed, that was no small boast. This woman indeed was a strong huntress and warrior. The thought of fucking this woman, robbing her of her precious virtue, it was thrilling to her. She could barely contain her desire and her lust. She watched as the girl's wounds vanished, her strength returning and fatigue fading. At the girl's words, she beckoned her to follow with the motion of a single finger. Then she turned and entered the temple. With her back to the girl, she immediately took off her loincloth and then spoke.   ""You shall indeed receive the boon of my company and your gift, but this is my temple and we do not allow things like clothes or armor to be worn in these sacred halls. This is a place of nature, and as such we are to be as nature made us.""   Artemis spoke in a clear tone, looking over her shoulder and waiting to see the young girl strip.   ""I'm waiting.""   She drawled impatiently, twisting her back a bit more and folding her arms across her busty chest. Still, she kept the swollen rod between her legs hidden for the most part.  Caeda followed silently up the polished marble staircase, in awe at the power radiating from the staircase alone. Once she was at the entrance, her cheeks burned a deep crimson as the goddess commanded her to disrobe.   ""...a-as you wish my lady...""  Caeda murmured softly. She began to pull off her armor and weapons, setting them down before her clothing fell away as well and her nude body showcased the faint scars that littered her skin. She wore them proudly, having gained them in the servitude of her goddess after all. Caeda walked up to the goddess and shuddered at the cool breeze that entered the temple around them, causing her nipples to harden significantly.   ""....what now my goddess...""  Seeing the girl's young, slender, and muscular form before her, she could not wait any longer. She needed her now. She grabbed the girl by the throat, lifting her off the ground and carrying her over to the bedchamber that had been prepared for the Goddess, even though she did not need sleep. She smirked as she forcefully slammed her down onto the bed. She moved her body next to the girl's head, letting her see the monster of a shaft that was pointing out from her pelvis. With a chuckle, she looked at the girl.   ""You get your 'gift' of motherhood. You will be the first to bear the child of Artemis!""   Then she moved over top of the teen, straddling her legs and holding them together with her own stronger legs. Sure, it would be easier to penetrate her with her legs spread, but she did not want this to be easy, plus doing so would have made it less painful for the girl as well.   ""You're going to bear me a strong, beautiful line of daughters... you'll be part of my finest breeding stock now..""  Artemis breathed out heavily.  ""Aren't you?""   Her tone was full of challenge as she looked down on her seventeen year old maiden.   Caeda's hands shot out, holding tightly at Artemis' godly grip around her throat, fearing for her life in that moment until she was thrown into the deity's bed and pinned.   ""My lady no! Not my virtue!""  She reasoned, trying to push the unmoveable weight of the goddess from overtop of her naked body. Caeda had no luck in moving Artemis, so she grasped desperately for the edge of the bed, pulling herself with all of her strength until her body roughly turned and she tried to get away, feeling the godly monster of a penis slap between her firm asscheeks instead. This also gave an easier route to her hairless pussy without having to spread her legs at all.  ""Let me go! Goddess please!""  Caeda couldn't move anymore, Artemis' godly weight growing heavier with the more she resisted.  The goddess looked down as the woman begged, trying to push herself free. She smirked, just the sheer fact that she would try to deny a goddess showed more fighting spirit than most mortals. She would indeed bear a strong, powerful child. Though, resistance cannot be tolerated. She smacks the girl firmly across the face as she growls in her ear.   ""You will do as your goddess commands. Do not question me again.""   She hissed in a stern, almost cruel tone.   Seeing the bare pussy on full display for her, she placed a hand on the girl's lower back and pushed down a bit, making her bend more. Then she took her hand and ran it along the girl's slit. Glistening juices immediately coated her finger, and as she sucked her finger clean the divine taste had her moaning in bliss.   ""You act like you don't want this, but your body tells the truth.""   She placed the tip of her cock against the hole, then pressed just enough that the head would start to spread her lips but not fully enter her.   ""Do you love your goddess?""   Artemis asked curiously with a smirk.  Caeda's nipples hardened painfully as a chain reaction to the contact of Artemis' fat cock head pressed up against her cunt. She shuddered and let the tears flow freely, the tear droplets wetting the bed as her womb began to burn. Being in the presence of a fertility goddess whom intended to breed caused her womb to eagerly ready itself to create life from the potential divine seed.   ""....please goddess.... I love my goddess... don't do this to me!""  Caeda's voice cracked as she begged. She was shaking as her wet cunt began to spread, not putting up the slightest fight against the godly cock that was going to enter her.  The goddess just watched as she saw the girl sobbing onto the bed. She smacked her ass firmly with one hand an then continued to push her hips further down. First, the cock head entered the narrow, human passage. It was a good thing her walls were so wet and had already started stretching for her. She could hardly contain herself, but she did not want this over quickly. Artemis wanted to savor every one of this girl's reactions. She wanted to take her time with this oro huntress. She started kissing her neck as she slowly slipped deeper until she met a bit of resistance and smirked.   ""Push your hips towards me and rip your virtue on my cock, or I'm going to get very rough with you.""   Artemis then smacked the girl's ass for emphasis. Her cock was already throbbing in the tight, wet canal.   ""You thought I gather women as gorgeous and powerful as yourself with no intention ofclaiming them? Don't tell me you're that naive.""  Caeda gasped out, her body trembling as she pushed up on her hands, wincing from the ass jiggling slap. She didn't want to anger her goddess, the love she held for the moon deity outweighed the fear and anger she felt about losing her virtue.   ""Y-Yes m'lady...""  Her hips shifted as she pushed up on her palms and then rocked a little bit, flinching from how painful the cock felt inside of her stretched out cunt. Taking a deep breath, she suddenly went for it, slamming her hips back fully and destroying her hymen. A loud cry escaped pass her lips and she slumped down into the bed again, blood coating the goddesses cock as proof of her virtue sacrifice to her patron.   Whilst outside of the temple, some of the huntresses avoided the suspicious cries of their sister in the temple being raped by the moon goddess.  Artemis was loving this, the loyal obedience, the unquestioning loyalty. This girl did not want to be fucked, did not want her virtue taken, but because her patron goddess had demanded it, she sacrificed her virginity to the mammoth rod of her goddess. The feeling of the fat, juicy toned ass slamming against her pelvis felt incredible, and she loved the way it jiggled from the impact. Then as the goddess leaned herself forward, a wide smile grew across Artemis' face, seeing the blood trailing down her shaft.   ""Such an obedient little slut.""   She said and smacked the girl's ass, this time far more playfully.   Then she pushed the teen's head down onto the bed, and let her hand run down the girl's back to her waist.   ""But we're not done yet.""   She grabbed Caeda's hips in both hands, pulling them back roughly and began to thrust, her balls slapping loudly, painfully against the girl's clit. She did not care that the girl screamed, she did not care if the huntresses outside grew curious. Right now, she had a fertile female to breed, one whose body was more than accommodating her every need. She slammed in faster and faster, knowing her balls would bruise the girl's clit, just like her rod would bruise her cervix. Artemis moaned as her cock began to throb.   ""Are you ready for my seed? Are you ready to bear my child?""  Artemis moaned, lowering her lips to Caeda's ear and licking the lobe lightly.   Said girl huffed into the bed, breasts swaying and jiggling with every thrust. She felt herself burning from the inside out, the goddesses girth incredibly hot and pulsating wildly in her cunt. There was truly no stopping the goddess. Not when she seemed to have a very clear mission at hand.   ""....my lady.... please....""  Caeda pleaded, gasping out haggardly as her pelvis bulged with every thrust, accommodating such a large cock. To carry a god's offspring should be the biggest honor, but she felt more terrified than anything.   From across the temple bed chambers, Artemis had a secret audience of one of the younger Huntresses. She was only ten years old, Vivian was her name. The child was wide eyed in wonder, watching the goddess make her sister huntress moan and cry into the large bed. Viv was so confused by what was going on.  The way her body felt was incredible, Artemis had begun to see why men seemed so obsessed with conquering women. In fact, she was beginning to wonder if she should just breed all her huntresses and then go out and find more. The more she slammed into this girl, the more her balls ached and her cock throbbed. She gripped the teen by the back of the head, pushing her hard into the mattress. She began slamming her hips into her with all the force she could muster.   ""You don't have to beg me to breed you, lovely. That's what I'm going to do!""   Then at last she began to cum, shooting rope after rope of a thick golden cream into the girls cunt. She did not stop thrusting, letting her juices run out of the girl and onto the bed beneath them. Then she smiled when she finally pulled out, shooting more of her spunk over Caeda's raped body.   ""You're the first to be blessed by my seed dear, but make sure you tell no one of what happened. Am I clear?""  Caeda's womb accepted the seed hungrily, causing her belly to glow softly before the light began fading as Artemis' cock pulled out of her stretched pussy. Godly seed oozed out of her gaping cunt as sobs wracked the teens sweaty body and she fisted the bedsheets in defeat. It took her a few minutes to recover before she was able to get up from the bed, bowing in respect to her goddess before hurrying out of the temple with tears in her hazel eyes. Caeda dressed quickly at the temple stairs and avoided the gaze of all the other huntresses whilst striking out to go hunt something and burn away some anger.   ""M'lady.... why was Caeda crying?""  Vivian spoke up, coming out of the shadows and playing with the hem of her dress. She really should not have been spying on them.  The goddess was pleased with her self. Despite the fact that she had just committed one of the acts that she claimed only men would do to these huntresses, the rush she felt from it was incredible. Her desire to further ruin and mate with more of her huntresses increased exponentially. She wanted to break someone. Then she heard a small, timid voice. Her eyes went wide with panic and anger. She grabbed the small child by the back of her neck.  ""YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU ARE NEVER TO ENTER MY CHAMBERS WITHOUT PERMISSION!""  Her voice rang out, filling the entire room. She backhanded the girl across the face before throwing her face down onto the bed.   ""You will speak when spoken to. This was a training exercise for Caeda, she failed. Let's see if your will is stronger.""   It was of course a lie, but the child was likely too naiive to know that. She growled as she slapped the kid firmly on her ass once, then again and again. Grabbing the panties of the young girl, she ripped them off. Then she began to spank the girl's bare ass, turning it pink.   ""Beg for my forgiveness! Beg to be spared from my wrath!""  Vivian screamed out, not one for pain tolerance like the older girls as she was spanked ruthlessly with her heavy handed goddess. The child sobbed and trembled in the bed, kicking her legs every so often to try and scoot away from the lust hungry moon goddess.   ""I'm sorry! M'lady! Sorry!""  Viv cried out, her red butt jiggling as she kicked away again but couldn't get very far. It was like a game of cat and mouse, the goddess was simply toying with her until she decided what to do with her.   ""F-Forgive me!""  She hicupped, burying her watery eyes and red face against the bed covers to try and muffle the cries that were escaping her soft lips...  The goddess, seething from rage, still spanked the child's ass while she begged until the skin was glowing red and would sting when touched. Afterwards, she laid the child flat on the bed, rolling her onto her back, knowing that her now sore ass was going to be pressed into the mattress, causing her pain. Then she ripped open the girl's dress with one hand. The petite body made a smile grow across Artemis face. Looking down at the girl's tiny bare cunt, she licked her lips.   ""I'm going to make you stronger too...""   She grabbed the girl by the throat as she began to rub her cock on the girl's slit. It was still slick with the mixture of her cum and Caeda's juices. The thought of adding Caeda's juices into this girl made her smirk.   ""You want to be a strong huntress, don't you?""  Artemis waited for the child's answer, but once she got it, she began to squeeze the girl's throat. She cut off her air supply as she got ready to shove her cock in. There would be no screaming this time. She did not want to risk someone older and less gullible walking in. Wasting no more time, she began to push her hips against the girl. Her tiny pussy seemed far too small for the huge cock. At first she was just pushing against the surface as the hole seemed to refuse to give. Then finally with enough pressure, she forced her way in. She did not stop, she completely buried herself in this girl, shredding her hymen and causing her stomach to bulge up nearly to her chest.  Sad as it was to admit, the ten year old was far to caught up in the tunnel vision consuming her vision, to fully process the blinding pain that was following as her cunt was forcefully ripped into, way more blood soaking the goddesses divine cock and acting as a decent lubricant. As her organs rearranged, most likely bruising internally, a cold chill filled the room quite suddenly. It wrapped around the pair and was followed by the scent of insence and strong masculine cologne.   ""You're proving to be a much more interesting niece than any other I've had the pleasure of watching grow into godhood.""  That voice, bone chilling and deep as it was, belonged to none other than the god of the underworld, Hades himself. Cold and strong, his hand wrapped around Artemis' slender throat, his jewelled rings digging against her luminous flesh. Hades was one of the big three, he was not a weak god in any way or form.   ""...look at you.... choking this child to the brink of death... your power precedes you Artemis.... so let me fix that...""  Hades' clothing shimmered in black smoke, baring his naked body to the temple as he forced Artemis to slam down onto the bed, lodging her cock even further up the child's ripped cunt as he mounted her from behind and unceremoniously began choking her lightly as his monstrous cock began to invade her sacred untouched cunt.   "".....take my cock like a godly whore....""  Hades hissed before slamming his hips into her, lodging his dick balls deep into her cunt. He was stretching her so much, her gold blood drenching his cock and dripping down his hairy ballsack as he began to thrust into her. Every hump causing her to push into the girl beneath them as he chose to rape the moon goddess and be the one god that ever claimed her cunt virginity.  She kissed the girl as she ravaged and raped her small, helpless form. Pushing her tongue into the girl's mouth, her power would keep the girl alive, even if she was literally killing her by choking her. The thrill of holding such a power over someone so innocent gave her a dark and sinister pleasure.   Though speaking of dark and sinister, when the voice that could only be Hades, emerged from the darkness, a chill went up her spine. Lord Hades, king of the underworld, god of the dead had arrived in her sacred grove. Her arousal from the very presence of this man caused her cock to grow longer and her cunt to drool more than it already was. When he grabbed her throat, his rings digging into her neck, she was all but his. He could have done anything in this moment and she would have begged and thanked him for it. Often, her dreams had been filled by being defiled by one of the big three, the most common of these dreams had been Hades. Despite what everyone often said about him, she knew Hades was not evil. Cruel, demanding, powerful, yes, but not evil. Death was fair, so the god of the dead was the same. The child's tears streamed down her face as she was ripped and torn beyond all belief as the power of two gods thrusting into her nearly broke her tiny frame. Even her hips had dislocated, but then were being healed by the power Artemis held over the female form. When Hades' grip slacked just enough for her to speak she whispered.   ""T-thank you, m'lord.""  Artemis' insides felt like a cold fire was burning inside of her. The savage pain of Hades cock ripping her virginity was a divine horror. It was heaven and hell, agony and ecstasy. And with each thrust, she got to break this girl some more. Finally she began to cum, filling this girl with her seed, but then glanced back at Hades.   ""Her... ass... put me.... in... her ass, please....""  Her voice begged to destroy this girl's more sinful hole.  Hades however did not care for Artemis' request, but rather cloaked the woman's dick in darkness and caused it to press through shadows, reappearing against her own butthole as if through a portal.   ""Stick it in your own ass, you filthy freak.""  He growled against her ear, slapping her butt hard and watching her own cock begin to thrust lewdly up into her unprepared ass. He shuddered at the power he held over her, grabbing her hips and pulling her back roughly against his cock rapidly. His eyes closed as he focused on his own pleasure, using her body for his own whims. The same way she had done the small trembling girl beneath her. Whatever her name was, Hades took pity on her, combining his healing with hers and healing the girl until it left her in a dreamless sleep on the same bed they were fucking on like animals.  Being fucked by Hades was everything she could ever want and more. He was cold and degrading. Feeling the shadows move her cock, she did not know what else to say or do. She simply obeyed. She shoved her hips forward, and as they did, her cock rammed into her own unused, unlubed ass. The only slight relief was the blood and cum that was already on her shaft. She violated herself, the thick cock stretching her hole to the point of ripping. The power of Hades' thrusts forcing her to her knees and elbows. Then Artemis began to feel a tugging on her nipple, followd by fluid rushing out of it. Her eyes went wider.  ""Th-this is... not... allowed.... she's... drinking my... milk.""   It was one of the rules that she had made, even though she was a goddess of fertility and an eternal virgin, her body always produced milk and she had forbidden humans from ever tasting it.   ""I... must... be better... than.... that whore... Persephone...""  Hades seemed unamused by the young girl that was latched on to Artemis' breast, suckling her milk desperately. He lifted a hand, redressing her in the guise of shadows and returning her to the warmth of her own bed somewhere in the huntress camp down below. He then summoned Cerberus in his puppy form, smirking down at Artemis' as the three headed puppy sniffed around her boobs and two out of the three heads latched on to a nipple each, suckling more ravenously than the human child had been. They weren't even gentle about their claws either, pawing against her large milk sagging breasts and hungrily drinking her milk like they were starving.   ""Who knew, you'd be a useful cow yet.""  Hades mocked, encircling Artemis' flat and toned belly with his cold hands. A devious smile filtered across his lips as he thrusted into her a few more times and then began to cum, seeding her womb with his potent load, caressing her belly as it began to swell and swell until life could definitely be felt inside. Godly pregnancies were instantaneous, which was why he seemed so smug as he pulled out of her, watching his cum dribble out of her ruined cunt.  ""I hope childbirth is especially agonizing for you... maybe Hera will make sure to it..""  Hades smirked, dissolving into shadows along with Cerberus, back to the pits of the underworld he had come from. The shadows around her cock disappeared, making her erection swing between her thighs, going immediately limp...";;;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
25480942;;;;;Orpheus;;;;;;Wolves;;;;;;torn to pieces;;;;;"1. Beginning   ""the stars are not wanted now; put out every one,pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;for nothing now can ever come to any good""  w. h. auden  i watched him leave, the bitter lump in my throat coming slowly undone as he disappeared in a shimmer, carrying along the slightest scent of the ocean with him. i could hear thunder rumbling already, she was angry. i had been defiled in her temple after all, forced against the sea god with the threat of death, it was only right that she would strike him down for a few millennia.  but it was not to be.  a sudden flash of bright light and she stood before me, her gray eyes glowing with rage. she stood there terrifying and beautiful. i fell to my knees, hoping that she'd understand that it wasn't my fault, i never wanted this to happen. i dared to look into her eyes and saw the pity behind the mask of fury she wore. she knew.  cupping my face into her hands she stared deeply into my eyes, my hazel meeting her steely gray. she kissed my forehead lightly, and suddenly it felt like a flame had been lit inside me. i watched in horror as my nails grew into talons, my hair grew heavier, and it felt like it was replaced with a writhing mass. i watched my goddess as she loomed over me, offering the slightest of smiles at my new form.  ""no one can hurt you now,"" she said. her voice full of regret, she didn't want this anymore than i did. she knew, but there was nothing to be done.  this was my gift and my curse.  the day started out like any other, the scent of crushed pine needles and juniper berries arousing me from my dreams, my ears pricking up slightly as i hear soft footfalls coming outside my cavern, it's not my sisters, i can smell their scent on the cots adjacent to mine. third time this week.   i stretch luxuriously, my eyes still closed as i bat away brutus as his forked tongue tries to lick my cheek, it's his way of wishing me good morning, i hear cleo hiss angrily on the other side of my head, she's always a grumpy riser. stretching my arm above my head as i make way to the mouth of my cave to investigate the sound, even though i have a pretty good idea of what it is.  as if on cue i hear a man yell it seems to be on my right, i sense the faintest whisper of metal as i picture the sword he's holding slice through the air, not that it'd do him any good, since my transformation mortal metals no longer affected me, my skin seemed to harden whenever a sword came into contact.  i felt the blade hit my shoulder and i winced, just because it couldn't kill me doesn't mean i'm impervious to the sting. i feel andromeda rear up, preparing to strike the stranger for attempting to hurt me, brutus follows suit and without my eyes opening once the man is paralysed, screaming in shock as my snake's venom enters his blood. i slowly open my eyes, watching the man convulse on the floor, being careful not to look him in the face as i watch his stomach heave. he won't die, my snakes aren't potent enough to really kill him, only paralyse.   soon enough though his screams of pain rouse my sisters, who quickly make short work of their meal. i wrinkle my nose in disgust as i hear them cracking bones as they eat. even though i am the one who became the first gorgon my sisters are the actual monsters. i never liked eating my victims, i usually just keep them as decorations.  but despite my disdain for their culinary tastes the scent of blood stirs my hunger. i need to hunt. grabbing a bow and arrow i make my way to the mouth of the cavern before i turn around.  ""i'm going out."" i call to my sisters, i see eurydice wave her hand briefly before going back to her meal, sucking marrow from bone.  i make my way into the courtyard, blinking away the honey colored sunlight as i pick my way through the statues, making sure to touch the face of a particularly handsome youth before i make my way down to the forest surrounding the side of my mountain. i sigh in relief as the cool air brushes over me, keeping my ears pricked to listen for deer.  stopping by a small pond i look out from behind a tree carefully, if I look into the eyes of my prey it'll turn to stone becoming useless to me.  a faun.  taking a drink from the pond, it's legs still wobbly as it tries to keep balance. the mother must be by somewhere. as quietly as i can I notch an arrow, holding my breath as i aim steadily for the fauns neck. it would be a clean kill, had brutus and calypso had not decided to fight one another. the deer looks up immediately, nostrils flaring as it picks up my scent. i let loose an arrow.  i hear a small bleat of pain, and a stronger cry from what i presume to be the fauns mother. as i make my way to it i see the doe, nuzzling it's baby trying to make it stand. my arrow had pierced it's leg. the mother notices me and bolts, only running a small distance before turning around to cry for it's baby.   i kneel before it offering a prayer in thanks to artemis and apollo, and as an afterthought athena. i stroke it's soft fur, and hear it's piercing cries but there's nothing i can do. with the mother watching me i bring my knife to the faun's throat, one smooth press and a jerk of it's leg and it stills. the mother calls out once or twice before heading into another part of the forest.  i sigh heavily and lean back against a tree. my life wasn't always this hard.  by the time i get back the stranger's body has chunks of muscle torn out of his arms. inwardly i cringe, staring at the cold pools of blood that had wet the stone beneath him. i try not to look at his face, if i did that he'd turn to stone and my sisters would be unhappy. the faun is heavy in my arms, it's limp carcass halfway slung across my shoulders.   i try not to eat humans, but in the beginning i had no control over my bloodlust, and for that me and my sisters are hunted by ""heroes,"" foolish mortals who claim that the gods sent them, unaware that a goddess is the one who gave me this protection in the first place. the heroes are always male, and even after all these years i still cannot bring myself to let one touch me. i know it's not their fault, i know that, but every time one gets close i panic and my snakes do their job for me.   i set the faun down by the smoldering fire, making my way to the back entrance of the cavern where a boy with golden armor and a colt with silver and gold wings are playing. the two good things that the sea god has given me. my sons play, chrysaor trying unsuccessfully mount his older brother who just bucks him off whenever he gets himself on his back. i smile as i head back inside to prepare the faun for lunch, i think chrysaor would enjoy a stew, though pegasus will most certainly not eat any of the meat.   chrysaor is very hungry, as he always is whenever he wrestles with his brother, he smiles as he eats and despite the fact that his face resembles his father i find myself loving him more and more everyday. maybe the gods decided to be merciful to me for once when they gifted me my children, immortals that don't fear to look me in the eyes, blessings that are not repulsed by the filed down boar tusks that protrude from my lips or the snakes in my hair.  pegasus is asleep by the fire, his oversized wings spread out to cover his small body like a blanket. his brown-gold coat covered by a silver wing. he had been content to eat an apple eurydice had given him from one of the trees that grew in her garden. despite the fact that she claims she dislikes them she spoils pegasus whenever they're alone, giving him the juiciest fruit and best grain from the garden that she grows alongside her poisonous plants.   the way my sons were brought into this world was very strange, my body had been pregnant but unable to give birth, i felt them move, felt their kicks, and the pain in my womb was unbearable, no matter how many months past i was unable to release them, they were trapped in my mortal body for three years. and then a hero came, swinging a sword that was not of mortal metal wildly and screaming like cerberus himself was chasing him, he swung towards my head, and from my blood chrysaor and pegasus had emerged, wet and crying, chrysaor on the cold stone ground wailing his head off, pegasus not moving.   when i first saw them i was so terrified that i just backed away, clutching my womb where it was no longer full, a hollow feeling forming in the pit of my stomach. if it wasn't for eurydice who dried them off and fed them goats milk they would've been left there.   eventually i came around to see them, pegasus was trying to stand and chrysaor watching him, eurydice keeping an eye on them until i decided to see them myself. i got closer to them as time went on, though chrysaor originally terrified me enough that i wouldn't look him in the eyes. i was afraid that i would accidentally turn him into stone and when that fear passed it was because he had the same eye color as his father.  i adore both of my sons now, which is why i shove chrysaor behind me when he is on his way to clean his bowl, causing it to  shatter when i push him too roughly, my snakes hissing in warning as i taste the scent of a human in the air. they're in my den, i hear a sharp crack-a statue was toppled over. pegasus starts from his nap, moving behind me as i take a step toward where the noise is coming from.  i love my sons, and i will protect them as long as i live.  chrysaor unsheathed his sword, a long golden blade that is able to hurt me, a gift from his father on his 6th name day. he cherishes it deeply, even when knowing how he and his brother came to be.   i push him back, brutus hissing at him in warning, this isn't a child's game, this isn't him wrestling with pegasus, who has awoken from his nap and is staring at the entryway, nostrils flaring and eyes wide, his fledgling wings ruffling.   without warning pegasus bolts, his body becoming a mottled blur as he raced out of our cavern. fear overtakes me and without thinking i run after him into the courtyard.   the sun has begun to set and i already see artemis's chariot ascending into the sky, the sky a purplish bruise that dusts the many statues  surrounding the entrance of the cave in a haze. fearfully i look around for pegasus, but i do not see him. a soft voice alerts me, like the sound of water dripping over the rocks during the spring showers, demeter crying in joy at the return of kore.   ""nice horse, you won't hurt me will you?...is there a bird somewhere nearby, i feel feathers...""  pegasus.  my snakes start hissing excitedly, content to hear something of the whereabouts of my son. slowly i make my way towards the noise, eyes closed as i pick my way carefully through some broken statues, the voice sounded feminine, maybe not a hero.  as i move forward my dress snags on a pointy piece, a sword probably, or a hand. i stumble and topple one of the statues.  ""who-whose there?""  i hear pegasus whinny, trying to calm the person no doubt.   ""mortal, what is your purpose for intruding on my lair?""   ""mortal?"" the voice, definitely a female says, she sounds confused, why is she confused?  ""do not play games or you will face my wrath!"" my snakes are for once silent. why are they silent? what's going on?   i feel a soft nudge on my hand, pegasus has come to stand beside me. hurriedly i open my eyes to where his golden ones meet my pale yellow. a pleading look.  my attention turns to the woman before me, wearing strange clothes that contrast starkly against her olive complexion, and with a hiss brutus covers my eyes to prevent me from accidentally looking into hers.  it is obvious why he does this though at first a spell of confusion washes over me, he must see the pale milky film that fills her eyes, and for the first time in millennia i am ever grateful  for the snakes that adorn my hair.  a blind woman stares at me, her face blank and confused, she hears the hissing of snakes and the soft snorting of my son but no more than this, this is all i can afford to see.  around me the statues that have haunted my memories crumble to dust.  there is no use hiding anymore.  she speaks first, voice surprisingly calm, ""is this some kind of prank? the guys will pop out at any second right?"" she swirls around suddenly, stumbling around with her arms outstretched, expecting to feel the statue that she bumped into earlier and instead feeling nothing. the statues have crumbled to dust millennia ago, and the only thing that had kept them from completely washing away was my memory of them.  here was a farmer who sought revenge for a sheep i had killed, there was a drunken man who had tried to force himself onto me, and there closest to the entrance was a man dressed in strange attire, a helmet on his head that had blonde curls, a strange metal bird had crashed near here and he held a metal stick that shot round pebbles, he shot pegasus and i had no choice. he was still here, the only one left. though his face had been weathered away.  the woman before me came too close, and brutes hissed a warning, she jolted back and i realized how strange the clothes she wears are, a blue fabric covered her legs while another type was covering her torso, and strange shoes she wore, much like the man with the stick. i don't know how much time has passed, i've been hidden away, even my sister had left, though she tried to persuade me to go with her. i didn't and in the end it was just eurydice and i, who refused to leave her garden behind.   ""who are you?"" i ask, i have to know how much time i've missed, how many decades.  the woman looks my way, her milky eyes staring above my head. ""briseis. ""   i recoil instantly, my back going stiff. a cursed name she beared, oh cruel gods what destruction do you intend upon me? she was the catalyst of the downfall to the great hero achilles, i flinch when pegasus suddenly nudges me out of my stupor. patience has never been his virtue.  ""dude chill out."" she interrupts me, and the way she speaks makes me pause. what is a dude? ""my mom just liked greek myths and she saddled me with this name.""  ""myths?""   ""you know, pegasus and perseus, hades and persephone, medusa?""  ""how do you know my name?""  she laughs, and the sound of it infuriates me. beside me pegasus snorts in indignation, but i can see that he's spooked about it too.  ""i'm wearing a ring of her, see?"" she shoves her ring in my face and as my eyes adjust to it i see myself looking back, snakes coiled around my head and her finger, fuller lips than my own and her eyes have no pupil in them. how has this blacksmith seen me? and she's wearing it like it's just an accessory, like i'm some sort of accessory.  the setting sun behind me illuminates the courtyard around us, and with all of my willpower i ask her a single question.   ""what year is this?""  the woman before me blinks slowly, trying to process what i'm saying, her milk colored eyes are staring right at me, and it's unnerving, i'm careful not to look her in the eyes, instead focusing on her hands, long shapely things, perfect for playing the lyre.  i'm not used to being looked at head on, perhaps i once was, but now? no.   ""it's 2019."" she says finally. beside me pegasus snorts a bit, but i sense that she is telling me the truth. it's been four millennia since my transformation. two millenia since my son's were born, and three when my sister left.  the wind shifts and i am able to smell the scent of the ocean on it's current, immediately i feel nauseous. four millennia and nothing has changed, or has it?  ""what of the gods?""  ""the gods?"" her expression turns confused. she has freckles, they contrast nicely with her skin, i used to have them too, but this skin rejected all of my flaws, even the ones i liked. it's not athena's fault, she was ensuring that i had protection, even pretty flaws had to be washed away.  ""you know, athena, artemis, apollo...poseidon."" pegasus snorts and stamps his hoof into the ground, unlike his younger brother he is ashamed of his lineage. ""where are they?""  briseis looks at me again, an even more confused expression on her face. ""i don't know what you're on but those gods don't exist. they never have.""     the dust swirls around our feet as i stare dumbfounded at briseis. i can vaguely hear the rush of blood in my ears as i process her words, but still i am unable to believe it.   i don't understand what she's saying, how could the gods not exist when one of them is the cause for my transformation? how could they not exist when i have conversed with the moon and the stars themselves?   i'm unsure of what to say to this strange human, the one who believes the gods do not exist even when she is wearing my likeness upon her finger.  ""may you tell me the story of medusa?""   i imagine that her face lights up, a wide smile adorning her face that causes her nose to crinkle and eyes to squint. it must be true because her voice  is displaying the emotion of joy, how i wish i could look at her face! it has been a long time since i've seen a smile that was from someone who is not my immediate family.   ""would you prefer the long version or...uh....""  my head tilts, confused.  ""i don't know the greek word for this...it's kinda like...uh,"" suddenly she speaks in a language i can't understand, her voice hopeful as if she's waiting for me to say something.   ""forgive me but what language was that?""  her voice turns confused, ""i was speaking english, it's my mother tongue. have you never heard english before?""   i shake my head, before realizing that she cannot see the movement. embarrased i utter a simple ""no."" i've never heard of english in the many years i've been here. though sometimes hermes would bring me items of things in different regions, that was if i had enough dracmae for his payment of course.   ""really? well i'll try my best to explain then.""   another embarrassing realization occurred to me just then, i am being a bad host, i should've invited her for dinner long ago, before i even started my interrogation. shame fills my cheeks as i realize how dull my manners have gotten and before i can stop myself i grab her wrist and promise to listen to her stories once she has eaten.  the story of medusa can wait.  i slowly plate the deer stew i had been simmering earlier, worried about what my guest might think, my mother before me taught me manners when i grew up with her, before i was taken to become a priestess.   while it is true most priestesses choose to become servants of the gods i was one of the few unwilling, those who were born into slavery or whose husbands had grown tired of them and had them sent away.  though of course whilst growing up i was once betrothed to a fair prince of crete, whose beauty was said to surpass achilles himself, narcissus i believe his name was, my father being one of the most prestigious nobles in apollonia, but in his arrogance he didn't pay the proper tribute to athena, almost forgetting her entirely with a meager single calf as her sacrifice, and even apollo, patron god of our city was unable to quell her rage, so to appease the goddess my father forced me to become a priestess.  the memory of getting assigned to polish the statues of the goddess come unbidden in my memory, and i unintentionally squeeze the bread i am getting kore- i mean persephone, to eat her stew with, crumbling the side i am holding, almost dropping the entire loaf.  shame curdles inside of me like spoiled milk and strangles my throat as i choke back the memory of a young girls cries for her mother as a heavy wooden door closes behind her. it was an honor to serve my goddess as long as i did, but bitter resentment throws me occasionally, mainly when i'm stroking chrysaor's hair as he sleeps.   he looks more like his father then, his brow furrowing as his dreams become more lifelike than his reality that his body occupies.  i have prayed countless times after the incident, for my death, for forgiveness, for a second chance. but my goddess never answered.  briseis says something, and i realize belatedly that she's feeling around the table, for a spoon perhaps? it's only then i realize that i have been caught up in my mind for too long.  it's time to pay attention to the blind girl at the end of the table.  i watch briseis as she eats, my eyes mainly resting on her slender hands on habit. it's only when i hear a small clatter, of the spoon being dropped unceremoniously into the bowl that i finally force my eyes to lift higher, but not to her face, to her shoulders only. i am not accustomed to looking anyone in the face.  i do not know where to begin with her, i do not know what to make of the human before me, what to expect, what to brace myself for, or what to tell her if she asks questions.   i have not explained anything to anyone in millennia, not about me or my children or the snakes that slither in my hair and snap at each other for fun.  i do not know what to say as she starts speaking, her voice a waterfall crashing over the smoothened rock below, soft, elegant, and graceful. her milk colored eyes lighting up with excitement as she begins the tale of medusa, the girl with snakes in her hair.  a bitter lump in my throat forms as i hear her speak about the sea god, the one who has hurt me more than others.    he is where my story begins, she is where my story will begin to take a life that is beyond my control, i cannot control my life beyond her words and it is only when she says nothing that the silence breaks over me. i am unable to find the words that will contradict hers, to tell her that what he did to me was not as mutual as she claimed, or that the grey eyed one formed me not from malice or misplaced jealousy but if sorrow and pity.  she could not turn on her kind so she had no choice but to turn on me. and while the words i wish to say stick like thorns in my throat i am unable to dislodge them. perseus, whoever that may have been in my garden of stone, was unsuccessful in his attempt to free my head permanently from my shoulders, no matter what the myth says.  some poet must have pitied him and decided to use his tragic death as the basis of his tale, perhaps unable to cope with the idea that a monster like me was still around after so many ""heroes"" have attempted to rid me.  the dust of the past seemed to have clogged my memory, my dreams becoming fragmented spiderwebs that are unable to let go of the past, in the corner of my eye i see the weathered statue of the last man who had stumbled upon me. his face smoothing out with the dawn of a new era that he will never see. another ghost that will haunt me whenever hades decides that i am finally fit to be one of his subject.  a clatter behind me alerts me to pegasus' presence, who flops his head into my lap to listen to the tale persephone has spun from the depths of her memory. he reacts more than i, snorting disdainfully as he hears the gaudyness of my beheading and how he and chrysaor spring out of my blood into the world. i stroke him absentmindedly, not really paying attention to the story unfolding around me, the story of a monster and a valiant hero who bested it. it's only when she she tells another version do i truly pay attention, this one being of a girl turned monster who is unable to find peace with her life, who becomes a symbol of the abused and provides shelter and aid.  a girl turned into a monster turned into a god.  a girl who is tragic and forgived for the actions she was the root of.  a story of how someone can burn the bridges that were laid by her feet and instead forge a path of gold and silver, a path of redemption.  briseis makes a big show of yawning, covering her mouth a few times before i finally got the hint and shook myself out of the fantasy i was living in.  the night seemed to stretch out before us, the shadows casting their long flickering fingers onto our skin as the candlelight bobbed in and out of existence with the dwindling oil that covered my torches. briseis's head was constantly drooping treacherously near the table and i made pegasus stay with her while i made her a bed, using an old bed frame i myself had carved out of cypress and an old soft linen stuffed with goose feathers.   i tested it out to find that the quills constantly stabbed through the fabric, and decided to gather the various pelts i kept around for the winter to lay it on top, satisfied when i tested it again and found it to be soft.  hurrying towards briseis again i announced that it was time for bed, she nodded sleepily and pegasus took it upon himself to guide her to bed, making sure to steady her when heavy clad feet tripped on cracks in the floor or on the odd stool.   once she was safely into bed i began to clean, keeping as quiet as possible as i took the plates to the stream near my home to rinse them. the moon shown brightly down on me and lit up the field  and stream around me, turning the water a brilliant silver.   humming a song to myself i made my way back inside and put out the torches, smiling to myself when i saw that pegasus was sleeping next to my bed, his gold wing underneath his head while his silver one covered his face, trying to block out the light i presume. i allowed myself to undress and to put out the last torch as sleep took over my body.  i am bathing in a pool of water, the moon high above me soaking into the dark water below, turning the smooth rocks and coarse sand into fine silvery wisps as i lift my feet to swim a bit further out.  my long auburn ringlets flow into the dark water, looking like the red tendrils of an octopus. the trees rustle in the breeze as i feel myself sink into the water, my pale skin flashing in the moonlight like a fish's scales, i rise swiftly when i hear a voice call out, covering myself as little as my hands can before the voice's owner comes into view, a few nymphs have emerged from the trees and with them their mistress, artemis.   fear shoots through me as i try to slip out of the water to avoid being seen, i'm not supposed to be out of the temple. but before i can slide into the trees the nymph calls out again. i turn to look at them when i notice that artemis has disrobed and has stepped into the pool i have been occupying.   i avert my eyes dutifully and stay where i am. i hear her approaching slowly, her movements calm and slow as if she is trying to get close to a skittish animal. with my eyes averted i see her feet as she comes to a stop in front of me, to my surprise they're dirty, with the nails slightly overgrown.  i freeze completely when a soft hand tilts my head up, and no matter how mortal her body may seem there is no doubt in my mind that she is a god. her eyes are pale silver and her face has this otherworldly beauty that would put helen to shame, her hair as dark as ink and when she blinks i can see a crescent moon adorning each eyelid, as well as the middle of her forehead, a silvery sheen that glimmers in the shifting moonlight.  she takes my hand into hers and leads me to the group of awaiting nymphs where they all have begun bathing together, once we reenter the group they seem to loosen up, beginning to laugh and splash each other as the dark droplets turned silver against the brightening moonlight.   one of the nymphs move towards the shore to pick berries from a nearby bush, the dark fruit plump and juicy between her fingers as she tosses it into the goddess's mouth, who catches it laughing, another moves towards a tree to hang up her chiton, when she rushes back into the water screaming.   instantly the others surround the goddess whilst trying to cover their own selves from the figure who suddenly appears from the trees. a hunter who can't take his eyes off the goddess beside me as he hurriedly disrobes and tries to enter the water to reach her. i avert my eyes from were they were starting to go down the man's torso, it is forbidden for me to look at a man in such way, priestesses of athena must remain pure.  the man comes closer and the nymphs press against each other for comfort, snarling like the wolves who often accompany them, trying to keep the man from touching their goddess, who has gone silent the closer the man has gotten. i steal a glance at her and am surprised to see how clearly she wears the rage on her face. she is fierce and beautiful as she glides past the nymphs, standing in front of her assailant who instantly reaches out to touch her most intimate parts.   a hush falls around the nymphs as the man's hand reaches out to squeeze the goddess's breasts, but as soon as his hand lands on her tender skin her hand shoots out to slap him. he curses in frustration and brings his own hand down to strike her, only to grab his head as he seemingly doubles over in pain.  the nymphs surrounding me laugh as he begins to stumble around the water blindly, holding his head in what seems to be agony as the goddess watches him unamused.  i can only watch in mute horror as two antlers sprout from his forehead, his dark skin turning into muted brown fur as his fingers break off like glass shards as he thrashes around trying to get away, only to have the stump of his hand turn into shiny cleaved black hooves.  the stag before me bleats in fear as it tries to swim to shore but the nymphs sing out a song that causes a wolf to answer, and soon another answers it's call and then another and another. one by one they appear, and the stag has no choice but to meet them on the shore, it's unsteady hooves try to get sure footing among the small rocks but as soon as it's fully out of the water the wolves descend on it.  they surround the stag completely, and even though i know what's going to come next i still cannot allow myself to turn away. i watch as one of the wolves trip up the stag by running under its hooves, and another bite into it's hindquarters savagely, ripping away the thin fur to reveal the strong muscle underneath, they begin to tear bits of him off and though the stag tries to fight them off it is no use, a wolf steps onto his head and rips out his throat, a spray of blood misting the air surrounding him, i listen to the last terrified bleats it releases before it's cries become nothing but a gurgle of blood that's pouring out of it's throat.  the nymphs resume their bath but i am frozen to the spot i occupy, even the goddess barely spares a glance at the carnage before her as she joins the rest of her nymphs to finish bathing.   the wolves eat the carcass as the nymphs play in the water and i stare at them dumbly, slightly scared to go near them.   the goddess is done bathing first and as soon as she leaves the nymphs follow and to my surprise one of the grabs my hand and attempts to get me to leave with their group, but i draw back my hand and shake my head firmly, the goddess looks back to me and a sad expression fills her eyes before she leaves my line of sight, leaving me alone once again.  i hurriedly dress and run back to the temple, hoping no one has noticed my absence.  i awake with a start my eyes flying open to meet green ones, chrysaor has been shaking me, his sword in hand, and with hushed tones he speaks of an intruder who has somehow broken in.  i get up quickly, not bothering to cover up my body as my snakes are the last to wake up fully, tasting the air almost lazily as they look for the intruder. with chrysaor behind me i find her. persephone has bundled herself in the old blanket i've given her so only the top of her brown hair could be seen.  chrysaor nudges me and motions to her, trying to tell me that the intruder is the girl sleeping peacefully. i quickly drag him outside to avoid waking her. as soon as we enter the clearing chrysaor plants his feet and crosses his arms, demanding answers.  ""she is a guest in our home and you will not harass her with your sword so put that away!"" i hiss, worried that we might be waking her, above us, on the lip of the cave we inhabit pegasus strolls out and stretches almost like a cat, his wings flashing like coins in the morning sun.   ""why was i not notified then?"" he demands, an annoyed scowl pressing across his face, and for a moment it is like i am looking at his father.   i shake my head to get rid of the ghost that haunts me before i can bring myself to answer.  ""you were asleep, and i was hoping that your brother would have notified you,"" i glare up at where he is trotting down to greet us, his wings ruffling at the sight of me.  as soon as he's near i lightly flick his ear which causes him to snort. i lightly stroke his mane before pressing a kiss on his soft head in greeting.  ""i thought she was trying to hurt us,"" chrysaor mutters, the annoyed expression still plastered on his face.   ""hey,"" i step closer to him and wrap him in my arms, placing a kiss in his dark hair as he sighs against me, ""i did not mean to worry you, i am sorry.""  with another sigh he presses into me, before wrapping his arms around me and burying his face into my chest as my snakes hum contentedly.  i'll have to make it up to him somehow, i know he sees it as his duty to protext us as we do not have a family member who will and he tries his hardest to fill that role, but he is still a young boy, all too eager to grow up.  i pull back from the embrace when i hear his stomach growl and stifle a laugh as he blushes embarrasedly, with that i go over to where the oven is and light a fire using flint and stone.  as it heats up i ask the boys to watch over our guest as i get dressed with a simple tunic and grab my bow from the mouth of the cave and head into the dense underbrush below us.  it is not long before i sight the rabbit, and with one well aimed arrow to the throat it is dead. i skin it quickly, trying to flay it as chrysaor likes, removing its organs as i try to find the tree I'm looking for.  up above me i spot it, hearing the distinct humming sound enacting from the hive where the bees live, and with a heavy sigh i leave my rabbit on the top of a high rock, notching another arrow to shoot down the hive. it plummets and cracks open like an overripe pomegranate and i work quickly to grab a few sticky combs before the bees figure out what it was that attacked them.  a few stings come my way but i try to ignore them and leave as fast as possible, storing the combs in a small container i had the hindsight to bring with me. picking up the remains of the rabbit before i go i practically run from the broken hive before the rest of the bees have the sense to go after me.  before i could head home however i needed to make one more stop, trying to find where the heavy fruit lay among the tall trees, they had to be ripe enough now.   i find the fig tree with some difficulty, going past it twice before i realized that i was stepping on some overripe fruit that has fallen. i set down the rabbit again and bring the container holding the honey comb with me as i climb nearly halfway up the tree trying to pick out the ripest fruit that has yet to fall.  as soon as i gather all that i can i head down again and make my way back to home. before i check if the oven is hot enough i make sure to clean the rabbit properly, removing most of the fat, some of which i place in a container for safe keep and the rest i place in the fourno to liquefy it as i throw in some herbs.   i check on briseis who is still sleeping as i grab the soft dough that i have been making for a few days now and knead it with some of the honey that has gathered at the bottom of the container, deciding to slice up one of the more overripe figs and press it into the dough as well.  as soon as the fruit and honey are incorporated into the dark barley dough i place it in the oven with the herbs, covering it with the dome as i get to work seasoning the rabbit with marjoram, peppercorns that i chop crudely with a knife, and fennel, slicing a bit of another honeycomb to stuff it into the cavity of the creature.  as soon as the bread is done cooking i place the meat into the same bowl the bread once occupied, stepping back as the fat spits up at the new addition.   behind me i hear chrysaor tell briseis where to go to the bathroom, and once understanding that she cannot see offers to take her there. they emerge from the cave where chrysaor is holding onto briseis's arm tightly as he navigates the safest path downwards, calling out a greeting when he spots me.   i smile back and greet our guest by name as they pass me, and i see the question in chrysaor's eyes as he leads her to the stream outside our home. he'saware of the tragedy her name holds, and i do not know how to explain it to him yet.  soon enough the rabbit is done cooking and i put it on a platter alongside the still warm bread, setting up the table with the utensils and plates before i go back to fetch the honeycomb.  surprisingly i bump into chrysaor who explains that he forgot to give persephone the soap so she can wash her hands.  ""she was appalled to have to use the stream.""  ""she has no choice but to get used to it. now hurry back the food will get cold.""  i slice off a large hunk of the bread, drizzling it with honey and a piece of fig before handing it to pegasus who doesn't eat meat.  as i start to serve the others their portions i instruct chrysaor to give eurydice her plate before settling down himself, briseis is standing awkwardly behind him and i grab her hand to make sure she's properly seated, drizzling her bread piece with honey and figs as well.  as soon as chrysaor returns we begin to eat and he smiles with delight when he sees the figs on the table and the bread. taking a large chunk of honeycomb and splitting it with his brother.   i sit back slight as i eat, enjoying the warm rabbit and bread as i watch my sons and briseis eat, who all say thank you when they've finished.  all in all it was a good morning.";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
47019253;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Heracles unbinds Prometheus and talks with him.  I had a dream. I was removed from the crag and was lying on the ground in a curled position, feeling some pleasant warmth on my face and stomach. But a part of me was still awake and conscious, and knew it was just a dream. Maybe the warmth was real, from the sun, though if so, it was unusually strong for such an early spring. But the changed position was an illusion, and I knew that if I tried to move my body or any limb, the chains would cut into my wounds and would add new sharp pain to the background pain that was always with me. Strangely, the background pain had changed its pattern. It had subsided where I felt it in recent times, and instead had reappeared in my hand and feet that had become numb decades ago.  Then I smelled smoke, smoke of raw wood. This made me open my eyes. I saw that I was indeed lying on the ground on my left side, and a fire of juniper branches was burning - and smoking - in front of me. More junipers were growing around. What a strange hallucination! I looked at my body. It was covered by a blanket. My arms were curled rather than stretched, and the chains were attached to the wrists but their other ends were lying on the ground. Nothing made any sense, yet it looked and felt increasingly real. It seemed I was truly free after all, though it defied explanation.  And then someone came, carrying more juniper branches. Heracles! I finally understood. He had returned and rescued me. And because there was no one else in sight, he had most likely done it of his own accord, notwithstanding the will of Zeus.  He left his load on the ground and added two of the branches to the fire. I called his name and he turned to me.  'You are awake, hurrah!' he rejoiced. 'I feared you could never wake up.'  'You took me down from the crag?'  'Exactly. I hid and waited until Hermes cleared the terrain, then climbed back and finished the job.' He added with pride, 'I hate doing things halfway.'  'Immense thanks but... You shouldn't have done it. You took too great a risk.'  'Come what may. Nobody needs me anymore, and nobody will weep for me anyway.' After a moment, he corrected himself: 'Only my old mother.'  Then I realized something that hit me like a heavy object.  'Heracles!' I appealed. 'You must return to the crag and bring a piece of it, now! Because Zeus has sworn to keep me chained to it. If he breaks his oath, he will suffer terribly, and will punish you terribly.'  'So we need a piece of that crag here next to you, to pretend you are still on it?'  'Yes!'  'Relax, then! We have it.' Heracles poked into his backpack and brough out a piece of rock. From this angle, it vaguely resembled the hand axes of the Ants. 'I took it because it brought me luck.'  'It really did,' I agreed with a sigh of relief.  'I first tried to pull the chains out of the rock but they didn't even shake. Then I took a hammer that I had brought for this purpose, and tried to break them. But the hammer slipped out of my hand and fell down into the precipice. It was impossible to retrieve it, so I broke this piece from the rock to use it instead. Only then did I see that in each chain, one link was yellowish. I hit on these links, and each of them shattered after the first stroke. But I was afraid when you didn't even wake up. I feared that I'd come too late.'  'So you brought me to - where are we?'  'Somewhere in the mountain, that's all I can say. I walked down the path I came for about three hours, to reach the juniper shrubbery so I could kindle a fire and build a shelter for the night.'  Relaxed, I looked at the snow covering the ground outside the warm circle around the fire.  'Could you please melt a little snow?' I asked. 'Or just put some into my mouth? I'm thirsty.'  'You drink water?' Heracles was surprised. 'I thought you drink only nectar, and eat ambrosia.'  'We eat and drink like you. That's why I divided the ox.'  He brought to my mouth a small pot full of water which tasted like melted snow. After I drank, he said:  'Do you want to eat? I have bread.'  'Yes, please!'  'I also have olives but I am not sure you should eat them. They are a heavy food.'  'You are right but may I see them? I've never seen olives. They appeared after I was bound here.'  'Here they are. Look, these ones are still on twigs with leaves. And here is the bread.' Heracles brought out a piece, broke it into morsels and put one into my mouth. He said:  'I see that you've had nothing to eat and drink for a long time.'  'The Erinyes came and brought me food and water but it was never enough.'  'The Erinyes? It's good that they fed you but... they aren't a good company, are they?'  'No, they aren't.'  'They come also to me when I unintentionally kill someone... to torment me. But I tell them, if they can return the dead to life, they are welcome, if not, to go away.'  He fed me a little more bread. Its taste awakened old memories and I shared them:  'We sowed barley with my human friends once but then the flood destroyed it. How have you obtained it after the flood?'  'Demeter gave it to Triptolemus of Eleusis.'  'I am glad that other gods also help the humans now. Back then, nobody approved my deed. Many begged Zeus to relent and punish me less severely. But nobody disputed that I deserved a punishment because I had bestowed honors upon mortal creatures beyond their due. Such were the times... Even the gods barely remember them, and for the humans, it must be forgotten prehistory. But for me, it was like yesterday, because then I was bound here, and my real life was over...'  I stopped talking, ashamed of complaining so much. Heracles said:  'I cut off your hair and beard, for they were hopeless. I saw a wound on the back of your head but it's not deep - apparently not from the bird's beak.'  'I banged my head into the rock,' I admitted.  'You tried to kill yourself?'  'No, just couldn't help doing it when the bird...'  'Well, it's over. Do you think they will check on you and find out that you are gone?'  I considered the question and the more I thought of it, the less likely it seemed that Zeus would really let me alone in eternal sleep.  'I think they will,' I said. 'I think that Zeus will be unhappy that Hermes has botched the negotiations, and will try again. Let's think what you'll say when they return.'  'Well, the way they were treating you, immortality or not, you would very soon be unable to negotiate, so they should be thankful to me. And with this fire, it's not like we are hiding. But I think you must say that damned secret.'  'I don't know,' I admitted.  'Why? Are you worrying about Chiron? Believe me, he suffers unbearably and longs for death. He would have already stopped eating ambrosia but he still has some pupils and wants to complete teaching them.'  'I don't want to uphold Zeus' power... after all he did, and all he can do.'  'What exactly can he do?'  'I wish I knew!'  'You talked about me as if you knew everything that has happened and will happen. But now you say that you don't know what Zeus intends.'  'I know some things from the past and future but not all. In fact, very little. Tell me about yourself!'  'I was born in Thebes, the city with the seven-gated fortress...'  'What is a city?' I asked, leaving ""fortress"" aside. I was sure that these were not words that I had forgotten but rather words I had never known.  'A large settlement. How was it called back in your time?'  'At my time, there were no such things. Sorry that I interrupted you.'  'I had to become king of Mycenae but Hera made my aunt give birth prematurely, so my cousin Eurystheus was born before me and became king...'  'I think she did you a favor. Being a king is dirty work.'  'But it was my birthright! And she has harmed me more. When I was eight months old, she put two large snakes into my cradle to strangulate me, but I killed them instead. I am very strong. But I cannot control myself, and I don't think very well. As I told you, I never learned reading and writing. As a boy, I had a tutor for some time. But I got angry at him, unwittingly hit him on the head too hard and killed him. Then no one wanted to teach me. When I grew up, I did a favor to Creon the ruler of Thebes, and he gave me his daughter Megara to be my wife. She bore me three wonderful sons. And then great misfortune struck me...'  Heracles made a pause and swallowed several times before continuing:  'Because Hera with her intrigues had made my cousin Eurystheus king, I had to serve him. But he is a good-for-nothing scoundrel. You cannot imagine how I felt!'  I could imagine it very well but said nothing because I didn't want to interrupt him again.  'He hadn't sought me for years and I hoped that he didn't need me anymore and would leave me alone. But I was wrong. Exactly when I had finally managed my own life and was happy, he sent me a message to report to him so that he would give me tasks. Then madness overwhelmed me... It seemed to me that my eldest nephew Iolaus was Eurystheus, and his two younger brothers... and my own children... were his sons. And I rushed to kill them... Iolaus escaped but I killed the five children... Have you any loved ones - a wife, relatives?'  'I had. I had a wife, three brothers, parents. I had also a son and a daughter but they were mortal, and died long ago.'  'But the others aren't mortal, are they? Why do you talk as if they are also dead?'  'Hermes said that they have written me off. But I am not sure now that this is entirely true. I know it's true about my eldest brother Atlas. Maybe about my youngest brother as well. But I wonder why Hermes and the Erinyes didn't tell me earlier. They are always happy to bring me bad tidings.'  'So Hermes told you that your loved ones no longer love you, and you decided to sleep. I felt the same when I came back to my senses. Do you remember what Hermes said - that mad people should not live? I also thought that it's better for those like me to die. I intended to kill myself but my friend Theseus stopped me. He told me that Hera has most likely afflicted me with madness...'  'Yes, she has, and also Zeus before her.'  'My father? But why?'  'I mean you have inherited dangerous things from him. Look at me - would he do such things if he were sane? And some of his sons skin or tear apart alive people they don't like. Good that Theseus happened to be there. What happened then?'  'I consulted the Oracle of Delphi. The priestess told me to go to Eurystheus and offer him my services, and he'd order me to perform ten Labors to atone for my deed. Since then, I've been busy with these tasks. I have in fact already performed ten Labors but he dismissed two of them. He had sent me to kill a monster called Hydra. It was lurking near the city of Lerna and eating the travelers. It had nine heads, eight mortal and one immortal in the middle. I started removing them but as soon as I chopped one off, two new ones grew in its place. I called Iolaus to help me and while I was cutting the heads, he burned their places so that they wouldn't grow anymore. So we killed the Lernaean Hydra, except its immortal head which we couldn't kill and I buried it deep under a crag. But when I returned, Eurystheus said that he wouldn't count this Labor because Iolaus had helped me. The other one he didn't count was the cleaning up of king Augeas' stables because I had received payment for it. That's why I still have two Labors left: the one in Hesperia and the one that you say will be in Hades, and they will be twelve totally. After I killed the Hydra, I immersed my arrows in its poisonous bloud. Since then, everybody pierced by these arrows dies in extreme pain. This is how I unfortunately injured my friend Chiron. I was aiming at another centaur but hit him. He has suffered ever since but as long as he eats ambrosia, he will not die.'  'Let me repeat: in such an accident, immediately immerse the injured body part in hot water. Remember this!' I said. I had a foreboding that such an accident would happen to Heracles himself.  'Between the Labors, I do some other things,' he continued. 'Upon returning from the tenth Labor, I was invited to an expedition to Colchis to seek a golden fleece. We were fifty, and sailed on a ship named Argo. We crossed the Euxine.' Heracles said ""Euxine"" quite clearly and confidently, so I realized that the name of the sea had changed. 'When we were already close to Colchis, we disembarked on the shore. One of us got lost, and we made a search party but never found him. His name was Hylas, and he was a very good friend of mine. I suppose that the poor one has fallen and died somewhere in the wilderness.'  'The water nymphs have liked him and lured him,' I chimed in. I preferred not to reveal that they had unintentionally drowned him.  'I hope he is well,' replied Heracles, apparently doubting it. 'After searching long in vain, I despaired. At that moment, Iris appeared to me. It was like a dream but was no dream. She smiled and was very polite. She told me to give up everything else and go rescue you from the eagle. So I left my companions and came here. I wandered for a long time, for the Caucasus is a wilderness without tracks. I wished I had a flying device like that which Daedalus built to escape from Crete. Though maybe it was better that I hadn't, because his son Icarus fell and died. It was exactly me who found and buried the body, and it was horrible to behold...'  I was stunned. I supposed that the flying device constructed by Daedalus had been engineless but it was still hard to believe that the humans who hadn't yet mastered the iron were already trying to travel by air.  'When I would lose myself totally, someone left signs for me,' said Heracles. 'Nevertheless, I already feared that I wouldn't find you and would just wander until I'd run out of food and die. However, two days ago at dawn, I heard someone cry - was this you?'  'Yes, it was me. I tried to endure in silence but couldn't.'  'And it was good that you couldn't, because I heard you and finally found you. I'd shoot that disgusting bird even if they hadn't told me. I wouldn't stand by and watch it eat you alive. Then I considered my job done, and intended to leave. But as I turned my back, I realized that Hermes had not actually promised me that they'd set you free from your bonds, and I was afraid for you. So I hid and then returned to rescue you. Now, I have my peace of mind, and this is most important. Besides, as I said, I have no children to support anymore. I have only Megara. She forgave me but I have the feeling that she'd be happier without me. She is now living in Tiryns, where my mother is from, and I visit her whenever I can. We had to leave Thebes, of course.'  I had a feeling now that Heracles would get away with releasing me, and I voiced it:  'Methinks you have nothing to be afraid of now. And generally you can cope with almost any difficulty coming from without. The real perils for you are the fits of rage and madness coming from within. They cost the life of whoever happens to be around, guilty or not. Why did you want to kill Eurystheus' children? You must learn to control yourself. Count to fifty before raising your hand against someone!'  As I expected, Heracles didn't like my words. Rage distorted his face, and he raised his right hand as if to hit me.  'This is exactly what I mean,' I added. Heracles slowly pulled his hand down.  'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I can't control myself. This is the curse of my life.'  'It's all right, but be careful not to kill anymore. And as I already said, part ways with Megara! She has forgiven you but you mustn't live together anymore. No marriage can survive what happened.'  'But how can I leave her alone and without protection?'  'Don't leave her alone, give her as wife to someone trustworthy! I think Iolaus is the best. He is good-hearted, and they'll love each other.'     Heracles added juniper branches into the fire and asked:  'Now, if you aren't too exhausted, would you tell me your story? Why did you and my father become enemies? How did you decide to give us fire? And is it true that you have created the humans?'  I remained silent for a moment to collect my thoughts, wondering where to begin. Then I began my tale at random:  'This was the third human generation. Athena, Hephaestus and I created it, following your father's order. Otherwise, none of us would think of it, let alone dare do it. Zeus was far-sighted. He had figured out that sentient mortal beings, similar to us, were needed. But when we created them, he didn't like them. He wanted to bring the whole race to an end and create a new one in its place, more to his liking. I disagreed. You asked why we became enemies. After all, I supported him in his revolt against Cronus. I stood against most of my family...'  'You mean the War of the Titans?'  'Yes.'  'I have wondered why after it, Zeus imprisoned the other titans but left you free. Why did you side with him?'  'Because of stupidity. I was young and thought that if we topple to old tyrant, everything would be fine. However, once enthroned, Zeus started doing things I found wrong. I objected, and we started to dislike each other. But we truly quarreled over the humans. I befriended some of them. And my son would be like them. But they had nothing, and Zeus wanted them never to have anything. You talk about cities, ships and flying devices. The humans of my time had only dreams of food, warmth and shelter. We met with their chiefs at a place named Mecone - do you know it?'  'In Peloponnese, close to the isthmus?' asked Heracles.  'Yes, it was close to the isthmus,' I confirmed, though I had never before heard the name Peloponnese.  'I have heard that this is the old name of the place where today is the city of Sicyon.'  'At Mecone, Zeus ordered me to show how to do a sacrifice. I made a trick so that the meat remained for the humans, and the gods ended up with the bones. We actually had our own flocks and didn't need the human ones. However, your father got quite angry, and forbade us to give fire to the humans. I gave them whatever else I could but without fire, nothing was of much use. The winter was disastrous for them, their children were dying of cold. And when Zeus forbade me to meet them anymore, I went for one last time and showed them how to kindle fire by friction...'  'Really? Our tradition says that you have stolen a firebrand from Zeus' hearth, or from Hephaestus' forge, or from Helios' chariot.'  'Nonsense! I had my own hearth but why carry around firebrands so that everyone would see me? And I had to learn the humans to kindle fire themselves anyway. Your father considered the fire his property, like everything else. That's why he said I had stolen it. However, I thought that the fire belongs to everyone. And I still think so.'  'Some say that my father actually wanted you to give us fire.'  'They may well be right. But his intention wasn't good. I think he set a trap for me, and I stepped into it and dragged the humans as well. Your father was seeking an excuse to deal with them and with me, and I gave him one. At my trial, he said: ""Son of Iapetus, surpassing all in cunning, you are glad that you have outwitted me and stolen fire - a great plague to you yourself and to men that shall be. But I will give men as the price for fire an evil thing, their own destruction."" And he laughed. Yes, he laughed. I had foreseen my fate but too late did I see what he'd do to the humans. Do you know what happened then? Have you heard of Pandora and her... box?' I couldn't remember the word ""jar"".  'I know nothing about the box but have heard of Pandora. That she was the first mortal woman, sent to the human race as a punishment. Was it truly so? It makes Megara angry that just because Pandora was bad, all women are blamed.'  'She wasn't bad, just curious. And she wasn't the first mortal woman. Zeus decided to use my feeble-minded brother Epimetheus to hurt the humans. He made the Olympians adorn Pandora, placed a jar full of contagious diseases into her hands, and sent her to become my brother's wife. I had warned him to accept nothing from Zeus, but he had no sense. So women are blamed just because I happened to have a feeble-minded brother rather than a sister.'  'But people also say that Pandora gave us hope,' remarked Heracles.  'It's true. She gave birth to Pyrrha, and I don't think Deucalion would have coped without Pyrrha. But before hope, Pandora gave diseases - because she opened the box, of course. So outbreaks afflicted the humans, and their numbers plummeted. But some withstood the diseases. Zeus saw that he wouldn't get rid of mankind so easily, and made a flood. This was thirty years after the so-called theft of fire...'  'I have heard that he ordered the flood because humans succumbed to evil.'  'They say so to whitewash Zeus. In fact, he had decided to destroy the humans, be they good and bad. But it's true that after Pandora's box, many were ruined inside and resorted to evil. They would blame some unfortunate man for bringing disease, and kill him on the spot. But the worst thing was that they stopped worshipping the gods. As a result, most gods agreed with Zeus that this generation of humans had to be wiped out from the face of the Earth and be replaced with another, allegedly better. A crazy chief named Lycaon tipped the balance. He sacrificed a boy to Zeus, thinking - with some logic - that Olympians wanted human sacrifices. Your father used this as an excuse to flood the lands populated by humans. Only my son Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha survived. I had warned them about the flood, and they built a chest. They were offspring of gods, so Zeus didn't dare to kill them...'  'You mean Deucalion who survived the flood, wanted new humans and became ruler of Thessaly! I have heard of him of course but I didn't know he was your son.'  'My descendants leave out this awkward detail,' I admitted. 'They prefer to point out that they derive from Zeus, which is also true because he raped Pyrrha and her daughters and begat children with them. Anyway, mankind had a new start, and most diseases brought by Pandora disappeared with the flood - at least for the time being. But back then, I couldn't find anything positive. I regretted my deeds, because however wretched the life of humans in the Stone Age was, my intervention brought their demise.'  'Did you tell anyone of your regret?'  'No, I didn't.' Heracles smiled, satisfied. 'You are the first to hear about it. But I said a lot of other things. Most importantly, I uttered the prophecy that a particular woman, if raped by Zeus, would give birth to a son stronger than him. But I haven't said her name to this day, and I don't intend to.'  'I think that you must.'  'Heracles, your father killed off my friends, tortured me until I turned into a shadow of my former self, and made the pettiest revenge possible by raping my daughter in-law and my granddaughters! And you say I must give him what he wants?'  'About the latter, I don't even think it was revenge,' said Heracles. 'It seems that my father rapes anything that moves. No one of my family has ever rebelled against him, yet he forced himself on my mother Alcmene, and this is how I was conceived. People say that he is very good, but I am a living proof that he isn't, for if he was, I wouldn't exist at all! Unless we say that whatever he does is good, but this makes no sense.'  'Excellent argument!' I admitted. 'But please don't say it to others.'  'I won't.'  'And don't pursue one woman after another like him. He can do whatever he wants because he makes others pay for his mistakes. But if you do the same, you'll suffer terribly, and will die early. So let me repeat, it's the best for you not to marry again, but if you really need a woman, choose one and be loyal to her.'  'I'd wish to do so, but as I said, I cannot control myself. I take after my father in this. So I'll follow my fate. I am doomed to die anyway. I am not immortal, no matter how much I wish to be. I have heard that my father has grabbed some boy from Phrygia, made him his cupbearer and given him immortality, but he has no intention to bestow the same gift on me, his own son.'  I had a reasonable guess that the Phrygian boy was wanted for services other than cupbearing, which Heracles couldn't perform exactly because he was Zeus' son. I didn't voice it, just asked:  'Do you wish to be immortal?'  'Of course I do! I know it's impossible but I still wish it. And though I suffered greatly after I killed my sons and nephews, I am glad that Theseus didn't let me die. I can challenge death, and I have done it many times, but I still think nothing is worse than it!'  I just nodded, though I knew that worse than death was wishing for it in vain. Heracles returned to the previous subject:  'And I fear that if you don't reveal the secret, this would mean death for many of us. Because, when the stronger son comes, the first thing he'll do will be a big war in our lands. And then, if any humans have remained, he may wish to clear them. My father for all his faults has already put up with the existence of humans.'  'You are right here,' I admitted, 'though Zeus still kindles stupid wars among humans.'  'It seems that his power has diminished,' coucluded Heracles and asked a surprising question: 'Do you know if he's still Thunderer?'  'What makes you doubt it?'  'I have a friend named Admetus, he rules over Pherae. Do you know what happened to him?'  'No, I don't, please tell me!'  'Admetus had as a servant Apollo himself for an entire year! But let me begin from the beginning. Some time ago, Apollo fell in love with a mortal woman named Coronis, and begat a child. But she cheated on him because she didn't love him, she loved a man. Apollo found out and shot her, or sent Artemis to shoot her - I am not sure what exactly happened. Anyway, Coronis was killed, together with many poor people who just happened to be nearby...'  'Typical.'  'And she was about to give birth. Apollo cut her womb open and brought out his son alive. He named him Asclepius and gave him to Chiron for upbringing. Apollo hoped that his son would befriend gods and be given immortality. Instead, Asclepius wished to help humans. He became a great healer, some say better than his father. He cured many who were considered doomed. But once he brought back to life a man hit by Zeus' thunderbolt, and my father got angry. He killed the man again, and then killed Asclepius with another thunderbolt. Apollo was enraged, and avenged his son by shooting the Cyclopes who had forged the thunderbolt. Zeus relented and revived Asclepius but ordered Apollo to become a mortal's servant for a year as a punishment. This is why he had to serve Admetus. When I heard of this, I thought that with the Cyclopes dead, there would be no more thunderbolts. However, they didn't even diminish.'  What news! It was good that I was lying, for I felt my world turning upside down. And Heracles was relating it quite an everyday manner - apparently his imagination wasn't too lively. I could now understand why my mention of Leto had enraged Hermes so much.  'The thunderbolt was both a weapon and a natural phenomenon,' I explained. 'The natural phenomenon will remain. However, only the Cyclopes knew how to make the weapon, so it will come to an end. However, don't tell the humans about it! They will grow overconfident, and Zeus may still be Thunderer for some time because he is likely to have dozens of stored thunderbolts. Moreover, he has other weapons as well.'  'But he is going to lose this particular weapon sooner or later, isn't he?'  'If the Cyclopes are truly dead, then yes, he is.'  'Then I suppose that, knowing that he won't be as dangerous anymore, you can accept his power and have your life back.'  'Not much has remained of it...'  'Whatever has remained. So tell that damn secret! You'll do a favor to yourself and everyone else. Including the lady. Whoever she is, I don't think she'd want my father in her bed. My mother didn't.'  'Yes, she definitely wouldn't want him.'  'So reveal it! Just take care that my father doesn't deceive you. Don't rely on his mercy!'  'Of course I won't. I know Zeus' mercy. Its key quality is its absence.'  I felt that Hermes would return any moment, and told Heracles about it:  'Please add green branches to the fire to produce smoke. Hermes will soon come, and will wonder where I am.'  'I wish I hadn't to deliver you to my father, and return to serve that wretch Eurystheus.'  'Once I am out of here, I'll be safe. And you do a good job ridding the forests and the see from monsters, the result of irresponsible experiments. Try to look at Eurystheus' funny side. I can see him trembling behind the walls of Mycenae, daring not show his nose...'  'Whenever I bring him something truly interesting, he hides in a large jar.'  'I wish to see him when you bring him Cerberus! Now call Hermes, for he is already circling above the crag and wondering.'  Hermes returns and negotiates with Prometheus.  Heracles stood up, waived his hands over his head and cried out:  'Here, here! We are here!' The knife with which he had cut the juniper shone in his right hand. He turned to Prometheus and said in a low voice: 'What a fool I must look like, pointing a knife at the sky!'  'In such cases, we usually hold a knife. Maybe it gives us confidence,' I said.  A dot in the sky started enlarging. It soon turned into a flying cart which landed on the slope. Hermes and Hephaestus stepped out of it and approached.  'So Prometheus talked you into releasing him after all, didn't he?' sneered Hermes to Heracles.  'So what if he's released me?' I asked. 'If the negotiations fail, you'll bind me again.'  'You must stay bound to the crag all the time!'  'I am. The stone next to me is from the crag.'  'Prometheus hasn't talked me into anything,' clarified Heracles. 'When I wrapped him in a cloak, I touched him, and he was cold as a corpse. He was quite unwell, and I didn't think you'd leave him there. But I still checked, and I found you gone and him unconscious. If I hadn't released and warmed him, I doubt he'd be able to speak with you now.'  'I had to bring the cart,' said Hermes. 'Did Prometheus badmouth your father in front of you?'  'He said that it was thanks to my father that humans came to exist,' replied Heracles with resourcefulness that surprised me. Then Hermes turned to me:  'And you, Prometheus, dare not speak of negotiations! This is arrogance. The father of gods and men cannot negotiate with a wretch like you.'  'Oh he can. He wants something from me and I want something from him, so we'll negotiate. This is why you're here after all.'  'Hail Heracles! You've done my job, and done it quite well!' exclaimed Hephaestus joyously. He approached me, bent down and asked:  'Why are you lying, have you broken bones?' and added quietly so that Hermes wouldn't hear him, 'Don't tell the secret until he promises you freedom!'  'I am just injured and exhausted,' I replied and winked to show that I had understood. He was my dear friend as before, and I wouldn't let anything come between us.  'No personal conversations!' Hermes interrupted us and also approached me. 'Father Zeus said that you must first divulge the secret and only then be unbound. But if you are reasonable and don't fall back to your old obstinacy, it won't matter which one has been first. Come on! All I want from you is a name.'  'And what about my conditions?'  'The titans are already free, as Arce has told you.'  'And the humans?'  'Zeus needn't promise anything about the humans. He has changed his attitude to them. He doesn't want anymore to wipe them out and replace them with a better race.'  'This is already impossible anyway,' I pointed out.  'Of course, he removes individual humans.'  'Only individuals?'  'Well, also groups that become too evil or too proud.'  'Only in such cases?'  'Or if they become too numerous,' reluctantly admitted Hermes and cast a quick glance at Heracles to see how the member of the human race felt about this discussion. The hero was admiring the mountain peaks and seemed quite uninterested in the negotiations.  'So be it,' I said. 'Then I only want Zeus to give me back my freedom.'  'Unthinkable! You are a criminal who doesn't deserve freedom, and when you were free, you kept making epic messes. But you'll receive the treatment you need, and you'll be treated well. If you behave well, you may even have visitations from time to time.'  'It had to be so from the beginning. But after everything I endured, now I want freedom. Not to be locked up and the key be thrown away.'  'You cannot demand to walk free around Olympus and disturb the Thunderer! This is simply not serious!'  'If Father Zeus doesn't want Prometheus on Olympus, let him stay with us,' chimed in Heracles. 'I'll bring him to Colchis, it's a barbarian city but is well managed and must have good healers. When he gets better, I can take him home in Tiryns. Or he may settle in Athens. My friend Theseus who rules there wants to increase literacy and meets with open arms anyone who can read.'  Heracles' expression was quite innocent though he would later admit that he was trying to catch Hermes at his word.  'Unthinkable!' shouted Hermes again. 'Prometheus among the humans again, may the Moirae save us from this!' Then he turned to me: 'Have you learned nothing during all these years? If you had admitted your fault and had repented, your lot would have been far better. But no, you want Zeus to release you while still behaving as his enemy.'  'On the contrary, I was very loyal,' I said. 'I revealed right away that the danger would come from a new union. If I hadn't warned him, Zeus would have laid with that maiden long ago, and would fall from his... high chair. But now, to keep his power, it's enough to stick to Hera and all the other ladies he already has, plus the boy he has abducted from Phrygia. As long as he rules over himself, he'll rule over the world...'  'Watch your tongue! And if you don't want new torture, don't mention Ganymede!'  'I'm just describing the situation. Unless Zeus accepts my condition, he won't learn the secret. You know that when I want, I talk free, and when I don't want, nobody can force me. Time passes, and some wonderful day Zeus will be unable to restrain himself. An adversary will he prepare despite himself, a prodigy irresistible, even one who shall discover a flame mightier than the lightning and a deafening crash to outroar the thunder. Then, wrecked upon this evil, Zeus shall learn how different it is to be a sovereign and a slave.'  'Nonsense! The life span of our progeny is ever shortening. Zeus need not fear his son who will not be immortal. He demands the name from you just as a formality and a proof that you have been reformed.'  'Oh yes, his son will not be truly immortal. But our previous succession war lasted only ten years. Even ordinary humans live much longer. So I don't believe that it's just a formality. If so, why does Zeus recently lay only with Hera and mortal women... and with that boy?'  Hermes couldn't find an answer. I continued:  'Right now, Zeus seems more eager to keep me here than to learn the secret. But he'll change his mind, and will send you to me again. Today, Heracles barely brought me back to my senses. Next time, I may be unable to tell the name, even if I want to. I lose ever more words. Maybe I won't remember even my own name. And Zeus will blame you. You know that he always blames others for his mistakes.'  'This is nonsense! You are immortal.'  'My liver is immortal but my brain isn't. You said yourself that I am becoming like Epimetheus.'  Hermes was lost for words again. Then Hephaestus turned to him:  'Why don't you agree? You know that we all want Prometheus to return. I bet that even you want it. Why don't you promise him freedom on Zeus' behalf?'  'So be it,' Hermes sighed. 'He'll be free within the confines of Olympus.'  'And promise that Zeus won't hurt the maiden!' I added.  'Stop these offensive hints!'  'This is no hint. I remember what happened to Metis!'  'All right. I promise that Zeus won't hurt her.'  'Swear an oath!' I insisted. Hermes reluctantly swore and added:  'But you will not be acquitted. You are just a pardoned criminal, and will wear an ivy wreath in place of your chains, to differ from the rest and to remember your punishment.' Saying this, he took out a wreath.  'I refuse to admit guilt in this way!' I said and turned to Heracles with indignation: 'The inferior ones on Olympus wear ivy leaves, and they want to put an entire wreath on me!'  'Why do you care? It causes no pain, does it?' remarked Heracles. 'If you don't repent in words, others may think whatever they want. And we can bear wreaths in you honor.' Heracles brought out from his bag the olive branches and put them on his head in some crude resemblance of a wreath. Then he took the ivy wreath from Hermes and placed it on my head. This time, I did not object.  'Now, say her name,' said Hermes. However, I stayed silent. I felt that if I said it, something bad would happen, though I didn't yet know what exactly. Anxiety grew until finally Hephaestus spoke:  'Say it at last so that we can go home! Have you grown attached to the Caucasus? If you don't think of yourself, think of Pronoia! She has been inconsolable ever since you were bound here. She became gaunt and her eyes shine no more. Without you, there is no life for her!'  Something tore inside me. I turned to Hermes and sneered:  'Liar!'  'I haven't lied to you! I only said that Pronoia lives in Hephaestus' home and he has remarried! This is true, and it's no fault of mine if you have misunderstood me.'  Hephaestus and Heracles were watching us in dismay. Hermes admitted what it was about. Heracles cast an admonishing look while Hephaestus laughed and explained to me:  'We parted ways with Aphrodite and I married Aglaia, and Pronoia lives with us. This is the truth.' Then he turned to Hermes: 'Aren't you tired of all these lies? You deserve Prometheus to tear off your head! And I'll help him.'  'All right, but let him first say the name.'  I still had the dark foreboding but I wanted to live again, to return to Pronoia. I took a breath and said:  'Thetis.'  'Really?' exclaimed Hermes in disbelief. 'Of all goddesses and nymphs, exactly Thetis! It's hard to believe. Too convenient. Can you swear?'  'I swear by Styx that it's Thetis!'  'So it must be true after all. Father Zeus will be disappointed, for he hasn't given up on Thetis. He intended to take her as soon as you would confirm that it was not her.'  'Let him take her, why not!' Heracles said merrily. 'If he wishes her so much... I'd always prefer a beautiful maiden to a kingdom!'  'It won't get to this. He'll most likely give her as wife to some mortal.'  I immediately realized that, though Thetis herself had proposed this long ago, it was exactly the evil I had foreseen. She had escaped a trouble just to be afflicted by another one, and it was my fault. Alas, it was too late to swallow my words or to set a condition that Thetis does not suffer a forced marriage. I only said:  'No need to.'  'Now that Prometheus has revealed the secret, you'll return him to his wife, won't you? And you'll treat him well?' asked Heracles.  'Yes, we will,' replied Hermes and nodded.  'I am very glad! I knew that we could rely on the mercy and wisdom of Father Zeus! Prometheus cannot walk, may I carry him to your cart?'  'Yes, please! Prometheus, bid your rescuer farewell and let's go,' said Hermes.  Heracles lifted me, carried me to the cart and placed me on the back seat, then handed the stone to Hephaestus. I was so exhausted that couldn't even say farewell. I remember that Hephaestus, who was sitting next to me, was poking me and shouting: ""Don't fall asleep! Apollo said you shouldn't!"" but it was in vain. I fell asleep deeply, or maybe I fainted again.";;;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
