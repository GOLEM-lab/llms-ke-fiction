17464;"""You watch when Achilles strikes your brother down, watch your brother's glorious form fall under the wrath of a goddess's son, and you can almost hear your brother telling you again that he hates you, that you are the reason he won't live to see the sun set this day.""";narrator;second;Hector;Hector;;;;;Achilles;Achilles;;;;;slaying;death;;;;;"You cannot sleep. You lie in your extravagant bed alone, you, Alexandros, the fairest man this side of the Aegean Sea. Helen has not touched you in years; she hates you for taking her away from Menelaus. You don't love her, either.  He presses heavily against you, tan fingers digging into your golden thighs, and you can almost see the purple bruises that will appear the next morning. You try to touch him, but he only bats your hands away before clutching your thighs again.  ""I hate you,"" he tells you  You only ever loved him. You never loved Oenone or Helen...only him. You think you should have stuck with one of them, probably Oenone since she loved you, because neither of them are your brother, and that makes all the difference  and you know he doesn't, you know he loves you. Everyone loves you, or loved, anyway, except for Cassandra, and he is no exception. He welcomed you when you first appeared at the palace in your shepherd drags, and even when you brought Helen back and earned yourself disapproval from some, he never did anything but love you and support you.  The only difference with him is that you love him back  because only your brother can hurt you this much. Sometimes, you wish you never fell in love with Hector.  His widow is still in mourning, but you, who love him the most, received your entire share when the funeral games ended. You are the only person left to command the army, and you wish you fought more when Hector was still alive  and you know he knows that as well. He continues.  ""I hate you for foolishly bringing Helen to Ilium just because Aphrodite promised her to you. I hate you for charming me so much that I didn't force you to take Helen back to Sparta so that she won't bring war upon us. I hate you for turning to me when she abandoned you. I hate you for making me love you so that I can't hate you,"" he utters lowly, sliding into you faster and rougher, and you know now that he isn't lying, that he loves you but hates you at the same time.  ""I can't believe I'll die because of you,"" he growls  instead of charming your way out of everything in order to live a life of idleness and luxury. But you still had Helen then, and by the time you lost her, no one came to ask you to fight anymore. They all still loved you, of course, because you are Paris, but Hector was the only one who really cared about you. At least, he was the only one who actually came to you when Helen left you.  And now, you have no one. You don't have Oenone or Helen and especially not the only person you ever loved, and you think that maybe you deserve all this because it is your fault, anyway, that any of this happened. You caused everything, so you really shouldn't be surprised that you would lose in the process as well, even with Aphrodite's protection.  and you arch up into him as he says, ""Because I killed Patroclus, Achilles won't let me live."" With one last thrust, you are coming, and he says then, ""I won't live to see tomorrow night. All because you made me too weak to order the return of Helen,"" and when you finally regain enough senses to open your mouth in protest, he covers it brutally with his own.  He releases you with the taste of blood in your mouth, and he tells you, ""Never again, Paris. You can't charm me anymore."" He turns away from you, and though you reach for him, he doesn't see. He doesn't want to see.  He doesn't turn back, just dresses himself and leaves you by yourself in your bed, and you think that maybe he doesn't know that you love him, after all, that you are in love with him.  You finally manage to sleep a few hours before a servant awakens you, and when you dismiss him, you gaze at the armor laid before you, the armor that you must wear now that your brother is gone. You touch each piece and wonder how your brother felt, sweating under them in the sun, blood staining the shining metal plates.  You put your armor on slowly, and when you finish, you gaze into the mirror and know that you don't fit within the confines of war. Your golden, smooth skin contrasts sharply with the cold hardness of the armor, and you are reminded of the scars and calluses on Hector that you used to lick as he slowly stripped himself of his armor. Hector was a warrior; you are nothing but a soft prince.  You watch when Achilles strikes your brother down, watch your brother's glorious form fall under the wrath of a goddess's son, and you can almost hear your brother telling you again that he hates you, that you are the reason he won't live to see the sun set this day.  When Achilles drives around the city with your brother's corpse tied to the chariot, you turn away from the dust beginning to cover Hector's handsome figure. The spectators on the walls weep, and though you yourself do not, you think that they have no reason to cry at a hero's death when only you ever loved him the way he deserved to be loved.  No one stops you when you leave for your rooms, too caught up in their own grief and despair at the seemingly inevitable doom of Troy to even notice you slipping away. You don't cry; you don't know how to because you have never before had an occasion to do so.  You only hope Hector forgives you  You stand upon the city walls, and you can discern Achilles by the godly armor he wears. You think of your dead brother's beautiful body burned at the pyre, think of how you will never again see the sunlight glinting off of your brother's armor as he fights, and you want nothing but revenge for the death of the only person you ever loved. You know Phoebus Apollo favored Hector, and you pray he may help you, too.  The thick dust before Troy rises as the day's battle begins, and you whisper to the glint of gold shining through the hazy cloud at irregular intervals, ""Dust you are, and to dust you shall return.""  because though you caused his death, you will also avenge him. He is the only person you ever loved, and   He is the only person you will ever love.  04.02.24";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

17701;"""The Amazon Queen is a good opponent, but you defeat her in the end the same way you have defeated everyone else.

They do nothing but weave all day, and they always berate you gently when you make some blunder that the princess Pyrrha should have stopped making in childhood. You can see the looks of confusion and pity in their eyes, and even though you want to, you cannot tell them that you are meant for something much greater than this. The monotonous, confined routine is more than enough to drive you insane.    You long to see Patroclus again. You do not know whether he is still with Chiron or if he is back in Pthia, and you do not really care. You would even stay here if he were here with you. You wouldn't mind going back to Chiron, either, where you ran wild, or your own home in Pthia, where you at least had some freedom, much more freedom than as Pyrrha.    When Deidamia comes to you, you do not refuse her. You are lonely and bored, and you don't see why you should say no. She is not particularly beautiful, but neither is she plain. When you fuck her, you imagine she's Patroclus, and that makes you hard every time, but you cannot maintain the illusion when she talks to you.    It is not enough.       Summer   The soldiers are restless, waiting for Iphigeneia to arrive. Some of the other kings can barely control their troops now, and riots have become commonplace. Fights, too, because there is no other way to let out all the pent-up frustration and aggression, not since the surrounding towns have been sacked.    Your troops know better, of course. You may be the youngest among the kings, but you know you are stronger than all of them. All the men know it, too, and they often skirt a berth around you when you're walking through camp, careful not to offend you even accidentally.    That just makes it easier for you to laze in your tent with Patroclus. He is still as handsome as ever, sun-blessed hair and skin and sport-honed warrior's body, and it's yours, all yours.    You want to fight and win glory for yourself, but you want Patroclus more, especially when he lies before you, golden and bare and that look in his eyes, that smile-smirk on his mouth.    You won't mind if Iphigeneia doesn't come for another month.       Autumn   The Trojans have been expecting your fleet. They are ready for your attack, and it goes badly at first when Achaeans are being slaughtered even before they set foot on land. But they clearly did not expect such a big force because they run out of arrows before all the ships have arrived, and with you and your men at the front, they are forced back into their city.    Patroclus turns to you, blood on his cheek, and you want him very badly that instant. In your tent, you lick the blood from his cheek, and the gesture is both intimate and lustful. You think of licking blood off his body after a long day's battle, and you become unbelievably hard.    Only he can do this to you.       Winter   The Trojan winter is like winter back home, and the fighting continues underneath a less harsh sun. It snows one night, but you know that the war will go on the next morning, like nothing it has happened.    The dirty sandals of everyone leave black imprints upon bright white, and as you go through the day, the snow is dyed splashes of crimson as well. It is an interesting sight, and at the end of the day, you think of the few times it has snowed while you were with Chiron. It was impossible to teach you and Patroclus those days, and Chiron could only let the two of you run wild.    You have heard of lands in the north where it snows all winter long, and you think you would like to see that for yourself some day. You would like to watch the snow fall upon an already endless white, and you want to fuck Patroclus then, too, white on gold on gold on white.    You will not have Patroclus upon soiled snow.       Year 2   Spring   You can already tell that this will be a long war. The Achaeans have made little progress against Troy, and the army is never at full power because there always has to be some men spared for provision hunting. The Trojans can just stay in their city and merely repel your side's attacks, but that is not the point. You want to conquer Troy, and they want to drive you out.    It is fine with you. The longer the war lasts, the more chances you have for everlasting glory before you die, as your mother told you you will. And the longer you can be with Patroclus.       Summer   The Trojan summer is dry and hot, and it is only tempered by the sea breeze. You sweat just by standing under the sun, and if you were a lesser man, you would have lost control of your weapons from the sweat coating every bit of your skin and perhaps even lost your mind from the unbearable heat you must endure in full armor.    But you are Achilles, and this is your specialty. And when the fighting is over, you have Patroclus, who removes your armor. His hands are not cool, but that does not matter. Having those hands upon your skin afterwards is worth fighting underneath the merciless sun every day.       Autumn   There are fires everywhere. Soldiers are running around you, looting and killing and raping at will, and panicked citizens are trying to avoid them and run to safety, if that even exists. You revel in this chaos, this destruction, this plunder. Patroclus is beside you, mouth drawn into a thin line, and you know he does not approve of the men killing and raping innocents, but he knows the realities of war, and he knows this cannot be prevented.    You pin him against a wooden post, and you kiss him hard. He does not resist, and he does not protest when you reach beneath his skirt, either. It is fast and rough, and both of you are watching for danger during it, but you think it is beautiful the way the two of you can join so perfectly while a city is being destroyed around you.       Winter   The Trojan women gather on the walltop everyday and watch the fighting. At night, you hear soldiers talk about how they wouldn't mind fucking some of them, leers on their faces. Patroclus has remarked to you that even Andromache watches, but you know Helen does not, and you are not surprised.    You find their wails annoying at worst and oddly amusing at best, and you want to fuck Patroclus in front of them, on the battlefield, in the midst of this death and blood and merciless destruction. You want to do it anyway, want to defy the very nature of war.    If you ask Patroclus, you know he will not say no.       Year 3   Spring   The blood of the dead seeps everywhere, and you notice that it has even spattered onto the newly green plants. Some days, it seems to drown them, and you know that plants cannot live on blood. You wonder if they can learn to, though, the same way many of the men have stopped reacting to the blood and gore and death.    You are a good botanist, but you are a better warrior. It does not matter what the plants do because the bloodshed will continue, and no one except you and Patroclus, really, will notice if they die. But then, no one else has spent three days straight searching for a plant to cure each other, not knowing it was a test. The two of you would have done it anyway, even if you had known.       Summer   Many gulls fly around now, mostly after the day's fight is over, pecking at the carcasses. The battlefield becomes complete gray and white, and the soldiers curse about having to shoo the gulls away. They swoop around camp, following the scent of blood and shrieking; there's always a few flying around you, and you find them annoying.    Patroclus laughs at you, and he whispers into your ear, the blood on you is mine. The way he says it sends shivers through you, and you don't want it any other way. The next day, you snap off the neck of a particularly annoying gull, and when you enter your lodge, hands bloody, Patroclus merely raises an eyebrow at you, then raises your hands to his face and licks them clean, looking at you the whole time. It is so erotic, what he does, and you know no one else can make you feel this way.       Autumn   Some of the soldiers have taken up agriculture, and they have sectioned off a bit of land at the edge of camp, which they tend after the day's battle. Some of the others laugh at them, but you do not think it completely stupid, although you would not do something like that yourself. But then, you were not born a farmer.    You would rather sack cities, but the goal is still the same: to get provisions. Their way is steady and sure, but you prefer danger and the thrill of conquering. You prefer watching a city burn before your eyes while you and Patroclus fuck, two contrasting kinds of beauty linked together for a moment, one wilting and one blooming, both breathtaking in the very way they are. But you know you and Patroclus burn brighter than the city.       Winter   You move through every day like you were born for it. You probably were, being a goddess's son. Fighting is in your blood, and it is always a rush killing your opponents, a simple stab of your spear or maybe a deep slash of your dagger. You are naturally elegant at it, and you feel as if all of this is part of your very being. Maybe it is.    You do not care about the identities of those you kill. You only care about the way it feels as you move along the battlefield, an endless thrill and high and breathlessness as you dodge and stab and slash and block and kill. It arouses you, and you know that you have Patroclus at the end of the day. You are bonded to him through the blood the two of you share, but even if you weren't, you would have chosen him anyway because you know he would still feel like he's part of you.       Year 4   Spring   You play the lyre, sometimes, at night. You know you are good at it, and it is relaxing, letting the simple and clear sounds wash over you, letting your fingers move themselves in a long memorized pattern.    You can still remember learning how to play from Chiron, and although the music did not feel as natural as fighting did, it still came to you easily. When you could play well, you played to Patroclus first, under the moon, and you told him it would always be for him.    It still is. When you play now, he always listens, draped across furs and hides, hooded eyes looking at you, and you know that when you finish, he will be hard and waiting for you, and the sex after is always some of the sweetest you have with him.       Summer   Patroclus is handsome in everything he does. You have watched him take off his armor outside, watched a bright and a fading sun caress his golden skin, watched his muscles stretch as he moves his arms, watched him in battle as he killed the Trojans charging at him, watched blood splatter on that beautiful skin, and you know you are the only one who has all of this. You would not have it any other way.    His body has not been foreign to you for a long time, but you still like to explore it as if it's the first time, back when those lines and edges and scars were still new to you. No matter how well you know him, everything about Patroclus is always like new to you, like you are discovering it again for the first time. That's just the way it is.       Autumn   Patroclus grows a goatee these days, when he does not have time to shave. You tease him about it, but it reminds you that he is no longer a child at all and you are a man in all ways except that one. You do not dislike it, though, not even when it scratches you. It is a delicious sort of pain, and you always wave his sheepish apology away. The goatee is just different, nothing more, nothing less.    The two of you are no longer boys now, but nothing else has changed. Both of you are taller, leaner, and older, with more scars and experience and knowledge, but when he and you are alone, your bodies still fit together in the same way, and you know that will never change, nor will the way the two of you feel toward each other.       Winter   You know one of the main reasons, possibly the biggest, even, that your side still has not breached Troy's walls is due to the dispersion of the army. There are always soldiers away, sacking cities for more supplies, and you know Hector knows it, too, and wants to use it to his advantage.    But there's always you and Odysseus and Ajax and Diomedes and many other great warriors, and none of you need those men who are away to prevent a Trojan victory. You know everyone has his own motivation. Yours is right beside you, and you will never let anyone else have Patroclus.       Year 5   Spring   Both sides have lost many men. Less women gather on the walltops, and less men come out to fight all of you. But as long as there are still men left, the war will continue, unless Helen is returned. None of the kings except maybe soft-hearted old Priam care about the deaths. The issue has always been one of pride.    You don't care, either. It is not your job to clean up the dead, and most of your men are still alive, and that is good enough for you. As long as Patroclus does not die, and you know he will not, the fate of others does not really concern you.       Summer   The nights this summer are particularly humid, and you can hear the buzzing of the mosquitoes through the walls. They descend after the sun sets, and everywhere, you hear the sharp smack of skin against skin.    They prey on you, too, faster than you can kill them, and when you stare at the red on your skin, you think, no one but Patroclus can have that. But you and Patroclus are both botanists, so the two of you leave camp one night to find the plants that ward off mosquitoes. The camp is in a disarray when the two of you return two nights later. The other kings send Odysseus to chide you; you just hand him a few of the plants you took back with you. No one says anything after that, but they do not know that the two of you took an extra day, and you would not give up that delicious day of sex for anything.       Autumn   Patroclus gets wounded on the arm, something much more serious than one of those usual shallow scratches, and you are furious. How dare someone mar that beautiful, golden skin? Only you are allowed to do anything like that to him.    He says he can bandage himself, but you insist on doing it. It's not that he's not knowledgeable about medicine because both of you are, but you know he will just do a quick bandaging job and say everything is fine, and you do not want that.    You play the lyre for him that night, and you make him promise not to fight until his arm is completely healed. The next day, you are fiercer than ever. You will not have that man live. You will not let anyone who hurts Patroclus live.       Winter   The Trojan winters have always been rainy, but it is a terrible rain that refuses to stop this year. Even Helios has not appeared much, and no one is fighting. The kings grumble about the damn delay and how they're sitting here for nothing while the supplies keep dwindling, and you yearn for the curve of a spear in your hand, the blade of a sheathed dagger bumping against your thigh, the solid impact of a weapon against your shield.    Despite that, you cannot truly mind, not when you are dry in your lodge with Patroclus. While the rain pounds against the roof, the two of you fuck, languidly and gently and lingeringly, and it's like a million first times all over again.       Year 6   Spring   The soldiers have grown restless, and you hear whispers of desertion at night, when they think no one is listening. You cannot really blame them. It's almost been six years, and Troy still stands safe and whole. The general morale has been fairly low for a while.    You know, though, that none of the other kings will let them go. You will not, either. This is a war, and you know your side will win. Your Myrmidons will do whatever you tell them, and you know the other kings will convince their men to stay somehow.    Even if they all leave, you will still stay. You don't need them to earn your glory. As long as you have Patroclus beside you, you know the two of you can conquer Troy by yourselves.       Summer   It's a custom in summer for the men to disarm by the sea and jump straight in at the end of the day, and you are no different. The cool water washes all the sweat and blood and dirt and grime you've accumulated during the day away along with the bloodlust that takes over you and the high it gives you.    Patroclus always joins you. His movements are simple and efficient, but you always feel like he's stripping for you. His body is always beautiful in the fading sunlight, faint gold on dark bronze-gold, and you can never resist running your hands over his skin in the water. But you don't do anything more, not among this crowd of strange men.    One day, though, you want to fuck him here, fuck him until all you can feel is him and the sea water around you.       Autumn   Your men surprise you on your birthday with a celebration of sorts. They've built a roaring fire in front of your lodge, and there is singing and dancing and many slave girls. The Myrmidons tease you about finally being a man in every sense of the word since you've finally grown a full goatee that year when you don't shave, and you laugh with them, drunk and happy and glowing in the heat of the fire, Patroclus at your side.    The sex that night is honey sweet, a generous tangle of limbs and hearts, and Patroclus says I love you against your ear when he comes, but you know. You've always known. It's still a good birthday gift.       Winter   It is not the first time Menelaus has been asked what he will do with Helen when they win the war, and it will not be the last, either. His answer always varies, but the most often one is that he does not know, that he will do whatever's appropriate at that time.    You know that most of the other kings have their own ideas about what they would do to her. You are no exception. You waver between raping her, killing her, doing both, and giving her to Patroclus, but the first three options always sound the best. You have no sympathy for her, even though Aphrodite bewitched her, but if Patroclus asks for her, and he may because he already has once, you would give her to him. You would do so against your better judgment because it's what he wants.       Year 7   Spring   The night is quieter than usual. For once, you can play the lyre outside and hear its clear notes, too, so you step out of your lodge, and Patroclus follows you. You sit on the bench outside and play, your eyes closed and fingers moving over the strings automatically, and you feel Patroclus lean against you, head on your shoulder, finger playing with the curls in your hair. It is intimate, like it's just the two of you and no one else, and you think you have never been like this with him before, have never had a chance to be like this with him before. And you know that this is what you want to be able to give him, this small semblance of normalcy, but because of who you are, this is exactly the one thing you will never be able to give him.    You can only give him everything else, but you know he understands. He says it every time he touches you, feather light and lovingly careful, like you are someone precious, but you know that you are the one who's truly lucky, to have someone like him.       Summer   You can see the longing in Odysseus's eyes, the very desire in the tense lines of his body. It's been almost seven years, and you cannot blame him for missing his wife. You see the same signs in many of the men as well, and you know they miss their families, too.    You do not want to think about what you would be like if Patroclus were not here with you. You experienced that once already, and you do not want to again. Whatever Penelope is to Odysseus, Patroclus is to you at least a hundredfold, and you don't want to know what you would be without Patroclus to anchor you, how very different you would be now if Patroclus had not been there with you since almost the beginning.       Autumn   He offers you whatever you want for your birthday. His tone is light when he says that he has nothing left to give you that is not already yours, but his eyes are serious. And you think, I don't want anything else when I have you.   You let him take you that night, and when he says, but it's your birthday, you tell him, taking is a form of giving, too, and you know he understands. Everything you have is his and everything he has is yours, but in the end, he is still giving to you tonight. He is giving you everything you want.       Winter   The funeral fires burn bright every night, little dots of light in a vast darkness, and you think this is the way war is. There is only death and more death, and that does not change, even at the end. War does not create life because Ares does not know how.    There are many mounds at the edge of camp now, and although you are sure you will die before the war ends, you do not think you will be buried there. You don't mind death as long as you will have Patroclus until then, as long as he will preside over your funeral and take your urn back to Pthia, as long as your ashes can mingle with his the way your bodies join now.       Year 8   Spring   It is Patroclus's birthday, and you have nothing to give him, either, except for yourself. And some treasures you've looted off of today's dead opponents, but it's nothing special, and you already have plenty of it from the past seven years.    But you deck yourself in jewels and wear your armor, and it is exquisite watching him undress you, one article at a time, without any hurry, hands resting on every bit of newly bared skin, his very touch driving you wild. You know it is the same for him. It is a slow burn and breakdown that night as he fucks you, and you know this is what he wants it to always be like. You want it, too.       Summer   The talks of desertion have grown more frequent; you are not surprised when Agamemnon summons everyone and reminds them of the oath. You are one of the few kings not bound by it, but Patroclus is, and you would not leave him. Everyone knows this. It is the one bit of power Agamemnon has over you.    Patroclus says thank you as he leaves for battle, and he does not look at you. But it did not need to be said, and both of you know that. You play the lyre for him that night, and when he fucks you, you bite into his shoulder and say you are so stupid, I know, it'll always be this way. For him, you will make it.       Autumn   The Trojans receive reinforcements again. You think with the way this is going, both sides continuously receiving more troops every once in a while, the war will drag on for another eight years at the very least. But it is okay for you. They are just more men for you to kill and loot, just more people who may give you glory.    When you kill a young boy who looks the way Patroclus did years ago, you think, but you are not Patroclus, and you do not have an Achilles who would do anything to keep you alive. You have Patroclus wear the two wristlets you took from him that night when he fucks you, and you think, this is the sort of love that appears only once or twice in all history.      Winter   Your prize is a woman whose name is foreign to your tongue and thus, forgotten easily, but she is quite good-looking, long brown hair and long black eyelashes and smooth bronze skin, and you think she will work.    You give her to Patroclus, and you watch when he fucks her. They make a beautifully erotic sight, bronze on gold on bronze, her legs wrapped around his waist as he thrusts into her, and you can only stroke yourself, watching the muscles in his back shift underneath his firelight-touched skin, watching him kiss her roughly and leave blood on her lips. You think this is how the two of you must look when he fucks you, but you know the two of you are much more beautiful than this, gold on gold and so full of want and need and love in the movements of your bodies. It's because the two of you fit perfectly together, like you were never meant to be apart.       Year 9   Spring   Despite the reinforcements that still arrive at intervals, the battles are no longer so loud and chaotic. The amount of people fighting is much less than what it was when the war began, and the war has all but become just another daily routine, a methodical task ingrained into everyone's lives.    Because of this, Agamemnon tells everyone that the war is almost over, and you know that everyone desperately wants to believe it. But you know the war will not end as soon as Agamemnon says. You still haven't acquired everlasting glory.    It works, though, because the soldiers are less discontent at night, and sometimes, even you pretend that soon, you will go home with Patroclus. It is an exhilarating feeling, and you know that this is the only thing you will ever regret.       Summer   You can tell the days are long for everyone, and they wear on everyone's minds. Many have become sluggish because of this, weary from the constant fighting that has gone on for almost eight years, and those men are easily slain.    It is the same to you because fighting is part of your blood, and you know that others have successfully fought it, Odysseus and Ajax and Agamemnon and Menelaus and Diomedes and, of course, Patroclus. It is a rush on the battlefield, slaying and sparring and watching them fight beside you, especially Patroclus, and at night, when you and Patroclus stick together because of the humidity, you think that if fighting wasn't in your blood, this would be worth it.       Autumn   Everyone can tell that the end is near. It is a general feeling in the air, and because of it, everyone fights harder, trying to sooner reach the day when they can once again live peacefully with their families.    Patroclus asks you, one night, what you want to do after the war. Both of you know that you are fated to die before the war ends, but for one moment, the two of you pretend you do not know. You think you can sell all the plunder you've gotten if you want, and you'll probably end up ruling Pthia after your father dies, but you don't really care what happens as long as you are with him, and you tell him that.    Patroclus smiles a little, and it's tinged with sadness, and he says, that's what I want, too.      Winter   Andromache has not been on the walltop lately, and at night, the men sneer at how Hector has time to knock his wife up despite the war in front of his door. You have noticed a change in Hector as well, although it is not very obvious. He is both more and less fierce at the same time: he is more efficient and methodical at killing his enemies, but his attention is also less concentrated on the task at hand, like something big's happening elsewhere.    It reminds you of your own son, whom you have never seen and do not know or really care very much to know, either, born to you of a woman whom you bedded because you had nothing better to do. You know Patroclus would scold you for thinking this, would make you go see your son, but then, he does not know the way you have only wanted him for most of you life, the way you have only seen him for not much shorter. And that's okay, because your love for each other has already taken over both of you.       Year 10   Spring   The men give you Briseis as your prize. She is pretty, and you can tell that she has never had to labor before, but you know she will serve you easily enough. You taunt her about what you'll do to her as you walk back to your lodge, grip tight around her arm, and you find amusement in the redness in her cheeks and the furious way she stares at you.    Patroclus is waiting for you. You release her and tell her to clean herself, and she leaves after glaring at you. Patroclus laughs when she is gone and asks you what you've done to her, and you laugh, too, tell him that you've just overexaggerated what you wanted from her. He shakes his head, a smile on his lips, and then, you're kissing him, and when you pull back, you say, it's always been you, and he says I know into your lips.    Briseis is staring at the two of you when you stop. You just kiss Patroclus again.       Summer   Patroclus is unhappy with you. You do not like it, but you cannot do this for him. You would do anything else, but not this. You will not leave, though you want to, a little, because you still want your glory. And because he cannot leave, and you will not leave him. But that is not enough for him.    You fuck Briseis more often these days, but you still go to Patroclus every night. He ignores you sometimes, and that is when you leave and seek Briseis. But despite all of this, he usually doesn't, and although his mouth is angry and his hands are hard and it's mostly give, you welcome it. It has been ten years since the war started, and both of you are much older, but he is still so golden and handsome above you, and you think you can take it as long as he still wants you. Because he wouldn't fuck you if he didn't still love you.       Autumn   He chides you for not burying his body, but you cannot help it. You cannot bear to let him go, to watch the flames engulf and consume him, to never touch that lovely face and beautiful skin again. But you still cannot refuse him, so you tell him yes.    Even as a ghost, you want him and love him, and you ask him to come closer so you can hold him one moment more. But he disappears before you can reach him, and you are left alone again. You have gotten your everlasting glory at a terrible price, and you do not care about dying here any longer. You will not let it claim you easily, but you will not fight it, either, not when Patroclus is waiting for you on the other side.       Winter   The Amazon Queen is a good opponent, but you defeat her in the end the same way you have defeated everyone else. Even in death, she looks beautiful, and it reminds you of Patroclus lying before you, hint of blood still on his golden skin reminding you of how he must have died. You can still imagine it clearly: a few spears thrust into that beautiful body, precious blood staining his skin, and the dust and sand starting to stick as everyone fought over him.    You fuck her when she is dead. It is what you wanted to do to Patroclus when he lay stiff and unseeing before you, blood and dust carefully washed from his beautiful body, and you could have pretended that he was merely sleeping if you ignored the wound in his side. But you did not do that to him. You wanted to, but you did not. You would not have, would never have, because Patroclus is everything.    05.12.21";;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;1;0;0;0;semantic;0;1;0;0;rule

That she wasn't twenty-one, for starters. She was thirty-two when she died and looked every day of it. History has proved that to be a bad age for great and careless people (Gilles Villeneuve and Swami Vivekananda, for example. Karen Carpenter.) Astrologically, Pluto comes around to visit you when you're thirty-two, after the exuberant carelessness of Zeus and Hermes have showered you in their bright, unseeing light. When Pluto comes, the blindness recedes from your eyes as his cool, leaden shadow falls over you, and he will make you answer for every excess of your youth. Everyone knows that this was the revenge of the stars on Alexander the Great, who died of a mysterious fever at the age of thirty-two, but at this time the Aegeans were not yet a superstitious lot, because their lives were not yet governed by the cold and impersonal light of distant planets, just very powerful gods, against whose randomness no salt over your shoulder and no straw men could guard you.  But he was twenty-one, still the darling of benevolent divinities. He remained so until the end. Perhaps they knew that they had already taken everything he could give. It is not often that human beings have a choice as stark as that which was offered to Achilles, son of Peleus, which is one way of looking at it. He had been at war for about five years by then - five years in Troy proper, that is, because the other way of looking at it was that Achilles had always been at this war, that he learned to walk and run and fight and be, because he was always, always, always meant to be this soldier on this plain, his glory as inevitable as death, as inevitable as the sky in his rainy-grey eyes.  He walked into a bar. They all did that on their furloughs. He was still a general; the Myrmidons were going to raze this town to the ground later sometime, but he had time for a drink before it happened. There were townsfolks lingering on the shore, holding hands, singing, looking dreamily at the horizon. There was nothing to disturb the view, no ominous looming figures of black ships. This little Pleasantville would be a minor operation, mainly scheduled for keeping his soldiers' hand in as and when strategy ordered them off the plain.  No one seemed to know who he was. He sat at the bar and asked for wine. Over in the corner an old woman was telling a gathering the story of Tantalus and how he cut up and served his own son Pelops as food for the gods. He watched the storyteller wave her hands, painting pictures of the horror, only half-listening. He knew this story of course; he had seen it enacted before his very eyes when they set out to sail. Agamemnon had murdered his own daughter to ensure good winds for the journey. Iphigeneia had been young, intelligent and gorgeous, very enthusiastic about being married to Achilles himself. That hadn't worked out. She had fought frantically before they killed her. The funny thing was, Pelops had been her great-grandfather, Agamemnon and Menelaus' grandfather. It had never occurred to her that the gods might resurrect her the way they did Pelops. It had never occurred to her at all that history was repeating itself.  ""Nothing much's changed, has it?"" a voice sounded in his ear. He turned and there she was, dressed in combat fatigues and leather. She was tall, bronzed, with the sort of body that took years of fencing and running and good hard knocks to build up. She had long, olive-black hair and eyes darker than any child of Priam's. Achilles thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.  ""Still bloodthirsty buggers, the lot of them."" She sat down next to him and signalled for wine, too. ""It's the curse, isn't it. You can't end it. Their fathers and forefathers will all haunt them until they have their own mouthfuls.""  Achilles remembered the omen after her sacrifice. ""Like a snake,"" he said. ""Swallowing - ""  ""Its own eggs. Exactly,"" she finished, picking up the cup before her and draining it in a gulp. ""Who's the redhead, then?""  He stared at her, wondering what had happened to him. ""Hi, I'm talking to you, Sparky,"" she waved five long, callused fingers before his face and laughed.  ""Pyrrhus,"" he said, not taking his eyes off her face. ""I'm Pyrrhus. And you're lovely.""  ""Whatever gave you that idea?"" She looked pleased, tilting her head and looking him over appreciatively. ""Try Penny.""  ""Penny,"" he breathed. ""Penelope?""  ""Ugh, no,"" she laughed again. ""Penelope is a horrible name. So is Penny, but my only other option is Silly. Very silly. I discourage people from addressing me by name as a rule.""  Achilles made an effort to smile, even though his heart seemed in danger of beating its way right out of his mouth at any moment. ""Not even your lovers?""  ""Especially not my lovers,"" she said, raising an eyebrow.  ""So what should I call you, then?"" It was out before he knew it, as inevitable, really, as everything else about him. Her eyebrow shot up a little higher, an eagle's wing upon her brow, and she said, ""'Your majesty' will do.""     --  Three years later  They knew they were fighting each other even before the masks of war came off. It was in the movements, the curve of an arm as it swept around the other's body, the sweat-damp curls that escaped from a helmet, the surprise and the ferocity in the cries of passion. Things that no lover ever forgot about Achilles or Penthesilea. Time had drawn them close once more, almost as close as they had been that night in the town that was not so much as a memory even in the minds of its destroyers.  He found an opening and wounded her arm slightly before she pulled back and swung hard at his head. She was strong. She could crush and wound you and make you utterly forget who you were. She did not give you time or space. She would mean everything to you, consume you and give nothing back. He could not crumble to dust for her, though. He might have; it might have been easy and possible, but there were reasons that he did not, too many reasons, all of which came down to the single fact that he was not meant for her. Three years ago they had been drinking wine together and talking about the sons of Atreus. She had told him that they were cursed, and he had agreed, and wondered how the curse could be broken.  She had shrugged as if she did not care, and said, ""By someone brave enough to reverse destiny. To swallow the snake. To kill the father - or kill themselves.""  He looked her in the eye and advanced towards her. He remembered the wisdom in them. She beat him back, attacking him with new reserves of energy that welled up in her just as she seemedd about to give up. It would not be too difficult to be beaten by this woman. You could give yourself up with honour; she would destroy you so completely that nothing, not even shame, could be left. She could entwine and break the threads of fate, invert destiny and kill the killer.  He thought, and thought that a curse was not a bargain with the gods. The House of Atreus could reverse their fortunes, but he could never break his.  He did not hate her for being unable to change what always had been. He did not even hate for dying when she finally did, sword knocked out of her hand, his blade sliced clean through her heart. She had her destiny too, and he was it. She had not made a bargain, she had not been cursed. She was beautiful and brave and he had loved her for it, but he never thought that she might have deserved more.  She was lying sprawled, still on the ground. Someone pulled her helmet off gently - she had fought well - and the hair, still long and black, fanned out on the earth around her. Her eyes were open, the wisdom gone, the fear gone. He knelt beside her to close them and noticed the eagle-wing brows, furled now, bleached by daylight battles.  ""I hope you're clean, gorgeous,"" she had said on the stairs, leaning against the banister to look down at him. The eyebrows kept flying upwards, as though he were a perpetual incredulity. And he was.  Someone murmured his name. A crowd had gathered around them. Her blood pooled about them, lapping at his knees.  I'm not, he thought, kissing the forehead, smooth and fading without life. I carry my death with me, and now you have yours.  What can you say about a twenty-one year old boy who died? Pluto never had the chance to summon him. He was actually twenty-eight when it happened, the arrow flying into his heel almost an accident, if anything the stars have orchestrated for eternities can be an accident. What can you say about Achilles dying? Perhaps this: that he did not deserve more. That no one, not even a woman, not even a queen of the Amazons, ever got less.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

""I can't accept that,"" the young mother said. ""She ejected the diskette, write-protected it, and stuffed it in her coat pocket. She took her son out of the chamber and wrapped him in a warm blanket.  They beat a hasty retreat.  ---  The child in question was Meleager Calydon, the genetically-engineered son of Althea Calydon, and her husband OEneus Calydon, president of Calydon Enterprises, which you might remember took out Quest Enterprises in 2035.  Now OEneus Calydon was quite a shady character. Besides his legitimate businesses like computers, sporting equipment, and elevators, he also dealt in Colombian drug cartels and Japanese doujinshi rings. In his haste to acquire more wealth, he overlooked paying Diana Artemiso, the leader of the Colombian Mafia.  Forgetting to pay the Mafia is a big mistake.  Diana Artemiso, in her anger, sent a computer virus -- codename BOAR -- to destroy Calydon Enterprises's systems.  Now OEneus may not have been the brightest light on the holographic chandelier, but his son was state-of-the-art. Part of his intelligence came from knowing when he needed help. To kill this invader, he brought in Theseus Macintosh, Pirithous Dell, Jason Gateway, Peleus Compaq (later father of Achilles Compaq), Telamon Pentium (later father of Ajax Pentium), and the young Nestor E. Apple II, among others.  Another, very notable addition to this group was Atlanta Windows-Microsoft, the intelligent and beautiful daughter of Iasus Microsoft, another leader in the computer industry. She had all the latest equipment, and she knew how to use it. Meleager fell in love almost instantly.  The team began by setting up a firewall and deploying search-nanoprobes.  Everyone donned their Virtual-Reality visors and logged onto WorldNet. From there, they swiftly navigated their way to the source of the problem: Calydon Enterprises's main computer. The VR visors translated all of this into a marsh.  The BOAR virus detected these prodigies and lashed out, rending, maiming, and tearing the VR bodies and destroying the neural nets of one after another of Unnamed Redshirts. None of them were of noble parentage, so it wasn't any great loss.  Jason, unbeknownst to any of the other heroes, was trying to get to the drug deals of Artemiso, asked her help in aiming his Magneto-Spear. She allowed the MS to touch, but nothing more. She liked his desperate butt-kissing, though. Maybe she could find a use for him at Gateway Industries.  It was Atalanta of Microsoft blood, with inborn ingenuity and software stolen from around the world, with a virtual arrow charged with energy from the firewall, who made the first mark on the cyber-beast. It crackled with white-hot electricity and screamed--a harsh, unpleasant sound.  ""Atalanta has disabled it!"" Meleager cried joyfully, as much to get her attention as to congratulate her.  Anceus, a new employee at Calydon, with only an entry-level position, had joined this mission looking for advancement, and it didn't appear to be doing him any good. How was he supposed to impress the boss's son when this...female had just struck the first blow? Well, he'd show her.  ""Is that the best you can do? Chick? Let the best do the rest."" He charged the BOAR in t he same way Telemon had. This, and the anger of the femenist Artemiso, sent the self-absorbed little upstart to the Royal Order of Redshirts.  Theseus was able to adapt one of the search-nanoprobes into a grenade launcher, using contained magnets. This owuld have been effective, but something was deflecting the missiles. Things got worse when Jason decided to try his spear again and hit his improvised launcher, effectively shortint it out.  Meleager stepped to the forefront, and attacked from the side, hitting the BOAR's periphery with a blast of static electricity. He tried again, this time connecting and doing some real damage. He struck again and again, rushing and attacking.  Finally, a shout went up: ""We got it!"" and raucous nerdy laughter the likes of which hadn't been seen since Revenge of the Nerds sounded throughout the Calydon Mainframe.  Meleager gave the remains of the virus to Atalanta. It was only fair, since she had gotten ""first blood.""  ""Thank you,"" she said, and kissed him. Meleager was barely able to keep his mind in VR.  ---  Once they'd all logged out, Plexippus and Toxeus, two of Meleager's uncles who'd been in the hunting party, were jealous that Atalanta had gotten all the honor and fame out of all who had been there. They hacked into the system and stole the remains of the virus for themselves. They were the deserving ones, they rationalized.  Meleager didn't see it that way. They'd taken from a heroine, and what's more, they'd taken from the woman he loved. He drew his hand phaser and vaporized them on the spot.  ---  Althea was relieved that Meleager had been victorious, but when her tricorder read the phaser residue of her brothers, she fries a few circuits in the ol' brain and scraps her idea for a celebration of Meleager's victory, planning a memorial service for her brothers instead.  In the heat of her anger, she uses her high-profile access to break into the ward and boots up the computer in the ward where Meleager had been taken out of incubation. She took The Disk, the one that sealed her son's fate, and began to put it into the drive. She drew her hand back, unsure if what she was planning was right. This happened four times. It's only fair, she decided. Why should OEneus celebrate while I am in mourning? An eye for an eye, I say! Well, I brought you into this world, Mellie, and watch me take you out!  She finished the download.  The :::ding::: of completion seemed to be a deathly groan. It was the groan of her son, dying. He was courageous, and handled the pain regally. His only regret that he had died by a bloodless and dishonorable death, not having his brain electricity jerked across cyberspace as he fought for his life.  ---  Weeks later, Althea recovered from her grief and hysteria and realized what she had done. She took the coward's way out of guilt.  Meleager's systers were insonsolably sad and depressed, their grief never-ending and all-powerful over them...until Diana Artemiso invited them to be citizens of CyberNation, a WorldNet community, where they all became mindless drones.";;;1;0;0;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;fuzzy

He charged the BOAR in t he same way Telemon had. This, and the anger of the femenist Artemiso, sent the self-absorbed little upstart to the Royal Order of Redshirts.  Theseus was able to adapt one of the search-nanoprobes into a grenade launcher, using contained magnets. This owuld have been effective, but something was deflecting the missiles. Things got worse when Jason decided to try his spear again and hit his improvised launcher, effectively shortint it out.  Meleager stepped to the forefront, and attacked from the side, hitting the BOAR's periphery with a blast of static electricity. He tried again, this time connecting and doing some real damage. He struck again and again, rushing and attacking.  Finally, a shout went up: ""We got it!"" and raucous nerdy laughter the likes of which hadn't been seen since Revenge of the Nerds sounded throughout the Calydon Mainframe.  Meleager gave the remains of the virus to Atalanta. It was only fair, since she had gotten ""first blood.""  ""Thank you,"" she said, and kissed him. Meleager was barely able to keep his mind in VR.  ---  Once they'd all logged out, Plexippus and Toxeus, two of Meleager's uncles who'd been in the hunting party, were jealous that Atalanta had gotten all the honor and fame out of all who had been there. They hacked into the system and stole the remains of the virus for themselves. They were the deserving ones, they rationalized.  Meleager didn't see it that way. They'd taken from a heroine, and what's more, they'd taken from the woman he loved. He drew his hand phaser and vaporized them on the spot.  ---  Althea was relieved that Meleager had been victorious, but when her tricorder read the phaser residue of her brothers, she fries a few circuits in the ol' brain and scraps her idea for a celebration of Meleager's victory, planning a memorial service for her brothers instead.  In the heat of her anger, she uses her high-profile access to break into the ward and boots up the computer in the ward where Meleager had been taken out of incubation. She took The Disk, the one that sealed her son's fate, and began to put it into the drive. She drew her hand back, unsure if what she was planning was right. This happened four times. It's only fair, she decided. Why should OEneus celebrate while I am in mourning? An eye for an eye, I say! Well, I brought you into this world, Mellie, and watch me take you out!  She finished the download.  The :::ding::: of completion seemed to be a deathly groan. It was the groan of her son, dying. He was courageous, and handled the pain regally. His only regret that he had died by a bloodless and dishonorable death, not having his brain electricity jerked across cyberspace as he fought for his life.  ---  Weeks later, Althea recovered from her grief and hysteria and realized what she had done. She took the coward's way out of guilt.  Meleager's systers were insonsolably sad and depressed, their grief never-ending and all-powerful over them...until Diana Artemiso invited them to be citizens of CyberNation, a WorldNet community, where they all became mindless drones.";;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;1;0;0;0;semantic;0;1;1;0;semantic

Just for a flash, a second long scene. She stands over him, a sword in her hand. I taste the metallic tang of blood in my mouth, just for a moment. Since the sack of Troy I have drifted through days, a victim of a catastrophe too vast to stop. I tried to warn my people, but my words were not heeded, my visions not believed. All the death and violence came crashing over us in a flood that could not be halted. Since that night I have wandered like a ghost in the Greek camp, a shade in the body of a girl. My skin is cold and clammy to the touch. The men put their hands on me and I feel nothing, my mind drifting loose, like oil upon the surface of water.   And then Agamemnon, leader of the Greeks, claims me for his captive. As his hands come down on my shoulders I see this, this image of his doom. For the first time in many days I feel something leap inside of me. I see the conqueror of my city brought low by his own wife. I laugh aloud. He looks at me, incredulous, perhaps wondering if I am really as mad as they say, but my laughter does not stop him. I do not laugh again. Later, when he leaves to confer with the other Greek leaders, I turn the vision over in my mind. The fierce joy flares in me again, and I am glad to know Agamemnon will not go unpunished. She must be a singular woman, his queen. The first few days I longed to join my father in death, but this vision, this woman, causes hope to kindle within me. I will see him dead.   We sail across the Aegean, lashed by winds and terrible storms. When we pass by the coastline of his country, a beacon flares into life. His ships sail into the harbour, and he leaves his soldiers camped down in the city. The sun is sinking below the horizon, staining the sky crimson and gold. He takes me in his chariot, and we mount the hill to his palace. As we reach the top I see another beacon burning. Our arrival is expected.   We approach the palace. In the gathering dark I see her standing there. Clytaemnestra. She is a single figure, lit by two lines of torches. Her arms are bare, encircled by bands of gold. Her skin is golden too, thick muscles beneath its surface. Around her neck a torque of gold glistens. Gold stitching upon her dress outlines the powerful lines of her body. The torches burn bright in the darkness, and she blazes too. They outline a path up to the palace steps where she is standing. The light shines upon her jewellery, on her skin, and she seems to shimmer before us like one of my visions. As the chariot stops beside the path of torches she steps to the left and claps her hands. The palace doors are thrown open behind her. Servants come out, bearing a long red tapestry. They unroll it, throwing it down the steps. It unfurls dark as blood, a red tide flowing out between the lines of torches. I gasp. In my mind I see the steps of the palace in Troy flow with blood, real blood, liquid and sticky. It smelled of rot and the grave and the sea.   Clytaemnestra strides forward, beside the tapestry, not upon it. Her long tawny hair falls wild and loose down her back, like the mane of a lion. I have never seen a lion in the wild, but my father had one brought to the palace once. It prowled in its cage, movements constrained by the bars. She reminds me of its captive grace, and the sense I had that were the bars removed it would explode into violence. She comes to stand before us, at the foot of the pathway she has created. Agamemnon steps down from the chariot and she smiles, showing her teeth.   They speak, and at her urging he strides forward upon the tapestries, his feet treading upon the thick red path. In my memory, he and his men stalk forward as Troy burns, their sandals soaking up blood. He goes through the doors alone, and Clytaemnestra turns to me.   'Come princess, there is no need to remain in the chariot. Come into the palace, my women will see you bathed and dressed.' Her smile does not touch her eyes. I say nothing, thinking of the lion again, and her teeth. She raises her eyebrows. 'My husband is very taken with you, little bird. Perhaps he is in love. You do not have to speak to me, if you do not wish, but come inside.'   I find my voice. 'Why do you call me that?'   She laughs. 'You are so dark and still, you make me think of the nightingales in my gardens at dusk. And I have heard tales of your visions, your songs.'   I do not speak again, but allow her women to lead me from the chariot and into the palace. I do not trust her kind words. She spoke as sweetly to her husband, and I know the malice which must fester in her heart toward him.   There are low fires lit within the whole palace, so that the marble floors shine with light, and flickering shadows crowd in the corners. I am led to a bath chamber, a bronze tub brimming with water, rose petals floating on its surface. Steam clouds the air. The servants take my clothes and do not return them. I sink into the water and let out a sigh. It is soothing upon my skin, which seems to soften beneath its surface. I smell sweet now, like flower sap. I look up and find Clytaemnestra standing there, watching me. I cannot read her expression. Her brow furrows.   'How came you by that?' she asks, indicating a bruise the size of a palm upon my breast. I look down, and remember.   I speak without thinking. 'That, that is the love token your husband left upon me.' I am surprised by the venom in my voice. So, it seems, is she. Her lips part, as if she would speak, but a servant comes in.   'Milady, the King wishes her brought to him.'   Clytaemnestra nods. 'Of course.'   I am given a white dress to wear. It is cool upon my skin, still hot from the bath. We walk through the palace. Water clings to my hair, weighing it down. The girl takes me to a bedroom, and then leaves. He is standing there waiting, and smiles to see me. My pulse flutters beneath my breast. I thought I had forgotten how to feel, my emotions dying with my father at Troy, but being in this house has awoken them again. He walks toward me and I feel a sick dread. Maybe I am not the dead girl I thought. The naked want in his eyes is obscene. He props his sword against the bed and comes closer, close enough that I can see the individual hairs in his finely trimmed beard, like little spikes. Do not touch me, I think. I do not want your hands on me again. I do not, cannot, speak, but let him manoeuvre me, backing me toward the bed. His teeth shine in the torchlight as he smiles. My newly awoken fear has aroused him. I feel nausea swoop in my stomach and find myself longing for the numbness I had felt in my shock. He looks at me and sees my city burning. I am a trophy to him, a marker of his victory. I think again of Clytaemnestra. She will avenge my city and me, whether she knows it or not. It is as if this summons her. I look over his shoulder and see her behind, stalking forward on quiet feet, her sword raised. My eyes meet hers for a second. She raises an eyebrow. I look back at him, seeking to keep his attention fixed on me. She moves closer.   'Agamemnon,' she says, her voice low. 'This is for our daughter.' He turns at her voice, his hand going to his hip as he registers her words, but of course his sword is not there. Her blade plunges into his stomach and out, dark blood spurting forth, spattering her dress. Her smile is so wide it is a grimace, a snarl. He falls sideways onto the floor, crying out wordlessly in pain and surprise. His head hits the ground but he is still moving. One hand goes to his waist, coming up red. The other gropes behind him, reaching for his sword. I am faster. I snatch it up and unsheathe it, the scabbard clattering on the floor.   'This is for my people,' I say, and I stab down into his flesh, a hand span higher than the wound she has given him. It goes in deep. I am stronger than I thought. He coughs, red foam gathering on his lips. I leave the sword in him and step back, looking down. Impaled, helpless, he shudders and jerks, pinned by his own sword. He tries to speak, but only spits blood onto the floor. She kneels beside him, gripping his head with her hand.   'For Iphigenia,' she says, her lips near his, and she presses her sword down and across, slitting his throat. His lifeblood gushes forth, splashing into her smiling mouth, streaking her skin, dark flecks landing on her like red petals. She stands and looks at me.   'So,' she says. 'Why did you help me?' If I thought my heart beat fast before, it is nothing to now. It throbs in my temples, my throat, hummingbird fast. I meet her eyes. She is still smiling, fierce and wide. Awed, I incline my head toward her. Blood drips from her sword onto the floor, joining the spreading pool there. She stands like a statue, terrible and still. I look up at her again, unable to keep my eyes from her.   'You are not the only one he has hurt,' I say.   'I did not do this for you,' she says after a pause.   I laugh. 'No, and yet it is done nonetheless. We gave him a quicker death than he deserved.'   'Is that so, little nightingale?' she says. The blood, his blood, still glistens upon her lips in the torchlight. She steps around him, closer to me. 'You are even more vicious than I thought.'   'Maybe so. Will you kill me as well?' I ask, raising my chin. I know the answer, but I want to hear her say it, to make her admit it. I can almost taste the blood in my mouth.   'No,' she says quietly, very close to me now. 'You helped me,' she says. 'I will not forget.' I can see her chest rise and fall in her excitement, a vein throbbing in her throat. I cannot help myself; I reach out for her, and kiss her. The sword is still in her hand, but the other comes up, stroking my wet hair. I fall against her, clinging to her. She tastes of the death she has wrought, salt blood upon her lips. She drops the sword, but I do not hear it hit the floor, a roaring in my ears. We fall back upon the bed. Her weight presses me down, her touch upon my skin blotting out everything. I feel more than I have in days, a tide of sensation, my pulse beating like drums inside of me. I am giddy with triumph. I kiss the trail of blood from her neck, her throat, her cheek. It is like ambrosia upon my lips, the taste of victory and vengeance.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;1;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;rule

Even as she stared at her reflection in the pond outside her home, Medusa didn't see what her mother kept bragging about. She wasn't ugly, that could be plainly seen, but she wasn't the most stunning woman ever created. Her blond hair was softer than most and her skin was a soft peach color that was smooth to the touch. Many a man had asked for her hand, but she turned them down one by one, knowing that it was her beauty she was to be married for and nothing more.  Her mother would sometimes, in hushed tones, praise her by saying that she rivaled the beauty of the nymphs and even Aphrodite herself. In response, Medusa would blush, say nothing, but would then go to the temple of Aphrodite and pray that the goddess would restrain her wrath for the day. Every night, she would return and pray again, thanking the goddess for not striking down her mother. Many people had seen Medusa enter the temple alone and believed that she was praying the Aphrodite to enhance her beauty. They were nothing but rumors, but many of the common folk ended up believing them.  Today, though, Medusa was visiting another goddess; Athena, Goddess of Wisdom. Medusa's mother had bid her to take the offerings to the temple and thank the goddess for blessing them. The best of her father's crops were divided among sacrifices for Athena and Demeter and while her mother prayed to Demeter for the harvest, Medusa prayed to Athena.  Medusa bowed deeply to the idol of Athena, laying down her family's sacrifice for the month; the finest wheat her father had harvested, the first batch of milk the family goat had made, the first figs harvested. The gifts were simple, yet Medusa knew that they pleased the goddess. Making sure that the gifts were arranged perfectly at the foot of the statue, she called out to one of the priestesses to let her know that her family made a sacrifice.  ""May Athena's blessings come to you,"" the priestess replied.  Medusa bowed again and prostrated herself before the idol, praying for Athena's blessing on her family in the days ahead.  ""Why dost thou bow?"" a deep voice said from behind her, ""Thou art matched with the beauty of this goddess.""  Medusa got up from her position and turned to face the one who spoke.  The man standing behind her was attractive, to say the least. He was tall and broad shouldered, a small beard adorning his angular face. His deep blue eyes were looking her over as though she was something to be devoured.  ""I would not be so vain as to compare myself to the gods,"" she replied.  ""But what if I was a god?"" the man asked, stepping closer to her, ""What if I truly believed that thou hast a beauty to rival that of Athena herself?""  Medusa shuffled back. ""I would think that you were foolish and should not speak of such things in a goddess's temple.""  ""Then let me discuss it another way with thy beautiful form."" The man moved forward and pulled himself onto Medusa's body. Her eyes widened and she began to scream as the world faded around her, leaving just herself and the man.  Medusa's knew nothing but water. Deep blue filled her vision as waves lapped at her exposed flesh. She writhed as the waves rocked her and screamed again, not caring if the water surrounding her filled her lungs and drowned her. That would be a just punishment for what she was doing.  As suddenly as it happened, it was done. Medusa opened her eyes, the man nowhere in sight.  ""Thy punishment is decided,"" a loud voice echoed through the temple, ""Thy once beloved beauty is gone. All who look upon thee now shall be so disgusted that they shall turn to stone.""  Then, the voice was gone and Medusa found herself alone next to the idol, bruised and afraid.  ""Lady Medusa, are you alright?"" the soft voice of a priestess called out, ""The goddess has inflicted her wrath upon someone in the temple and I-""  Medusa raised her head and the priestess stopped speaking. The other woman's mouth opened into a large 'O' and she stepped backwards, her eyes wide in fear. Medusa scowled and a soft hissing noise filled her ears.  The priestess stopped her backwards retreat, her feet seemingly rooted to the ground. There was a soft clicking as the silk slippers she wore seemed to harden and turn a soft shade of grey. Then, her ankles began the strange transformation, then her calves and her thighs. Medusa saw the girl struggle, but she noticed how the priestess's eyes remained on her at all times. The priestess's whole body turned grey and Medusa watched as one of the priestess's veins pulsed slowly through its alabaster prison. She watched with her own horror as it slowed to a stop, the priestess now a sister to the idol standing next to her.  Medusa wanted to cry, wanted to scream, but she couldn't bring herself to. The power she had felt ending the priestess's life was...intoxicating. She absentmindedly licked her lips, a small part of her mind wondering if this was to be part of her punishment.  _____________________  The man looked no different from the others; same weapons, same arrogant nature about him, the same intent to kill her. Medusa had killed hundreds of men with a single glance; this newcomer was nothing but another nameless body to be added to the list of deceased. No one who met her gaze ever breathed again.  Medusa couldn't help the feral grin that graced her lips. That's why she had been placed on this cursed spit of rock with her 'sisters', the Gorgans. Her gaze had ended many a life on the mainland and, Posiden, the god whose actions had caused this curse to come upon her, had ferried her away to the Island of the Gorgans so that she would not harm another mortal.  Yet, every man that set foot on the island was added to her collection of statues. She had hundreds hoarded in her own little corner of the island. Every day, she would gaze at the statues, caressing their faces and kissing their frozen lips, wondering if this would be as close as she would ever get to truly kissing a man. Posiden's rape was still etched into her body as though her own had been made of stone that day, but she wanted a true love instead of a god's affection. Even the pleasure of turning men into stone was beginning to bore her.  The man that was approaching her now was still no different than all the others. He was young; too young to be out hunting dangerous things like her. His eyes were bright with youth, but Medusa could see age beginning to find its way into his strong face. Unlike the other men, she noted, he moved slowly, holding up a golden shield instead of a sword. He was moving the shield around him, scrutinizing it with determination.  ""You're a smart one,"" she said aloud, making the young man stop in his tracks, ""Using a mirror to figure out my location. I must say that I am impressed.""  The man closed his eyes as she finished speaking, raising the shield so that it was angled away from his body.  Medusa licked her lips. Yes, this was turning out to be very interesting.  ""What are you called, boy?"" she asked, moving closer to him. She relished the feeling of power as the man's body tensed.  ""Perseus,"" he replied. Medusa reached out and caressed his cheek, loving the feel of warm flesh against her fingers. She could feel Perseus's pulse increase as her finger lingered.  ""And why have you come?"" she whispered, ""It must have something to do with me. Everyone who steps foot on this island wants to kill me for one reason or another.""  Perseus bit his lip, almost debating whether or not he should reveal his quest to the thing that could end his life as soon as he let his guard down. He let his lip go, resolve urging him on. ""I have come for the head of the ugly Medusa to kill the man who is going to marry my mother.""  Medusa snatched her hand away. ""'Ugly?'"", she repeated, ""There is nothing ugly about me. Years ago, I was adored by many, most of them saying that my beauty rivaled the gods. Athena's curse couldn't have affect that much..."" Looking back on the years she spent before she was sentenced to life on the island, she had never thought of looking in a reflective surface. She stayed as far away from water as she could, ever afraid that Posiden would come for her again.  Perseus hesitated. ""You don't know?"" he asked, his eyes still screwed shut. His arm moved slowly, bringing the shield he held closer to her. Its surface glinted in the dim light and Medusa came face to face with her reflection.  Medusa stared at herself in horror as she gazed at her reflection. The form of her body hadn't changed much, but she noticed several changes to the contents of her once desired body. Her smooth skin was cracked and looked almost scaly in some places. Her now snake-like eyes widened as she stared at her face, old age and the spell taking its toll in the form of craggy wrinkles and sagging flesh. Medusa almost cried out in shock when she saw that her beautiful golden hair was now a pile of snakes attached to her scalp. They hissed in distress as she reached for them, wanting to tear them out of her and throw them in the dust. They coiled themselves gently around her wrists, their hisses turned soothing as they rubbed their ugly heads against her skin, trying to soothe her.  ""I never realized..."" she murmured, the horror gone from her face, but her serpent eyes still gazed at her reflection. ""I guess I am no longer beautiful now.""  And then she heard the sound of steel slicing through flesh and she saw the sky for a moment before everything went black.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;1;0;semantic

She hears what people will say about her. Opportunist. Whore who couldn't keep her word. Liar. Wicked. Ambitious. Bitch who doesn't know her place. Cunning. Cold. Proud. Selfish. Witch without a piece of a women in herself with a cursing touch. An amazon who wouldn't be broken under the severe pressure. Cassandra heard all of that when she made her decision.  There is some truth on all of the rumours - it was ambitious and maybe even a little bit selfish to ask for such a gift a man she already desired so much. But is it really so bad to want more from live? To want more than a handsome husband and twenty children? To want to see the world? To experience something? To be unique?  And besides she was convinced that Apollo will leave her someday. Sooner or later she will have to live without the godly tinsel. Was it so bad to want to keep at least a little piece of him? Would someone object if everything turned out differently?  But this was never a possibility in the future, so Cassandra could never be sure.  How a prophetic gift was filling her pieces of future started to fly through her head. Golden in the beginning how everything was illuminated by Apollo and happiness and their shared love. She saw them making love and it was just a glimpse, but she was overwhelmed anyway. And then she saw him, their perfect son, living image of Apollo aside from his dark curls which were all hers. And she loved him, she loved him so much, because to her he was already alive.  And then everything darkened because Paris came to them and her father was resolved that he could fight the destiny. He trusted her and Helenus that Paris means danger, but his heart was too soft, and he couldn't do what needed to be done and accepted him to the family instead. And this Cassandra was a mother and contemplated escaping while it was still possible, but in the end... she couldn't desert her family. Still hoping that something could be done. And the war is coming. And the war is here. And her son is growing so quickly, because these dark times aren't fit for children and heroes are growing up quickly when it is needed.  And he is just five, but he looks like fourteen years old. And she is pregnant again and all she sees is a darkness and death. Her brothers dying like flies and she knows that they don't return when they are marching to their last battles. There is nothing she could do, and she is going insane. And her little girl is born, all Apollo with his glowing golden curls except for nose which is all her own. And she is hardly baby at all, after a week she looks like a one year old, after a month she looks like three-year-old and after a year she is a fourteen years old maiden.  Her son who looks like an adult now is fighting for Troy and she is dying with fear even though she knows he have his father's protection. And her fear was justified because one piece of a future later, she is holding her dead son in her arms. He is just seven years old, even though he is taller than her. And she is blind with a grief and everybody is celebrating ending of a war, but she still knows this isn't it. She is trying to tell them, but they thought her insane with grief and she just don't have a strength to argue with them and she is pregnant again and she knows that her end is near and Apollo is gone, mourning on his own and she needs him so much right now.  And then the city is flooded by them and she knew this will happen and managed to escape to temple of Athena with her daughter. She known they would never desecrate temple of Athena, she was their goddess, their sponsor. She thought they are at least a little safe there, but then the future started shifting and Cassandra was terrified. They were trapped here. They were trapped here, and Achaeans were barbarians. Ajax the Lesser entered the temple and Cassandra tried to shield her daughter with her body. All their fight was for naught. He raped her daughter right there on Athena's altar, made her watch the whole act. And when her turn came, she was so numb with pain and grief she wasn't even fighting. She was looking into Athena's eyes instead asking her to make him pay for it. She lost her unborn child right there on the floor of the temple and the only thing that was holding her alive was her daughter. She lives and Cassandra must take care of her.  In that moment Cassandra was done. All she wanted was to stop these images and feelings which flooded her head and body, but she couldn't stop it. She couldn't stop it and she must see it to the grim end.  They aren't capable to punish Ajax, but Cassandra knows Athena will punish them all for that and it lessens the pain a little. They divide the women among themselves like livestock and she couldn't be even sicker anymore. Diomedes claims her daughter and Cassandra is horrified because she is glad it is him; he could keep her daughter alive; he is sensible, and she sees his safe sale home. She is horrified because she is glad for her daughter's slavery. King Agamemnon claims her, and she sees her own death then and everything skips forward.  She is staying in front of the Mycenae gates, her daughter is dead then, one of the casualties of travelling. And she sees her own death, waiting behind the gate, and all that will follow. And at this point she thought that the fate couldn't surprise her, but then she sees the world burning, the sun crushing to the ground, Apollo raging, monsters plundering and plague spreading. She sees Apollo blaming Zeus for everything but knowing he can't defeat the most powerful god of all. But destroying is so much easier that winning and Apollo doesn't care about anything right now. And she sees it, she sees the end of the world, she sees his death, she sees everybody's death. And that's the end of it.  Cassandra sees all of it when she makes her decision. And she isn't sure if anything can be prevented, but she knows she must change things and it hurts so much, because she knows what she is giving up. She loves him now; she loves their children. Maybe deserting Troy would be enough, but she knows she couldn't risk it and then there is only one option left. She hurts him. She hurts him so badly he would never forgive her. And he curses her in return and there is no turning back now.        Apollo watches her standing in front Mycenae gate. He watches her die. He thought it would be freeing, maybe even satisfactory. Instead he feels sad and hollow. There is still withered flower of his love deep in his heard. His anger cooled down at last and he doesn't understand her any better now. He still can't understand what happened then. The truth died with her and he is prepared to let it go, but before that he'll make sure that she will be avenged.";;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;0;0;0;1;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

She hears what people will say about her. Opportunist. Whore who couldn't keep her word. Liar. Wicked. Ambitious. Bitch who doesn't know her place. Cunning. Cold. Proud. Selfish. Witch without a piece of a women in herself with a cursing touch. An amazon who wouldn't be broken under the severe pressure. Cassandra heard all of that when she made her decision.  There is some truth on all of the rumours - it was ambitious and maybe even a little bit selfish to ask for such a gift a man she already desired so much. But is it really so bad to want more from live? To want more than a handsome husband and twenty children? To want to see the world? To experience something? To be unique?  And besides she was convinced that Apollo will leave her someday. Sooner or later she will have to live without the godly tinsel. Was it so bad to want to keep at least a little piece of him? Would someone object if everything turned out differently?  But this was never a possibility in the future, so Cassandra could never be sure.  How a prophetic gift was filling her pieces of future started to fly through her head. Golden in the beginning how everything was illuminated by Apollo and happiness and their shared love. She saw them making love and it was just a glimpse, but she was overwhelmed anyway. And then she saw him, their perfect son, living image of Apollo aside from his dark curls which were all hers. And she loved him, she loved him so much, because to her he was already alive.  And then everything darkened because Paris came to them and her father was resolved that he could fight the destiny. He trusted her and Helenus that Paris means danger, but his heart was too soft, and he couldn't do what needed to be done and accepted him to the family instead. And this Cassandra was a mother and contemplated escaping while it was still possible, but in the end... she couldn't desert her family. Still hoping that something could be done. And the war is coming. And the war is here. And her son is growing so quickly, because these dark times aren't fit for children and heroes are growing up quickly when it is needed.

One that threatened to sink everything and everyone on her tiny island.       Yet, she quieted and so did the storm. Her parents name her Philomela because her cries harmonized with the storm.         Sweet singer.        They named her with the hope she would live up to it, a soother of storms. Obedient.      _______________________________________________________________        As she grew so did her wonder and that her every curiosity was indulged. She was provided the best tutors, tutors who did more than teach her how to be a wife.        Philosophers, mathematicians, artists, all came through her father's court. Everything, she wanted to absorb everything. Know everything, go to all the fantastic places listed in her books. Be like the heroes of old.        It was silly of her, for one day her father would send her away to marry. Yet for now, she simply dreamed.        Dreamed of a better life. A more exciting one.        At age ten, she made a fatal mistake. Suggesting to her father that she should rule. He had all but laughed in her face       ""I have indulged you by giving you one of the finest educations a princess can obtain, yet."" His eyes glinted darkly, ""I see now I have made a grave mistake in letting you run wild. Now you spout nonsense about traveling and choosing whom you marry. You are a woman and it is time that you behaved as such. Learn your place, Philomela or by the Gods, you will regret it.""       That marked the end of her education, and on another level fractured her relationship with her father. He had always prided himself on being fair and ready to see reason especially when it came to her. She didn't recognize this strange man who called himself her father.       Obedient, of course she could be obedient and learn a woman's place. What did it matter? Learning a woman's place had earned her mother an early grave. Her poor mother had died with her younger brother all because to rule you needed a cock. Philomela did not have one but she had the next best thing, her wit.       So what if her father had driven away all her tutors, she was going to learn in other ways.        Was it so wrong to want more, more than just the promise of dying in childbirth for a husband that would replace you in a matter of months? She wanted to matter, she wanted to...be seen.    She is fourteen when she falls in love. It had been nothing like the poems or stories, it had crept up on her unaware.        Kallias served as one of her father's warriors, highly skilled with a sword. Just as his name suggested he was beautiful, but there was something about him that other men didn't seem to possess. He seemed more open to listening to her and her wild ideas, never judging just waiting patiently for her. Thoughts that women could be more than just wives and mothers that they could be more.       He sounded amused, yet she didn't feel as if he was mocking her, ""You mean like the Amazon women. For women to be known for their  battle strategies is this what you mean?.""       ""Well, ye-no. Actually-"" Those women were warriors, she had no training or skill. Kallias just grinned at her, his hazel eyes twinkling. She could feel he was holding back a laugh at her expense instead.       ""Princess if you wanted to learn the sword all you had to do was ask."" He said, tossing her a practice sword. It fumbled to the ground, but he tilted his head for her to pick it up. She hesitated for all but a moment.        So she did, those first few days were brutal, her hands stung from the popped blisters, but she felt empowered. They trained away from private eyes, yet she never felt unsafe in his presence.          It happened on a warm spring afternoon when neither of them had expected it.         A kiss.        ""A well-rounded education isn't complete without a mastery of weapons,"" he teased, adjusting her bow. Her sword work wasn't terrible, but a bow or dagger felt more at home in her hands. Kallias had told her to play to her strengths.       ""You say that as if I'm terrible at the sword."" Philomela couldn't help but rise to his taunt, ""then what does that say about your teaching."" Releasing the arrow, it whipped through the air finding rest in the target.        ""Hmm, I must not be that bad of a teacher if you can hit the target. Just imagine if you were on the battlefield, you would be down right deadly."" His breath ghosted at her ear, as he placed another arrow in her hand.        Already she felt her cheeks warming from his body heat, ""Aim again,"" he continued, obvious to her red face and thumping heart.       ""The first one was pure luck."" Instead of aiming for the target, tilted her head so that his lips were right near her cheek.        Then the bow dropped into the grass as she grasped his face, taking in his surprised expression.        Hazel eyes widened, flushed cheeks, she would say it was a rather good look on him, ""Princess?""       ""Yes?!"" she started to regret having been so bold. The thought had been for nothing their lips inched closer and closer together slowly as if giving her time to stop him.       She didn't.    They were playing a dangerous game, but neither of them realized just how much. She was to be wedded. When she did not know, knowing her father he was glad to be rid of her after his new queen gave him a son.        ""He praised your beauty, I think you will be married come this fall. What do you think, daughter?"" Her father asked, turning to her.        Philomela could have scoffed now he asked her opinion, smothering her displeasure plastered on a smile ""Wonderful, father. I think a wedding held in spring would be much more lovely. Please father, I had hoped for a wedding with the flowers blossoming.""       Menoetius, while thankfully near her age, unnerved her. The last time they met he did little but stare at her-no it was if he was undressing her with his very eyes. It was obvious he would not be a kind husband, hoping she would be obedient in bed and bear his squealing little heirs. If not- the thought brought a chill to her, her only choice was to escape. Time all she needed to do was bid her time.       He considered this, ""Yes you'll be fifteen then, I think another year would not hurt. Surely he can wait for my beautiful Philomela.""        Yes more time for her to wriggle out of this arrangement.        Bowing slightly, to her father, ""Thank you father."" He dismissed her. Bowing one last time, she let her hair hide her expression.        Truly, father.        They had named her sweet singer for nothing. For all that fell from her tongue would be honey glazed poison all she had to do was weave them and like songs they would fall on willing ears.    Words were more powerful than one realized. For the moment words are spoken, they are truths, lies, half-truths,half-lies, songs, poems, ties that bind.        Kallias had damned them both the moment he said, ""Marry me, Mela. Run away with me."" His hazel eyes shining as he cupped her cheek.        ""Be mine and I'll be yours.""       ""I-."" She wanted to tell him that it was foolish, that she couldn't but the words wouldn't come. Not when his love was so earnest.        Yet, the words tumbled so quickly from her lips,""Yes."" All she wanted was to be his and all he wanted was to be hers. If giving up everything for the unknown future was foolish then she didn't want to be rational. Kallias saw her, he saw her heart.       ""Really Mela, my Mela."" By the Gods and she had thought her tongue deadly, he was so open and free with his love.        ""Yes."" She sealed their vow with a kiss.        Promises were easy to make and break but so much harder to keep.     Under the cover of nightfall, she hurried down the steps, he was waiting for her at the entrance of the gate. In a few moments the guards would close the gates. She could only hope that she would make it in time. She would be free.       ""Philomela. Stop this instant."" Her blood ran cold, no it couldn't be. Just as when he had stopped her education, he was going to stop this too. No, no she wouldn't let him. They fought and he slapped her, but she pulled away.       She hurrying to get away from him when suddenly she was pulled back.     He had her by the hair, struggling against his grip she miscalculated the step and suddenly she was falling. Falling, falling, it almost felt like mercy when she finally touched the ground, and darkness took her.       When she awakened, found that awareness came in hazes, everything was hot. Tossing and turning gave her no relief from the heat that seemed to engulf her body. It was scorching, vaguely she felt the cool rags placed at her forehead however it wasn't long before until those too burned like flames.        She was dying, that much she knew was true. All she could pray for was that Hades would take her sooner rather than later.       Yet she didn't die, it had taken weeks to rise from her bed. Weeks of fever and torment. Weeks of laying in the dark wondering what happened to him.       Deep in her heart she already knew, if her father was willing to try to beat her to death then there was no hope for him. By the Gods how she longed to weep, but found that it hurt too much to simply do that.         Mela        One by one tears fell of their own accord.         Mela, I love you.         Run away with me.        It hurt, the agony of it. It was like pouring salt in her already torn and bloodied heart. He was dead but his voice was so clear in his mind. His face, his smile. He was gone. Just gone.    By fifteen, she is married.        Standing at the altar, she blankly stared at her veil. Today is not one of her most lucid days, nor would she have wanted it any other way.        The wedding is a quick and rushed affair, her husband is eager to unveil her. She could tell by the way his greedy hand wretched off her veil. He hadn't even had the decency to wait until the feast.       Philomena didn't even flinch as light flittered into her vision, taking in his disgust at her dull eyes.        She smiled.    At sixteen she becomes a mother.        The child unwillingly placed in her womb. All of her husband's talk of taking lovers had been empty. He stole to her bed when it pleased him and took his liberties as he wished. Even with her mind scrambled, she was lovely enough and men couldn't help but think with their cocks. To exercise what power they thought they possessed over those perceived as weaker than them.        So for months she struggled with pregnancy, wishing for it to end for. For hers and the child sakes, they couldn't be happy living with such a miserable man. Then slowly she began to love the little one in her belly, with them there she didn't feel so alone. Joy began to replace the horror of what had been done to her. All she wanted was to hold her baby, love him or her as much as she was able. She wanted to live if only for the child.        Unlike her own birth, he was quiet for a moment before wailing his displeasure at the coldness of the room. What she could glimpse of him in the midwife's arms he had taken most of her features. Inky curls and her dark skin. Stretching out her arms, she wanted to hold him just this once. If they took him now, she would never hold him again. Menoetius would make sure of it.        One of the midwives moved away and swaddled something, a moment later a pillow was placed in her arms. A pillow, heat built up behind her eyes, a pillow her mind repeated. She could only cradle it in sorrow, a replacement for the baby she would never hold.     Glory to the Father        Patroclus he is named, and then he was whisked away to be raised by nannies and tutors. Philomela wept for days after he was taken, what could she do. She had no way to advocate her sanity which on a day could widely shift, speaking was hard to do as her tongue would not move except to make noise. Vague grunts and moans nothing resembling words, it never ceased to frustrate her. So he grows up away from her.         She rarely ever gets to see him outside scheduled and supervised visits as he is the heir to his father's kingdom. He is the reason that her husband no longer bothers her for another child. Healthy and robust, if a bit thin, but she herself had always been slight. Patroclus favours her, all the court whispers. He does, but she finds he takes more after his grandmother than her completely, as his curls are darker and wilder and his cheeks are higher. However his eyes and freckles are all hers.        Apparently he favors her greatly in how well he does in his studies. He loves mathematics and literature, never before has she been so grateful for gossiping maids. Without them she would never know of her little boy.     At twenty-four.       Her son hates her, and she doesn't blame him for she loves him just the same. How could he ever know the truth, that she was all but trapped in her mind.        It is as if the Gods mock her for on days he does visit. She can do little but smile and blink. Patroclus her son views her with little veiled disgust, no doubt his father's poisoning at work. Yet, he is not cruel to her, for he seems to pity her. They were both at  Menoetius' mercy. Her son more so, her husband beat her son for any little thing, taking out his frustration at having a slow yet beautiful wife. What was the point if she was little more than an empty pretty made up doll. A healthy but in his eyes useless son who focused little on athletics and more time in books.       How she wishes she could have more lucid days, days where she could try to communicate with him, comfort him. So she tries humming to him lullabies her mother once sang to her, and slowly the disgust and pity leave his eyes. He often says little but comes closer to her to rest his head in her lap as she pets his hair. These moments were so precious to her, she wouldn't trade them for the world. Her child, her little Patroclus.       ___________________________________________    On one particular day her son comes to visit her, the Gods are smiling upon her. Her mind feels clear for once so she gestures as well as she can to the window overlooking the shore.       Her clever son understands and together hand and hand they march to the beach. There are servants milling in the background, but she focuses solely on her son.        How his eyes turned to liquid under the Sun's bright rays, she could only marvel at how tall he had gotten. Philomela knelt down for just a moment, there was a flurry of movement behind her to reach her but her son came over first.        ""Mother are you alright?"" She hummed letting him know she was okay. Finishing taking off her sandals let the sand fully sink around her toes, the tide was coming in.        Patroclus joined her and they took in the sunset over the sea, casting everything awash in reds, oranges, and purples.         They stood there for a while until stars began to dot up over the horizon. Her son bowed to her promising to visit her again. She smiled at him.        Of course my son.      Patroclus is eight, and Philomela is dying. There is nothing she can do about it, her time has come. After all her wishing, all she can do is feel regret, regret that she was leaving her son all alone to fend for himself against that heartless monster. Against the world.       Taking her final breath, she prays to any God above that her son would be happy. That is all she could ask for.    Dying isn't painful as people describe it, more like a relief. Nor is the Underworld as dark and gloomy as the stories make of it.        Here she is free. Free to be reunited with her mother and brother.        Free to....       ""  Mela.""     Philomela was meticulous in counting her time since she had come to the Underworld. Everytime a war was mentioned she worried that one day she would see her son among the newly arrived. Even if she was eager to see him again, all she wanted to know was that if he lived a good life, if he had fallen in love, gotten married, had grandchildren. Yet, nothing.       Wars came and went still nothing, yet one day she happened to ask a soldier about the most recent war. The Trojan War that had sent so many young souls to Hades.       ""Excuse me,"" she asked, touching the young man's shoulder. He appeared to be distressed, so many of them came crying or in pain, but he looked up at her dry eyes. So she pressed on, ""Have you heard of Patroclus? Son of Menoetius.""       His whole being seemed to light up, ""Yes, have you seen him? I'm searching for him too."" The young soldier trailed off quietly, ""He should be here....""       She shook her head, ""I only ask because I'm his mother. I have missed him for so long and now I'm finally able to speak to him.""       He appeared to be surprised by her admission, ""Yes, of course how could I have not seen it. You both look so much alike.""       ""Did you know my son well?"" Aha finally someone who knew of her little boy. However if it was true then her son could have very well died in battle.        ""Yes, my lady. I did he was..."" his cheerful demeanor appeared to dim. Before she could lose him she pleaded with him to tell her everything about him.       ""Then would you mind telling me of him. Please."" Even if it was just crumbs she wanted to know him, and then she would hear it all over again when she saw him again.       From the soldier she learned that Menoiteus had exiled him to Pthita for a supposed murder of another boy. Part of her was horrified that he would so cruelly cast out her child only a year after her death. Another part of her was relieved that he had escaped her ex-husband.       ""Was he happy there?"" she asked him.       His emerald eyes twinkled, ""I should hope so. He says the years spent there were his happiest.""       ""I'm glad.""       Then he told of the war, how her son used his skills taught by the great Chiron, trainer to demigods.        ""He saved lives, men who did not expect to see the next day, drawn back from the brink of death. He was admired by many.""       ""What of love? Was he loved?"" At this the soldier's eyes filled with tears.       ""He is loved, this I can promise you. I love him, he is my very soul."" Philomela did not press him for any more stories and the young man sobbed in her arms for what felt like days.        Achilles, she came to know. He had been ashamed to tell her his name for what he perceived as a betrayal to her son. Born a demigod, was her son's lover. She approved, her son had excellent taste. Handsome, polite, and adored the very ground her son walked on. All that a mother could want for her child.       ""I was selfish, I didn't realize what I had until it was too late. I would trade it all if I could see him again hold him again, my lady."" No doubt the Gods had a hand in had occurred most of the wars reeked of a child's chess game.       ""None of this my lady, call me Philomela. My son loves you and I too think of you as my family. Come meet the others, my son has not come yet, but I feel that he will come soon. So come Achilles, he would not want you to sit here and grieve.""       ""My lady, I'm not worthy of your-"" she stopped him grabbing him. What a funny sight they must have made, a waifish woman dragging a full-grown warrior back to where her family waited.       She turned back, giving him what Kallias called her ""you must obey me for you will never win smile."" She hoped Patroclus had at least inherited it.       ""Nonsense, he loves you enough to die for you then we will love you too. There is nothing one can do when he sets his mind to something, none can stop him. I once labored with him for days because he was a stubborn little thing. We will not condemn you nor will he. He loves you.""       ""I-,"" Hmm, he wasn't fully convinced. No matter, she had one last card to play.       ""You have told me your stories, would you like to hear mine?""       ""Stories of Patroclus."" His tone held a wistful longing.        ""He was a very chubby babe, and stubborn too. Did I tell you that I was in labor for days with him...""       Achilles fits nicely in with her family. Kallias took him under his wing, they both spent hours talking strategy and weapons. Her mother cooked for him and her little brother piled his arms with toys. She still went out speaking with the newly dead. Nothing yet.       But she knew more of her son and had his very heart.    Days, weeks, months, and years passed.        Achilles was anxious but she would not tell him just how long it had been.       A millennium or two give or take. She knew it only based on how the newly arrived would speak and dress. Why wasn't her son here? Achilles said they had been buried together but they had not arrived together. All of them had doubts but they dared not speak them around Achilles. The poor dear was already so guilty and grief-stricken. Patroclus had not been buried properly so perhaps that was the delay. Yet she wasn't going to give up hope.       Then one day Achilles startled them all when he suddenly ran off. He truly lived up to his name with those swift feet of his. Philomela followed him as quickly as she could.       At the river, Achilles embraced; a dark skin youth with curly hair. There is only one person whom he would embrace like so.       ""Patroclus,"" she called out, disturbing the couple. Achilles finally let her son's feet touch the ground against. My~my how passionate.       He turned to face her and tears fell. Here was her son all grown up, strikingly tall and slim, their same dark eyes. She now noticed the blood marrying his tunic at the abdomen. A gruesome death, however the signs would fade in time.       Reaching for his hands, noted the rough nature of them. Hands that had saved but also ended lives, her baby.       ""Mother."" His voice was so different compared to its once soft lilt, but he was her son. Finally she could hold her son and this time.       ""I'm sorry-""       ""Ssh, my love,"" drawing him so that he could hear her heartbeat, ""you didn't know you were too young and I couldn't tell you.""       ""I've missed you so much my son and,"" his eyes were damp when she drew back, ""I'm sure you have much to discuss with me. However it has come to my attention that you are keeping a very handsome man waiting. He has been waiting for a long time.""   Not as long as me but he is so grief-stricken just as fresh as the day her son died. His love never wavering, and besides who was she to stand in the way of soulmates.        ""Mother-."" Dare she say he sounded embarrassed.        ""Go on."" She chided all but shoving him into the demigod's arms.        The way they took each other's hands so gently, she startled when Kallias wrapped his arm around her.        ""He favors you,"" he whispered.        ""He does."" Thank the Gods for small mercies, even at his age she could still only see her mother and herself reflected in him.        ""No wonder Achilles is so mad for him. A face of such beauty and kindness few can resist."" She whacked him slightly in the ribs, he coughed a bit.       ""Be nice and if my son is handsome then that is no crime. He is my son so of course he inherited both my good looks and wit.""        ""And besides you're one to talk,"" she added just to make a point. The reunited couple kissed as if they would disappear once more.        ""They're soulmates, tell me you didn't feel it. The way he knew he was coming.""       ""I did, Mela.""       After all these years, she finally had everything. Her family was whole once more(Menoiteus and her father could rot in the very pits of Tartarus for all she cared) and they had welcomed a new addition. She had never wished for power or riches but this. A woman could never wish for more than dutifully keeping house and raising her children. A sentiment she had heard throughout her life. Sure she had a few missteps in her life, but she in her own way had broken the mold.        Happiness.    ";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

25972498;"""She was not surprised when he died at the end, in the midst of victory for the Greeks.""";narrator;third;Achilles;Achilles;;;;;unspecified;unspecified;;;;;war;death;;;;;"There were many stories about Achilles and Patroclus. Briseis knew none of them when she was captured.   All she knew was that this war had nothing to do with her, yet it had cost her her husband, her city and her freedom. When Achilles had come to her for the first time, she'd still been frozen inside, her arms still remembering the last time she'd held Mynes, her nostrils still full with the stench of the sacking of Lyrnessus. Her mind fled somewhere else as he took her, the sudden fall from the king's daughter-in-law to slave too much for her to understand.  When one of the older slaves in Achilles' tent had shown her her new duties the next day, she'd said in a kindly voice, meant to be comforting, ""At least he's young and handsome. And he's not violent in bed. You could have done worse, child.""  It hadn't felt like it at the time, but as time passed Briseis realised that she'd been right. The camp of the Greeks was filled with warriors far from their homes, from their wives, years of war making bloodlust second-nature to most of them. It didn't lessen the ache Briseis still felt whenever she remembered her former life, but she came to appreciate the strict discipline her new master enforced among his Myrmidons. No one except for him ever laid a hand on her, and when he did he behaved almost courteously. Closing her eyes, she could sometimes imagine he was her husband, back when Mynes had been the stranger she'd been given to in marriage. Hers had not been a love match.   It took longer for her to realise that Achilles' behaviour was not due to any particular gentleness in his character.  On the contrary, after the first real battle, not just a skirmish, Briseis shrank back at the sight of him. She'd heard of Achilles' unmatched might, yet she understood only now that fighting was his purpose, that he'd honed himself into a weapon everyone was right to fear. He certainly scared Briseis, and although she knew that it was her duty to look after her master, she hesitated to go to him, afraid of the uncontrolled violence that was still radiating from him.  As she lingered at the entrance to the tent, she realised Achilles wasn't alone. She'd seen Patroclus before of course, never far from his commander's side, the one person around whom Achilles' laugh seemed to come easily. This was especially apparent when they practised their sword play or wrestling, circling each other with wide grins on their faces. Achilles always won in the end, but even Briseis could see that their fighting resembled nothing more than a well-practised dance, their bodies recognising each other joyfully. She realised only now, gauging whether it was safe to enter, how far that recognition went.  Briseis knew about the love between men and youths, of course, yet because Achilles and Patroclus were both grown men it had never occurred to her that they might still play bed games, the way she'd been told was normal among many younger men. If it had, she would likely have assumed Achilles to be the erastes - after all, despite his boyish looks, he was higher in rank, stronger, the son of an immortal.   Instead the two men seemed just as perfectly matched in this as they were in their fight practice. They collided with each other with a force that sent shivers down Briseis' spine, violence turned into hard kisses and firm grasps. It was nothing that Briseis would want for herself, but between these two it seemed perfect.   Quietly, she moved back, leaving them to their love. Because that was what it was, she grew more and more certain as she watched them more closely from that day on. Achilles might be gentle with her, yet it was still rape, not love. What he shared with Patroclus, however, was like a force of nature, as if neither man was quite himself unless they were together.   Patroclus only spoke to her one time. He was as much a warrior as his liege, but without the dark current that seethed under Achilles' invulnerable skin. When he promised, ""He'll make you his bride once this is over,"" Briseis believed him and took it as the consolation it was meant to be. At least as the wife of Achilles she'd be inviolate, untouchable.  Already Achilles' reputation protected her during the days trapped in Agamemnon's tent, sparing her the Mycenean king's attentions, because despite all his posturing even he knew to be afraid of the Myrmidon hero's wrath. Briseis wasn't, not anymore, not as long as Patroclus was there, at Achilles' side, in his heart.   Therefore her blood ran cold when she heard he had fallen, and her eyes itched with unbidden tears. What would become of her, now that Achilles had lost his anchor, his other half? Would Achilles' violence spill over when he came to her, without Patroclus to reign him in?  She never found out.   Although supposedly all of this had been caused by a quarrel over her, when she was returned like a consolation price, Achilles had no taste for anything except grief and revenge. She was not surprised when he died at the end, in the midst of victory for the Greeks. Truthfully, he'd been half-dead already. Preparing her master for the afterlife, the tears she cried were for the kinder fate Patroclus' death had robbed her of as well as for Achilles, whose ashes would soon be mixed with those of his lover. Just like Briseis herself, he had turned out to be nothing but another victim of this war, although one that was unlikely to be forgotten.  Growing old, a slave in some Myrmidon's house, many asked Briseis about her time in the Trojan War. Briseis answered willingly, telling them of the famed Achilles, and of Patroclus, his companion. What was she but a footnote in their story, after all?";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

Corrie Worth, newly widowed, brushed crimson on her lips with a practiced hand, adjusted her hat over graying curls, and lowered the veil. Black gloves, bought at Woolworth's, weren't of the quality usually demanded by the wife of the third-richest mine owner in Harlan County; but sometimes keeping up appearances meant letting down standards.  She stepped into the waiting black Cadillac with the assurance of a woman who'd been driven all her life.  2  Her very first Cadillac had appeared when she was walking to school, barefoot to save her shoes, on a road more stones than dirt.  Looking back at herself with grown-up eyes, she saw an underfed girl who at sixteen looked no more than a city girl's twelve, still in braids, with her calico dress a little too short but no money to replace it. Her mother did miracles, farming the rocky soil and the steep mountainsides, but weather's a fickle friend.  The back door of the Cadillac opened, and Dixon Worth offered her a bag of peppermint candy to get in. She was too stupid with hunger to say no.  3  For Dixon Worth's funeral, the preacher took as his text 2 Corinthians 4:8-9. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.  The slip of a girl on the other side of the church wept with the concentration of a person who's biting the inside of her cheek and thinking about when her dog died.  Corrie would have lent her a veil if they could have admitted to knowing each other.  4  Sheriff J.H. Blair was one of the first to shake the preacher's hand after the service. Corrie suspected she could have danced naked on Dixon's coffin without shaking Blair from his certainty that he'd caught the right men when he jailed those striking miners as murderers.  What will they stoop to next? had become the center of dinner-party conversation among the mine-owning families. A new widow wasn't invited, of course, but word got back to her. This time, they attacked one of us on in the dark. Next, they'll be murdering us in our beds.  A more horrifying idea followed, one that had to be couched in a whisper. Next, they'll be raping our daughters.  Remembering how she'd wed Dixon--trembling and shamed, fearing that she'd made a baby, fearing that she'd incited him somehow--Corrie could almost laugh at fearing the miners.  A black veil hides a widow's unseemly swings of emotion.  5  The girl waited until Corrie had laid her rose on the coffin before she stepped forward with a straggling handful of daisies.  She had the fine features and sinuous movements of a naiad somehow stranded in these coal-rich hills, forced to guard a stream where the mines spewed waste. She might have meant to marry a coal-miner or go to Lexington for factory work or even chase the Hollywood men from the recording companies to get a contract singing songs older than the hills.  For less than a flicker of rain, Corrie's green eyes met the girl's clear blue gaze. The girl mouthed thank you.  6  Corrie had guessed when she found the pink lipstick on Dixon's silk handkerchief, but she hadn't cared until word got back through the servants that little Araminta Sizemore had tried slicing her wrists.  She'd sent a pair of cream-colored gloves--the good ones, from the shop in Lexington--with a message written small and folded into one finger.  7  Her own nightmares about miners involved hanged men, ropes still around their necks, accusing her. Once Dixon's safely in the ground, she'll turn to Sheriff J.H. Blair for comfort, and he'll mysteriously lose the keys to the jail, just long enough for the miners to escape. Their lives won't be worth much in Harlan County, but that's nothing new.  The thought of Blair sweating and grunting atop her nauseated Corrie, but it wasn't not right that any more people suffer for Dixon's sins.  8  Peppermint tea, so refreshing was the murmur among guests at the house after the funeral. Talking about Dixon's murder wasn't proper, not in front of his widow.  9  Raising the pick over her head had taken all Corrie's strength, but the wet, crushing noise when it entered Dixon's head had made the effort worth it.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;semantic

Now punish him!"" said Dionysus.   The Maenads, mad with rage at the violation of their sacred gathering, shook the tree, upon which that royal intruder sat, so hard that Pentheus fell out of it like an apple from the branch. He rolled downhill, the women were at his heels, then he jumped to his feet and ran like the hare, dashing wildly through the forest, breaking brambles and treading thorns. His white robes, which had disguised him as one of them, fluttered like a flag in the wind and not far behind him were the Maenads, running fast like jaguars, some on two feet and some on four, all in varying states of undress. They laughed feverishly and their animal howling and screeching echoed behind him, all throughout the forest; everywhere the Maenads came after him like hounds after the fox.  Out of the bramble and the thorns, Dionysus appeared in Pentheus' path. Sweet were his lips but dark his eyes, such as the gazes that lovers share in the night. ""Halt,"" he said and Pentheus stopped, held on the spot, unable to will his body any other way. ""There is that great stag, who is straying in our fields. That stag shall be my sacrifice,"" said Dionysus.   Hearing his call, the group of Maenads came rushing to him, approaching from all sides, encircling their rare catch. Trapped and desperate, Pentheus spun in a circle around, pleading with the women who approached him slowly now like the cat sneaking up on the mouse. ""Do you not see who I am? Underneath these robes woven with gold it is I, Pentheus, your son, your kin, your master, your king!"" He tore his headdress away, revealing himself, and some of them recognized him and some of them did not. His mother Agave saw a lion with firm loins, some saw a stag with heavy antlers, others saw a wild boar and others did see him as he was, but too great was their lust for him and their righteous anger to change their paths.   ""Spoil him,"" said the twice-born Semeilos. His voice was a terrible whisper in the trees.   Dionysus, who breaks the chains, bestowed upon those women that, which nature had not allotted to them. He gave them the strength of beasts and the power to mend their bodies into shapes fit for their lecherous purpose. At his behest, one took her thyrsus and touched it to her loins and such transformed them into those of a man. Another followed her example but the lean girl became like a hound and another one rough and heavy-set became like a bull.  The three transformed came running on all fours like the hungry wolves and behind them followed the rest of the Maenads, dancing and singing and screaming with joy. The first of the women jumped on Pentheus as he lay prostrate, pleading at the smiling god's feet. By his power, her fingers turned into talons and she ripped the fine dress off Pentheus' back, revealing the proud warrior's body to eyes red with hunger and rage. Terrifying Pentheus trembled fearfully. He pressed his lips hotly to Dionysus's feet, kissing them in all too late reverence, but no begging would move the avenger to mercy.   Wanton with rage like the bulls freed of their tethers, the half-woman pulled Pentheus back into their midst and onto all fours, into the embrace of beasts. From behind she mounted him and he cried out, for it was the first time he had been used such and she used him cruelly like men use their slaves, finding his virginal clench a thing most pleasant to break. And break he did, whimpering undignifiedly, when she had her fill and then came the next, the dog and the bull and the boar and the horse and the bear, all hermaphrodite creatures with the loins of male beasts and the sweet laughter of women bellowing from their heaving breasts.   Turning him over from one to the other like the drinking cup, they mounted cruelly, they kissed greedily, they scratched, they bit, they tore, and they spilled. Soon they drew blood from him, tearing like skewers into the lees of his belly. Blood was only incense to their frenzy and all greater became their brutality and the greater his cries. One, all human was she, bit his neck, blunt teeth crushing and grinding like millstones. Another took his arm and twisted it behind his back until it broke in three parts and hung slack and useless from the socket. Another drew her thyrsus, slick with honey, over his belly. Where it touched, the skin split in two like an overripe fruit, spilling dark red wine and clear clotted milk, drenching wet the ground below their feet. The last one grabbed him by the stones, pulled until they came off and swallowed them whole. Pentheus' eyes rolled in their sockets like those of the sweet heifer on the altar of sacrifice; twisting and turning, he screamed and screamed.  Dionysus stood unmoving. ""How you dance now, how you laugh,"" said he, ""are these not the reveries you sought to see? Oh, dear cousin, you shall enjoy my hospitality."" At once, the Maenads, bloodied, dirty, and panting with lust, withdrew in a circle around Pentheus, who lay in a trembling heap of tatters. Then as if pulled up by a string he rose from the pool of his blood, upright and the neck stretched like a crane. Moving his fingers left and right in uncharted gestures, Dionysus made him dance beautifully. Pentheus threw his limbs left and right and his broken bones cracked the tune. The rags of his dress that hung off his body followed each move and so did his innards when disturbed by the motions they came spilling from the cleft in his stomach like flower garlands swaying in the wind. The blood splashed up high from under his soles, like water from a puddle after the rain, and mad now with pain, he foamed from the mouth.  ""Look how he shakes and trembles. Listen to the moans of his ecstasy,"" said Dionysus and all that he said was true, because he willed it so that Pentheus' pain was also pleasure, two currents of water flowing from the same source. Pentheus danced, he laughed, and he cried and in that moment he saw up the river and in the currents of his own flesh, what no one had seen before him; Dionysus Mystes in his manifold forms, ever devouring and ever devoured, tearing and torn, the ceaseless hunger of the world, and he saw himself in the god's jaws, man and woman alike, moaning with pleasure as the teeth ground him to red and white gruel.  Thus at last by Dionysus' command and the Maenad's hands, he was torn limb from limb, split in two and three and four and ever smaller parts. The young women wreathed themselves crowns of his guts, entwining them with flowers upon their heads and the old ones drenched their greying hair in his blood as though it were the sweetest myrrh. They ate his innards still steaming hot and raw, they gnawed his flesh down to the bone and wolf cubs carried the bones away. Only his head remained in one piece; his mother Agave carried it as a trophy back to Thebes, where he was born. Meanwhile, the Maenads fell asleep in the embrace of the forest, nestling up to each other like kittens after a good meal.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic;0;1;1;0;semantic

The dual bladed dagger sank deep into them both.""";narrator;third;Cassandra;Cassandra;;;;;Cassandra;Calchas;;;;;self-sacrifice/stabbing;stabbing;;;;;"Cassandra, dressed as a messenger boy, found her way into the tent where the Greek Army was holding Iphigenia captive.  At first, her eyes adjusting to the dimness, she saw no one. Then what had looked like a heap of dirty laundry in the corner resolved itself into a woman, loosely covered by a stained linen cloth. The top half of her face was hidden by a mask, as if the soldiers didn't want to be reminded of who she really was.   A thick rope around Iphigenia's neck was linked to a sturdy post. It had just enough slack to allow her to sit or lie down. Her ankles and wrists were not restrained at the moment, but Cassandra could see the skin was raw there from bindings used recently. And she would be bound again, come nightfall, unless Cassandra intervened.  Cassandra didn't want to see what they'd been doing to her, but her inexorable, inescapable prophetic vision showed Iphigenia on a narrow table, on her knees, held in the chains. Her arms stretched behind her. The soldiers sating their lust on her, roughly, while others waited their turn.  They'd been doing it for days.  Ever since Agamemnon had decreed Iphigenia was to be sacrificed, and Calchas had delivered her to this tent -- ""to meditate and fast and prepare,"" he'd said in the King's hearing, knowing full well what would really happen.   The soldiers used her because they were angry.   Angry that they'd been forced to honor vows of allyship taken by their fathers, to leave their lands and families to take up arms over a domestic affair not their own. Angry that they'd been called to battle and then left to languish on the beach near the becalmed ships of war, because Agamemnon had to go and foolishly slay the goddess Artemis's deer. Angry because, when he'd finally decided to act, to seek the advice of the gods on how to atone for his error, he'd refused to do what Calchas -- who had the gift of prophecy from Apollo, and claimed to know Artemis's will -- had said was the necessary thing. He'd dawdled over bringing his daughter to Aulis.   They were even angry that this delicate woman was to be sacrificed to the gods, her throat cut and her heart torn out to be burned on the sacred altar. She should be gracing the household of a deserving man with her noble beauty. Bearing him strong sons. That she was captive amidst them, that they could take her with no consequence, was unnatural. It upset the proper order of things.   That they expressed all this anger by brutalizing Iphigenia night after night made no sense to Cassandra.  But little that men -- human or divine -- did to women made sense to her.  Starting with the question why Iphigenia was to pay the price of her father's error in the first place.   Cassandra had no way of communicating directly with the gods -- except for that one god she vowed she'd sooner die than speak to again. But if she had, she'd certainly have asked Artemis about her demand that Iphigenia's blood be spilled in compensation for the death of her stag at the hands of Agamemnon. Why harm the daughter to punish the father? Was she so insensible of the difference between one human and another? If she valued the lives of her deer so much, how came it that she didn't value the life of this young woman, who had done nothing to harm her? Or, why was she satisfied to receive her as a sacrifice after her body had been sullied in this way?   Even the goddesses were inscrutable to Cassandra. As one who'd received Apollo's gift -- curse -- of prophecy, she could sometimes see how they would act, but the whys were forever closed to her.  Iphigenia raised her head a fraction as Cassandra entered the tent. Perceiving the garb of a man, the princess shrank back, trying in vain to hide herself against the dim wall of the tent. Her mouth twisted into an expression, a combined fear and despair, that tore at the prophetess -- not only because it spoke of Iphigenia's pain, but also because it brought forth a vision of her own future, one that Cassandra hated more than any other.   She saw herself ravaged in the temple of Athena as her beloved Troy burned around her.   Clinging to the goddess's feet, begging for mercy, for intercession, as her clothing was torn from her. As the full weight of the armored warrior, Ajax, fell upon her, and he violated her body again and again, until she felt it slicken with blood, until she knew he had torn her fertility from her.   Her tormentor made sure she saw that vision often. She'd see him, standing by in his gleaming golden sandals, his hair streaming like the rays of the sun. But as warm as was the sun, his eyes were equally as cold. ""None of this would have happened if you'd accepted me,"" he would say. ""But you refused to slake the thirst of a god who was parched for you.""   She'd replied. Once. ""I was a human woman, Lord Apollo. I refused you nothing. How could I? Sooner say that an ant can force a tree to uproot itself and walk to another part of the forest. You wanted me, and you are a god. So, you had me. Every part of my body you wanted, you took and pleasured in, and I could not refuse you your pleasure. I could not even refuse you mine. And then you punished me, and I will live out my life never understanding why.""   Apollo's face darkened in anger, the way a thunderhead blots out the sun, and he turned his face away.   She'd never spoken to him again, although he returned to taunt her.  ""Lady Iphigenia,"" Cassandra said. ""I am not a man, nor sent from one. I am here to offer you succor.""  ""Stranger,"" rasped Iphigenia, ""I am parched.""  Cassandra approached slowly. She slipped her small, soft hand behind Iphigenia's head to hold it steady. She put aside the mask.   Even as bruised as she was, Iphigenia was one of the most beautiful women Cassandra had ever beheld. How she wished she had more time to get to know her.  She pressed the mouth of her drinking flask to the tormented woman's lips.   ""Do not drink too much at any one time,"" Cassandra reminded her. ""The men are training, and then they will be at their meal, and we have some time before they will come here.""  Cassandra took the dual-bladed dagger from where it was hidden in her clothing, and unwrapped it.  ""I am only removing the rope. I will not hurt you,"" she reassured the princess. She cut the rope from Iphigenia's neck, then set the dagger on the ground beside them.   In between the sips of water she offered Iphigenia, she laid out the story of her curse, and her vow of revenge against the god and those he favored.  ""But how will you revenge yourself against a god?"" Iphigenia said. ""It is impossible. We humans have no power against them.""  ""The only thing I can do,"" Cassandra said, ""is to end my life before worse happens to me. That way, I will at least thwart his desire to bring me a long lifetime of suffering. It is little enough. But the gods are not used to being opposed. It will gall him that I've put myself out of his reach forever, for his brother Hades is possessive of the shades he's collected and will not restore me to him.""  Cassandra gave Iphigenia the flask again, then took a sip herself.  ""That is where you come in. Princess Iphigenia, I offer to free you and take your place.""  Iphigenia turned her huge brown eyes on Cassandra, who wanted to weep for their beauty.  ""You must not! I do not deserve your life!""  Cassandra got on her knees in supplication. She embraced the princess's waist, pressing her face between the small breasts, careful not to bruise them further. ""I beg you, Iphigenia."" She touched her forehead to the woman's hands, kissed the raw wrists. ""If you grant me this, I have a request to make in return.""  ""What is it?"" asked the doomed princess.  ""I have hidden some gold -- I will tell you where -- that you might live without returning to your father's palace. I wish you to be free and to live as you choose. But should you come across other women who have been misused by gods, or men in the name of gods, and if the anger I feel speaks to you then, you have my blessing to harry them, in my name. Make them pay more than they want to pay for perpetrating such injustices. If any of my heart remains once my shade takes its place in Hades, know that I will cheer you on from that dark place.""  Her prophetic gift did not show her what would result from the request. Cassandra hoped against hope that this was because her choices would shift the flow of time, change the future into one unknown, unseen, even by the hated golden god.   But even as she hoped, she expected that Iphigenia would not believe. Would not believe any of it.  Iphigenia's voice was still barely louder than a whisper, but it was a little steadier than it had been. Cassandra fed her a few crumbs of wine-soaked bread, and the princess replied to what Cassandra had told her.  ""The golden god asked for your body, gave you the Farsight, took you, and then decreed no one would ever believe your prophecies? But why?""  ""I did not give him my love,"" Cassandra said. ""My awe, devotion, worship, body, pleasure, yes. Those were his for the taking. It was not enough.""  ""The gods are indeed cruel,"" Iphigenia said. ""Look how Artemis has treated me, I who offered her nothing but the deepest devotion my heart could engender. No wonder you vow to deny the golden god the pleasure of your suffering. No wonder you want this even more than life itself. I do not blame you.""  This was the part Cassandra could not see. It was strange for her now, being blind to the future, an impenetrable fog in front of her farseeing eye.   She turned to Iphigenia to offer her more bread and water, and saw the young, bruised and battered woman staring blankly at the ceiling, moving her lips slightly.  ""Artemis,"" she saw those lips say, although she heard nothing.   Then Iphigenia's eyes rolled back in her head, and she seemed insensible.  Cassandra feared she had died. But when she put her fingers on the woman's lips, her breath warmed them. So the prophetess sat by her side, watching for long moments the shadows lengthen outside the tent, moistening Iphigenia's lips with water.  Just as she was beginning to truly despair, Iphigenia stirred.  ""Artemis came to me, in a vision,"" she whispered.  ""What did she say?""   ""She did not decree my sacrifice,"" said Iphigenia. ""Calchas the prophet lied to my father the King. She seeks revenge against him. She asked me to speak to you, Cassandra. Her brother has claimed you, and she dare not directly oppose him in this. But she will help you -- us -- if she can.""  Cassandra let out an angry laugh. So even the goddesses could be rendered helpless by their male counterparts.  A bitter tear brimmed in Iphigenia's eye.   ""My heart aches for what you plan,"" she said. ""I do not like to think of your death. I do not want you to take my place.""  ""Think of it instead as a gift. You are letting me exercise a choice, the one choice I've ever had. The choice to say no to a god.""  ""Cassandra, I will make sure the golden god feels your wrath,"" Iphigenia said. ""Your sacrifice will not be in vain.""  They both knew that what Iphigenia promised was impossible. A human could not revenge herself against a god.  But sometimes the only thing to do was to try.  Cassandra, stripped of her clothing, picked up the dual-bladed dagger, took Iphigenia's place under the cloth, and the mask covered her eyes.  Iphigenia, wearing the garb of a messenger boy, kissed her lips, lingering over them.   ""Calchas is coming,"" she whispered. ""Sweet Cassandra, I will seek your shade in Hades when my time on Earth is at an end.""   Then she was gone.  Calchas entered the tent. The eyes that alit on his false princess were glittered with cold excitement.  ""Take heart, princess,"" he said in a cruelly satisfied voice that belied the kindly words. ""The ordeal ends tomorrow. Your great sacrifice will stir the winds, and the army of your father will sail forth to take Troy. You will remain forever in the memory of our people.""  He drew close, his face hovering over her hidden one.  ""Kiss me, and our goddess through me,"" he said. His hand groped between her legs.  Cassandra put her arm around his shoulder.   ""Kiss me, Calchas, and your death through me.""  With a mighty thrust, she yanked him down, breast to breast. Heart to heart. The dual bladed dagger sank deep into them both.  ""So die two of your prophets, golden god,"" were her last words.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;semantic

He sung, his love for me. His all consuming love for Eurydice.  My sisters with shaking hands and trepidation in their eyes wove flowers in my hair. Pretending not to noticing the deadened quake in my thighs. He had saw me dance, heard me sing. And with his lyre decided we would be. He sung his songs, plucked his instrument and all who heard believed that he and me were in love. I did not know this mortal man's name, I did not love him. But the gods loved him, his honeyed voice and strings he plucked.     I could not say no....      Believe me. I tried.     Orpheus is playing      My sisters dressed me in a gown, white like our funerals.  They sang the songs they told Orpheus was love, but were the rights of our dead. Crushed lips on my berries, I can feel his rough hands on my skin. Before our marriage, pinned me down. Shoved himself between me, red is staining the white of the gown.      His white dripping down my brown thighs.      Orpheus is preparing.      My sisters take my hands, the nymph I love brushes her fingers over my lips. Orpheus is ripping up her bushes.  And the last thing I have of her is the scent of her flowers when he presents me a bouquet.      Orpheus is threatening.      My sisters walk me to a river, and we dance. Locked hands and slow for my shaking thighs and bruised insides to keep tempo. One touches my face, her hand is cold as she minds me of her own love. It is said she was turned to stone and her head removed.     Orpheus is waiting.      With closed eyes, I trust their steps and follow suit in mine.      Orpheus is watching.      I felt his eyes on me, tracing my brown skin through the white gown. The curve of my hips, the swell of my breasts, the painting of blood and himself he left in my folds. His gaze is a blight upon me.      She had never forced me into her bed.      My friend, a viper, lies in wait. And when my foot, callused and rough lands near her; she strikes.      Orpheus is wailing.      Hermes takes my hand, apologizes as he takes me from him.  My sisters had hidden coins under my tongue, and quickly before he can stop the god-- I spit my fair into his hand.  The god looks surprised, but with golden sandals and a winged helmet he takes me to the underworld. He believes Orpheus's lies when he said I love him.       He spoke to me about Orpheus, his music is wonders and Apollo himself is jealous of his hands.      I in turn spoke to him about the scent of her bushes, the taste of her berries, the feeling of her laugh pressed into my hair.  The soft swirl of her around me as we danced, how raspy her voice was when we sang.      Her murder by his hands.     Hermes is silent.      Orpheus is singing.      The messenger god is kind when he hands the rower my fair, I am alone when he rows me across the River Styx. I dip my hand into the river, the rower screams at me. But the nymph is one I know, and she will not harm me.  Her face appears in the reflection of mine, we are both red-eyed and swollen.      The three headed dog escorts me to his queen and his king. I kneel before them both, and I ask for my love.      Orpheus is walking.       The Queen of Dead and Flowers knows that a mortal man should have never made his home in my thighs, and she knows the nymph I have loved and followed.       She is there, a flower blossoming in her presence.  She lifts my face, and I am able to taste her berries crushed on my lips.      She loves me.      Pleading, I dance, I sing, here my thighs do not ache. My insides are not bruised.      Before, I was even greater than Orpheus.       The Queen and King cry when I tell them of the paint of blood and white on my flowers folds.  Persephone wails when I sing of the murder of my love, Hades covers his mouth when he learns the viper did what I asked.      Orpheus is arriving.      As I dance, as I sing I beg them not to honor his demands. I sing as if I am sparring. Each verse is a blow to their immortal ears. His rough hands against me, his forcing himself upon me, his threatening to break my fingers and slit my throat if I dared to out play him.  The disgrace of having to be touched by him.      Persephone understands me. And Hades plans for me.        Orpheus is entering.      The Queen and the King listen to his plea, comparing his song to mine. I hold her hand tight.      The Queen and the King have to hold their shoulders back as he spews his lies. How I love him, the treachery of the snake, the flowers, stones and the trees crying for them.      They were not crying for him and me in mourning. They were crying for me and my love. Their tears had no purpose for him.      Orpheus is lying.      Hades says he will allow me to journey with him to the mortal world. Provided he does not look back to me.      Persephone will whisper in his ear, in the darkness doubt, of her husband.      Orpheus is celebrating.      I follow where he leads, his song singing of what he will do to me when we enter the sun. Demanding me to answer when the Queen's voice is too strong.      Persephone, when we are half to the mortal world tells me not to answer. I feel her hands on my waist, the swell of where my womb presses against my skin and the folds of fat on my belly. I feel her love and protection heal the injuries of my half living half shade form.  Restoring me to what I am.  Her acts of rage were ones she learned from me.      We had danced before she became the queen. Now I have the confirmation that she still remembers me.      Orpheus is doubting.     He steps to the sunlight, the Queen trailing behind and whispering one final deceit.  I stay behind, one final step before I would be trapped with him.      Orpheus is turning.      I see my sisters behind him, celebration as our queen gently, puts her hands on me and to her I follow where she leads.      Orpheus has failed.      Her lips I trace with my fingertips, her hands are soft upon me. Kisses where he laid his marks upon me, leaving her sweet flora scent where his male musk was forced upon me.      Our Queen and Our King ask us to sing. And with her raspy and my sweet voice.      Eurydice is singing.   ";;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;1;0;0;0;semantic;0;1;0;0;rule

But I failed, he has been dead for years, and I am a god.   ""You can't beat me, you know"" I said, smiling. He took it as a challenge and laughed. His laugh was melodic. Beautiful and positive. Like him. Happy, amazing, beautiful. He wore a white toga, draped over his tan skin. And hair as brown as wood, as pretty as nature.   We were in a sunny field playing, as we both loved sports. He grabbed a diskus. ""Watch me"", he said teasingly. He threw the diskus into the air. It landed far, but not far enough to beat a god. He smiled, baiting me to join the game. He smiled as radiant as the sun, pure as fresh water. I loved him.   His eyes twinkled as I took the diskus.   ""We'll see""   I laughed and grabbed the diskus. I threw it into the air, so fast it was almost scattering the clouds. He ran laughing to catch it. He should have gotten it, but in those last moments it felt like years.   My heart stopped. So did his. A slight change in the wind destroyed everything. Instead of catching the diskus,it hit his head. Blood trickled from his head. He fell like icarus, he fell like the setting sun, he fell like the rain, he fell like the tears from my eyes.He hit the ground, and I ran to catch him. I held him in my arms, watching the blood fall from his beautiful head. I held him, hugging him, as he left this world. It pains me to recall. I tried everything. Everything. Magic, all forms of healing. But I could not bring him back. Me, the god of healing, failed.   I cupped his cheeks and sobbed. I failed. I have failed.Words of consciousness fell from my lips, but none could capture my sadness. Behold the blood of Hyacinthus, which had poured out on the ground from his head and stained the grass, and it changed from blood;   and in its place a flower, more beautiful than royal phonecian, was born. Almost seemed like a lily, were it not that one was purple and the other white. But I was not satisfied with this. If he should leave, he would leave a trail of his happiness. I worked the magic of my sadness on flower leaves. These letters AI, AI, are inscribed on them.  The sounds of my crying when he fell shall be inscribed in the flower.   The sun sets and it darkens. I kissed him for the last.   Goodbye, Hyacinthus. I love you.  The sun rests.   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)   (tw: mentioned non con)not detailed))  There was a girl, and there was a god, and there was me. The god is Eros, the god of love. The girl was Daphne, a river nymph whose beauty could rival Aphrodite's herself. And I was the god of the sun, amongst many other things. One of those was Archery.   I saw Eros with his bow and arrows, preparing for his job. That day I was mad, as I had lost a match with my sister, Artemis. Eros was hiding behind a tree, watching a couple in the woods. ""Ah-ah-ah, what are you doing with those weapons, don't you think its too powerful for you?"" I said, smirking. Eros however, did not think that was funny. He scowled. ""That equipment of yours doesn't even fit you. Those weapons are for those who have power, as I have just slain the Python, whereas you will be content to provoke some loves by your arrow."" I look back on it and I realize that may have not been the best thing to do.   Eros may be the god of love, but with love comes heartbreak.  The insulted god glared at me through his eyes. He hadnt said anything, he just walked away.  I should have not thought he would let me go.   The god of love then prepared two arrows, as i have learnt. One of gold, was of lead. For the god of love, he was filled with hatred. He shot the golden arrow at me, and the lead to a river nymph, Daphne. Those arrows were magic, shot after each other, would become connected. Gold arrows bring out all the love you could ever have for a person to exist, lead arrows are the opposite. Lead arrows bring out all the hatred you have for a person to the surface. When those arrows are intertwined, so are you.  I met Daphne as i was walking in the woods. There was something within me, something embedded in my soul. A voice whispering in my head, driving me mad with desire to enter this woods. Maybe I was possessed. Somewhere in me drove me to the place deep in the woods, where I first saw her. The only time I have felt this love was with Hyacinthus. Maybe that was a clue that this would end in failure. My failure.  She was sitting on a rock, making a bow. Scrape scrape, went the blade, her delicate hands hold it as she carved. I could have watched her all day, for it not she have noticed me. She looked up and her eyes met mine. Whereas mine was filled with pure, pure, pure, lust, but hers filled with rage, and pure hatred. Her piercing eyes met mine, and I, the god of many things, a god whom has fought many monsters, but i have never seen such hatred as i saw in her eyes. Like a rake, seeing my future, my past, and my present. Combing my soul, seeing the dark parts. Seeing what I will do to her.  I regret what i have done, but at that time-- i would not be swayed. I followed her relentlessly, I chased her, not stopping. I wanted her, I intended to have her. But if i had truly loved her I would have let go. Is it love if I had loved her, i would have dedicated my life to her, but i caused her destruction. I should have let her go. But instead i chased her.  I left her no choice, and she sacrified her life to turn into a tree. She prayed to the god Peneus, and he took mercy, and now she is lost forever. Leaving me, just as Hyacinthus had. Both my fault. If only I didnt fight Zephyros, if only i didnt fight Eros, she might have loved me. I laid on the ground of the tree, weeping. I might died with such pain, different from the sinking numbness of Hyacinthus, the poison of his death seeping into my heart. But this was different, a different pain. It was like a sharp knife, my guilt melded into a knife, stabbing me many times with no mercy. A parallel to what i have done. No mercy.   Is this the guilt and sorrow that makes mortals die?  If i could, i would. But thats ridiculous. I could not die. I would live on, each passing moment with grief for my two loves. I pray to Daphne for her forgiveness.   I dared Zephyros, the West Wind, who also loved Hyacinthus. I dared him to take him away from me. My greed caused his death.  I taunted Eros, and my mockery of him is what drove Daphne to her death.  The stories say i chased her on whim, that she was just another pretty face. The stories are wrong. When she became a tree, i could feel part of my heart turn into bark as well.   She became a laurel tree, and i took her leaves and crafted a wreath--- the laurel wreath. Funny---the laurel wreath was made from failure, my failure, yet it is given to heroes for their victory. Each time some hero wins, it reminds me i failed.  I caused the death of them.  I knelt at the ground.  ""Forgive me""  The sun rests.  (hi so i realized since this is from apollo's pov, it may seem like its romanticizing this---- which, no. thats not what i mean to do. I do not think actions like this is okay. Do not do this. Respect people's boundaries. I tried to make it as not detailed as possible as i do not agree on anyone that these actions are okay. I do not mean to romanticize anything.)(this is different from Hyacinthus and Apollo, as Hyacinthus apparently loved him too.)(its just the daphne/apollo thats non/con (including apollo's other lovers.... Yeah its... just.. yeah.)DONT do r@pe)  In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book I: Apollo and Daphne, Ovid uses animals to make the emotions of characters more relatable to the reader. Ovid characterizes Apollo's pursuit for Daphne as more animalistic than human, and creates the metaphor of a predator and its prey to show the connection between the two. Ovid writes, ""sic agna lupum, sic cerva leonem, sic aquilam penna fugiunt trepidante columbae,"" meaning,   ""Thus a young lamb flees the wolf, thus the doe flees the lion, thus the dove flees the eagle, wing trembling.""   Each animal that is being preyed on is fleeing from its predator, and in each case the predator is as the stronger animal. The word ""fugere"" shows the urgency about and genuine fear of the predator. Ovid uses the word ""fugiunt"" in the present tense, showing that the prey is still fleeing its predator.(so theres clearly alot wrong with apollo and daphne, and i point out i dont want to romanticize it. I hope i explained this.)  Dont chase after people when they say no";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule

It oozed from the cracks, and she felt her anger return as she watched the blood trickle down her arm.  She thought of that man's audacity--of how he brought his club down upon her fragile body--and the contempt that sloshed within Ilona's body almost made her crawl back out of that casket. Almost made her return to the streets with her broken body, all to find the man that nearly destroyed her and tear out his throat. Her body might be damaged, but her teeth were still wondrously sharp. The man's flesh would yield easily to the diamond points.  Ilona didn't leave the safety of the casket though. The dollmaker could only mend so many cracks before she would have to replace parts of Ilona's body entirely, and new limbs took months to acclimate to. She would be even less equipped to take revenge upon the abhorrent man if her arms refused to move.  So she remained in her casket, her sanctuary. Ilona closed her eyes, and she imagined the glass orbs rattling about in her hollow skull.    No.   They were more likely floating in a sea of blood. The dollmaker said she was more ravenous than the previous dolls--her siblings. Ilona couldn't resist the call of the blood though. The dollmaker's own blood might have been too thin and bland to be palatable, but the city was filled with far more delectable people. Ilona particularly savored blood laced with dark wine, with bourbon and vodka and heavy beer.  That was, after all, why she'd initially targeted that man. He was a regular at Loretta's, and she could always smell the beer upon his breath.    Good beer.   How was she supposed to know the drunkard could defend himself?  She rested her hands upon her chest, the lovingly carved fingers growing numb as more blood flowed from her body. Her green dress was probably stained beyond repair.  Ilona vowed to make the man suffer for ruining her dress. Perhaps she'd gouge his equally green eyes from his gaunt face before she tore him to shreds. A quick death seemed too merciful.  Her fingers twitched once, twice, and then they stilled.  Second day, second prompt. There's some sexual content here, but nothing major, unless we're considering doppelganger sex to be incest. Then there's incest here, I guess.  The other Ash Holliday slept under the bed. Ash couldn't explain why a doppelganger of themself existed, nor could they answer why the creature was most comfortable on the cold floor, curled up beside Ash's collection of colorful sneakers. They could only shrug and accept the doppelganger's existence as a truth without explanation.  Ash opened their eyes as they felt the touch of cool, chubby hands upon their face. They weren't sleeping--not really. The doppelganger always left its nest at the stroke of midnight. The creature crawled onto the bed, and it straddled Ash's hips. It was a being defined by strict routines.  The doppelganger's lips were cold upon Ash's own. It might have been a reflection of Ash's own plain appearance, all unremarkable eyes and lank hair, but it lacked Ash's warmth. The doppelganger had no life pumping through its own veins.  It had to seek Ash for heat.  For life.  A low, content sigh left Ash as the doppelganger's hand slipped beneath the blankets and discovered the plump lips of their sex. ""Incorrigible,"" they murmured, but they still spread their legs to give the doppelganger better access to their pussy.  The doppelganger didn't answer them. It was incapable of speech--the loudest sounds it could muster being nothing more than breathy rasps. Anyone eavesdropping upon the lascivious scene in that bedroom would only ever hear Ash's low moans.  Ash wound their arms around the doppelganger, and the mattress groaned as the two became entangled.  Beneath them, under the mattress, laid the mess of Ash's shoes. A hand mirror, long forgotten by Ash, laid among the heap of bright canvas and dingy shoelaces, the polished surface as chilly as the doppelganger itself.  So, uh. In my defense, I had this written before the Roe v. Wade news last night. The forced pregnancy is coincidental. If that's an issue then give this story a pass.  Other warnings include the implication of past rape and body horror. And centipedes, if that bothers you.  This short piece is a continuation of a story I wrote for the Like It Or Not zine. Johnny just continuing to have a horrible life.  ""That's right, baby,"" Acid purred, hands holding Johnny's thighs spread and ratted hair tickling the back of his captive's neck. ""Just take those deep breaths.""   Johnny didn't respond to the creature. He instead bit back a pained sob as another contraction rolled through his body. He could feel small legs scrape against the delicate flesh of his vagina, and he felt his nausea peak as he saw the soft, translucent body of a plump centipede wriggle itself free from his body.   Their first child, finally hatched from the clutch of eggs nestled within Johnny. A long, segmented body--garishly red and lined with sharp legs--wound around the small centipede. Embracing it.   ""You're doing so good,"" Acid praised, his dark lipstick leaving bruise-like smudges upon Johnny's shoulder. ""I wonder how many we'll have? You're so big, there's got to be at least twenty crawling around in there.""   Another contraction, another agonized whine from Johnny. ""Make it stop,"" he pleaded. His eyes were wet, and the first tear rolled down his cheek as he felt the legs of a second centipede clawing its way out. He never had any desire for human children, let alone for a swarm of centipedes.   But Acid did, and Johnny simply had the misfortune of being the closest womb available.   The second centipede joined its sibling, leaving Johnny to the throes of his labor. Painted, clawed fingernails rubbed his thighs, but the soothing gesture meant nothing as Johnny thought of the ruins of his future.  Today's prompt is about a satyr since I never really wrote anything about satyrs before. The only really warning is that it's sexually explicit, and there's some alcohol involved. The satyr must fuck.  ""Follow the brown butterflies, and you'll meet a satyr.""  He ran his fingers through the curls of the satyr's hair and brushed his fingers against the delicate wings of the butterfly settled upon the creature's crown. Dark wine was sticky and heady upon both their lips. The satyr kissed him and savored that taste.  Grass tickled their flesh as they laid upon the earthen ground. The sun was low in the fire-orange sky, with the dense trees around them growing darker by the minute.  The narrow head of the satyr's cock pressed up against the man's anus, and then it was burrowing deep within him. His drunken gasp was easy, his limbs relaxed as he wound them around the satyr. The butterfly left the satyr's unkempt hair, and it spiraled into the sky.  It disappeared into the vibrant sunset, as though consumed by an inferno.  A breathy laugh left him as he watched the butterfly disappear, only for the delirious sound to transform into a moan. The satyr wasted no time in pounding into him. He felt like a growing wildfire, consuming more and more of the forest around them.  Soon he would join the fiery sunset as his orgasm burned away everything.  I got a bit carried away with this prompt since they're supposed to all be short. I mean, it's still short, but not as short as the others.  Warnings include a lot of violence and gore.  Sweat dripped from Artemis's brow as she scrabbled along the cavern wall.  The hunters had invaded  the den, and the pack was out hunting. She was alone, with the moonlit glow of her skin announcing her exact location. They hunters would find her, and they would slaughter her like a pig. As the superstition went, ""Consume the flesh of a witch cursed by the moon, and no disease will ever take you.""  The Lord Barrone was afraid of disease, justifiably so as more and more pustules sprouted upon his flesh like dandelions. He was dying, and he was desperate. He would do anything to escape his rapidly approaching fate, even if it involved devouring Artemis's cursed flesh.  Artemis shrieked as the hunter's torchlight fell upon her. His voice was loud and booming, and her terror turned his words into an incomprehensible blur. She heard more heavy footsteps. The hunters were gathering to claim their prey.  The men were soon upon her. Gloved hands grabbed her flaxen braids and yanked her arms behind her back. They wound coarse rope around her wrists, and when she screamed her contempt for their profane gods until one of the hunters smacked her. The leather stung, and she could feel an angry heat blossom upon one cheek.  ""Let's get out of here,"" one of the hunters said in a nasal, petulant voice. ""We don't want to be here when those wolves show up.""  ""I'm not afraid of the witch's lapdogs,"" the first of the hunters complained, but he offered no other protests. The men hoisted Artemis to her feet, and they dragged her from the cavern. Her dress was filthy and torn, and they shared cruel jokes among themselves over her unflattering appearance.  She wasn't one of the proper women from the village. She was unkempt and feral, and the curse marked her as incapable of the femininity the hunters hungered for. Artemis hoped their disgust would be a blessing in disguise. She hoped they would be too repulsed to take any pleasure from her, too bury their cocks in her unwilling body.  A wolf howled outside the cavern, and the nasal hunter swore under his breath. ""They're already here,"" he shouted, and Artemis heard the thin whine of anxiety. ""Those worthless scouts!""  ""How are we supposed to get the witch out of here then?"" one of the hunter's companions demanded, but no answer ever arrived. The wolves poured from the trees, as though summoned by Artemis's ethereal glow. They crossed the field with their long, powerful limbs, and then they were upon the cavern.  Upon the hunters.  Blades sliced into the wolves, and rifles fired bullets into their flesh, but they were unrelenting in their assault. Artemis knew the silver had to be a burning agony, but the wolves refused to yield. They tore open throats and pulled limbs from their sockets. The resultant screams were haunting. They were the wails of animals in their death throes.  Blood splattered upon Artemis's face as she fell to the muddy ground. She frantically rubbed the grime from her eyes, and then she looked at the savagery around her. Her heart pounded in her chest. She watched as the largest of the wolves, a graying creature littered with pale scars lifted the nasal hunter from the ground. The contemptible man was praying, the holy words a frantic babble from his bloodied lips.  The wolf snarled. He didn't know the gods of the hunters; the only divinity he knew was the moon-cursed woman on the ground. And so he squeezed the hunter's throat, crushing the man's esophagus and puncturing his arteries with sharpened claws. Blood sprayed from the hunter, and his body spasmed pathetically.  Artemis watched on with wide eyes. The bitter taste of nausea crept up her own throat, and she knew  nightmares of that blood would pursue her for as long as she lived.The wolves tore the rope from her raw wrists after ever hunter laid motionless upon the ground, but she couldn't even muster the words to offer her gratitude.  She could only think of death.  The deaths of the hunters, of the lord wasting away on his throne, and of her own.  One of the wolves leaned in close, and she lapped away the blood upon Artemis's face.  A short one today since my time is limited, but I hope you like creepy forests.  No warnings for this one, just trees.  The forest was dead--had been dead long before my grandfather purchased the land--and the bare trees were like bleached bones underneath the harsh sunlight. I wondered what they used to look like, covered in bark and green with life, but the idea seemed too preposterous. The trees once being anything but dead seemed like an outlandish fantasy.  They were dead, just as they'd always been dead.  The forest felt wrong with its absence of flora and fauna alike. I could walk among the trees in complete silence. No birds, no insects. Not even the howl of a wind. I could hear my blood pumping through my veins in that graveyard of trees,  I had a macabre fondness for that dessicated wilderness, but I only visited the trees during the day. At night the silence of the forest gave way to a sickly groan. The trees would yank themselves from the ground, roots as pale as the dead branches, and they would prowl the land that belonged to my grandfather in name only.  It's about dragons today, and I've decided it's also about extreme gore today. Be a responsible pet owner and feed you dragon.  Dark blood bubbled forth from Briar's chapped lips as he looked up at the dragon. His hands--his painfully small hands--smoothed over the creature's oil-black scales. His nerves were still singing their chorus of agony, but the melody was drawing to a close.    Shock, probably.   His organs were beautifully wet and shiny as they laid upon the ground, gravel clinging to them as the dragon kicked them aside with its powerful legs.  Spasms wracked Briar's narrow frame. His limbs grew weaker and weaker as his blood pooled around him. Briar's eyes felt heavy, like lead weights settled in the sockets of his skull.  The dragon leaned down and buried its muzzle in the fresh cavern of Briar's shredded abdomen. The creature didn't devour Briar, not yet. Dragons preferred to play with their meals before they gave into their hunger.  A wet rasp left Briar, his face blue and gray and wide-eyed. The dragon's scales blurred into one incomprehensible mass, and then--  And then--  The dragon opened its maw, and it began to feed.  I feel a little guilty, not having as long or meaningful stuff as I did for the last Monstrous May. I'm still going to hash out each of these prompts though, because I want to see the challenge to its end.  More violence and gore for this prompt. This May is starting to look less horny and more grisly.  Talons dug into the fat of her arms as the creature descended, all five eyes focused on her face. Her gun--a pretty Derringer with a lovingly engraved handle--fell from her fingers as shock took her. Her brother's corpse laid at her feet, belly already ruptured and skin a kaleidoscope of color.  She detested the idea of his corpse being fed to these disgusting creatures. She had wanted to chase the birds away, had wanted to take her brother and have him cremated instead.  The bird tore at her with its massive beak, taking away chunks of hair and leaving blood gashes instead. She screamed her frustration and pulled away from the creature, but it was relentless in its assault.  She stepped farther and farther from the bird, her brother's corpse forgotten until she stumbled against it, and then she was falling. She hit the ground with the resounding thud. Her breath left her lungs, and she looked around blindly. Her brother's body laid beside her, eyeless sockets oozing their decay.  She wanted to scream, but the bird swooped down upon her, claws taking her own eyes. She would face her death in darkness.  I watched the Trolls movie once because I thought the texture choices in the animation were legitimately fun. Overall I disliked the movie though.  This troll is nothing like those fun and colorful cartoony ones. I'm pretty sure any songs it sings would be about drinking blood from the skulls of humans it tears apart. Anyway, be forewarned for violent sexual assault and death.  The scent of meat boiling within the thick broth wafted through the air, and Daisy's heart pounded erratically in her chest. She could see the flesh of her friends floating to the surface, joined by a swirl of wild onions and dandelion greens.  How she had nearly joined them--and could still join them--until the troll decided her body had better uses. The rough wood of the table scraped at her back as the troll forced her legs apart, revealing her small cock and anus. The troll's eyes were small and entirely black, and Daisy couldn't read the intentions behind its stare. She could only understand the language of its fingers as they pinched at her cock and tugged at her balls.  Daisy pulled at the rope around her wrists, but the knots held. The skin was red and raw around the coarse rope, nearly as vivid as Daisy's dyed hair. She whined pitifully as she slammed her fists back against the table in frustration, but the troll was unphased.  One large finger brushed over her anus, and she felt a resurgence of nausea. The troll was too large and broad in every sense. She would be as torn to shreds as the bodies in the stew if it fucked her.  The troll cared little for her terror, if it cared at all. It forced that single finger into Daisy's unwilling body, and her shriek bounced off the cavern's walls. Her tender insides screamed their agony over the intrusion, and the claw threatened to puncture every spot it touched.  ""Take it out,"" Daisy begged, but the troll only huffed in response. Its cock was a behemoth even when flaccid.  It was no longer soft though.  The cock was swelling with arousal, becoming so engorged that Daisy could feel her own looming death as she gazed upon it. Nothing could prepare her for such girth.Perhaps after the troll killed her she would be tossed in that pot with her friends, her flesh seasoned by the troll's desire.  An impatient snarl left the troll as it forced a second finger into Daisy. It would tear her asunder in order to accommodate its cock.  I'm definitely rushing to force this story through, but also there's not a whole lot to warn for unless some cynicism about climate disaster applies.  I used to make tuna salad sandwiches for lunch, back before they went extinct. Nothing else quite matched the taste, but canned mermaid was close.  I pulled the tab, and the lid of the can peeled away to reveal the flaky meat contained within. The cartoon of the mermaid on the label was all bright colors, but the mermaid flesh itself was so pale it bordered on white.  The meat went into a bowl with a dollop of mayonnaise and minced onion. They blended together into a sea of white. An unappealing sight that made me long for the days when I still had tuna.  The store only had white bread, so I smeared the paste on a doughy slice. I covered it with a second slice, and then it disappeared into my well-used lunchbag with a couple crab apples from the tree outside.  I had seen documentaries about mermaids while staying up into the late hours of the night. They seemed so romantic in the cartoons of my childhood, with their human charm. But the mermaids that dominated the oceans were vacant-eyed and listless, more like any other fish than the singing princesses of my childhood.  It was a bit sad to see how I'd been duped into a humanistic majesty that never existed, but it did make the canned mermaid easier to swallow.  The can disappeared into the recycling bin, the cartoon mermaid's smile almost sarcastic in its cheeriness. Mermaids were still plentiful in the ocean, but I wondered how long they would continue to thrive. My childhood cartoons also neglected to capture all the variances of human nature.  How many of us consumed and consumed, leaving only extinction and adorable cans in our wake? And it was so easy to consume when working seventy hours a week gave me time for nothing else.  I left my little apartment for the flooded streets below, like a mermaid of the city as I carried my lunchbag in one hand.  Today is a short one, but I wanted to write something about a monster that thrives in the dark. Be forewarned for some sexual content.  Hands like shadows wandered over Amihan's dark, tattoo-littered skin. They teased at the lines of black and red and violet, the shaded pomegranates and bones. The hallway was so dark that she couldn't tell if her eyes were even open. All she could do was lean forward and brace herself against the brick wall.  One hand slipped under her pleather skirt, and the wispy fingers tugged at her scant panties. More hands ventured beneath her ratty shirt. Her nipples were hard beneath the chilled touches of the fingers, the small of her back yielding to one wide palm.  Amihan's painted lips parted as a surprised gasp left her, and two fingers intruded upon the heat of her wet mouth. She didn't know what these creatures exploring her body looked like--maybe they were indistinguishable from the darkness itself.  Fingers slid past her panties, and she whined as the chill of those creatures breached the intimate folds of her sex.  The cold of the hallway couldn't touch her then, not as the fingers labored over the fire growing within her.  I wrote a tiny piece about zombies today. Be warned for gore and death that's typical of zombie settings.  The embalmer's head fell back, and the gash along his throat spread into a visceral grin. Maggots glistened among the rotting flesh like a set of teeth. Not everyone could host the maggots as they developed into adults, and the embalmer was one such case. Despite this the repulsive creatures would still tried to take control of his corpse. They wriggled deeper and deeper into this flesh.  Kayde watched as the corpse's hands twitched ineffectually. The insects couldn't force the embalmer to do anything more substantial. ""Think we should burn the body anyway?"" Luanne asked, her southern drawl muffled by the hazmat suit. ""Don't think he's going anywhere, but can't be too sure.""  ""We don't have that much gas left,"" Kayde responded. ""Let's just leave him. If they're infecting him they're not infecting anyone they can actually move.""  Luanne hummed to herself. ""Is that how it works?"" she asked, and she prodded the corpse with a broom handle. The embalmer's abdomen was swollen and straining against the buttons of his ruined shirt.  Kayde turned from the body and shifted the duffel bag slung over his shoulder. ""Stop that,"" he chided. ""The last thing we need is that shit exploding on us."" Even if the embalmer couldn't move there were plenty of corpses that could move lurking throughout the neighborhood, shambling around at the behest of the insects burrowed in their decomposing flesh.  And Kayde didn't want the swarmed to be alerted to their presence when the emtvrbalmer burst. One corpse might be harmless, but a swarm could overpower them--could tear away their hazmat suits and vomit clusters of translucent eggs down their throats.  Luanne whined her protest, but she dropped the broom handle. Unlike Kayde, she derived a macabre pleasure from the death and decay that now defined their world. Her delight made his stomach roll with nausea.  ""Don't be gross,"" Kayde rebuked, and he walked away.  I didn't have much an idea for today, so it's something really short today. Nothing really needing a warning, unless zombies are an issue.  The farther he descended into the waters the deeper the chill permeated his flesh. All the while the shark's rough scales brushed against him. It was too dark to see the predator, but he could imagine its rotted face--its empty eye sockets and cartilage poking forth from the decay.  Curiosity had its price, and his body would be offered up to pay that debt. The shark would make certain of that.  Man, I don't even know what to say about this one. Warnings for some language that verges in self-harm ideation, I guess. And unreality.   ""I need to speak to you.""   I found those five words scrawled over and over throughout my apartment. Upon the aging fridge and cupboards, scrawling along the hallway walls, upon the bedroom ceiling. All in the same garish red, the same looping letters.    ""I need to speak to you.""   The windows were sealed shut, and the door immobile upon it's hinges. I was a prisoner in a house without an exit, no matter how hard I pounded on the window-glass and hammered at the door.    ""I need to speak with you.""   The specter repeated those words like a mantra. I wondered if those words were even carved into my bones. If I peeled away my skin and muscles would that same distinct writing be there, etched down into the marrow?    ""I need to speak with you.""   I ate the remaining saltines in the cupboards and I drank tap water straight from the faucet. I reread the same books about burning farms and young girls running through swirling ash. I scribbled out the reappearing red requests with the stubs of crayons.    ""I need to speak with you.""   The words appeared the most at sunset, when the sky outside was an inferno and the clouds were thick tendrils of smoke. Every demand I crossed out was replaced by a new one.    ""I need to speak with you.""   When I ran out of crayons I broke the lightbulbs. I retreated to a darkness where the words could not touch me. If the words cut through that darkness--if they started to glow like the sunset or the burning fires or my ghastly white bones--then I would gouge out my eyes.    ""I need to speak with you.""   Those words would have to be written on my empty sockets, into the tender flesh that once cradled my eyes.    ""I need to speak with you.""   My house smelled of ash, and I could imagine the hands behind those words having that same scent. Fingers that spoke a language of destruction, even when writing five otherwise innocuous words.  ""I need to speak with you.""  Look, I was gonna use this prompt to write about Jude and the Fairy. Of course I was.  As far as warnings go there's some light sexual content here.  Jude's hand smoothed over the Fairy's calf as his lips settled upon her knobbly knee. The bedroom smelled of nail polish, and the bottle was forgotten by Jude's crouched form. The Fairy's nails were like opals in the incandescent light, immaculate in contrast to the black paint chipping on Jude's own fingernails.  The Fairy raised her hands high above her head, and she marveled at the ethereal rainbow contained within that nail polish. She sat upon the bed, like a ghost against the dark blankets. ""Pretty,"" she breathed. Her white pupils were invisible among the milky sea of her eyes, but Jude could still tell how focused they were on the paint.  She'd always been fascinated by his own painted nails. Supposedly the fairies had no cosmetics of their own, only gauzy white garments and strands of teeth to adorn their colorless bodies, so the world of makeup was a constant mystery to the Fairy.  ""I thought you'd like that one,"" Jude murmured. The nail polishes he wore were all dark and simple colors--black, dark blue, khaki green, and royal purple--so he'd purchased that shade just for her.  He wondered what else she would like. Would she enjoy eyeshadow that shimmered like the sea? How would she feel about lipstick, with even the palest colors vibrant against her tooth-white skin?  His hand ventured down her calf and cradled her pronounced ankle. Jude was mindful of her drying toenails as he handled her tiny foot.  The Fairy looked back down at Jude. Her still-damp hair hung in long tendrils, unlike the curls that never left Jude's own tousled mane. The heat of the bath might have long left them, but Jude could feel a new warmth spread across his chest and face as he kissed the Fairy's knee again before moving his lips to the soft flesh of her thigh.  The smallest of smiles graced the Fairy as she spread her legs. The lips of her sex were an endearing sight, and the slick opening nestled between them made Jude's mouth water, just as it always did.  ""You're always so good to me,"" the Fairy said, voice like an ethereal melody. She always sounded like the wind and spring rain somehow condensed into a single being. Jude kissed her thigh again and again, creeping ever closer to her delicate pussy.  ""I love you,"" he murmured, and he could hear her soft laugh in response.  ""And I love you,"" the Fairy replied, and her eyes slipped shut as Jude's mouth descended upon those inviting folds. Her hands splayed upon the flannel blanket as she minded the painted nails.  I didn't have much of a plan for this one. I just remembered a time when some clouds in the sky looked like a castle.  No real warnings for this one.   Offer three bundles of black grapes and a moonstone bathed into storm water to the maiden of the Loess Cliffs. Kneel before the statue, clap three times, and then the Lord's castle will appear.   The dewy blades of grass clung to Sienna's bare legs as she looked up at the weather-worn statue. She clapped her callused hands--once, twice, thrice--and closed her eyes. The statue's passive face was immobile as always. It looked to the night sky, at the stars as pale as its granite surface.  Knobbly hands like dark clouds descended from the sky, like the seeking grasp of an unnamed god. And then it appeared between those fingers.  The silhouette of a castle, darker than the indigo sky itself. Windows like starlight, the entire majesty hanging upside-down between those hands.  Sienna disappeared then. The hands spirited her away to the phantom in the sky, with the statue's stoic gaze revealing nothing.  I guess I need to warn for some light body horror with this one. Or maybe it's not light at all, maybe it's pure body horror.  Oh well. be cautious of body parts doing what body parts should not be doing.  I could hear the call of the sirens, the song like a drone burrowing into the whorls of my brain. The stories of their song being an achingly beautiful melody was a myth, a fiction to obscure the truth of those repulsive creatures that lined the beach.  They stared at my lit windows with their sunken, storm-gray eyes, teeth stained with old blood as they serenaded me. Their voices were foghorns over the crashing waves as they sang their complex words, all from a language older than the ocean itself.  The music made my head pound, as though my brain itself was hammering against my confining skull. I wanted to take a chisel to my forehead to chip the bone away and free my brain from its prison. I wondered how it would look--how the call of the sirens reshaped the tender gray curls.  Would I hear their same song come from deep within my brain, that same eerie foghorn bellowing over the ocean waves?  I'm here, I'm here. Sorry, I was distracted today. Guess be mindful of unreality today, and maybe some light body horror.  Her smile widened, her blue-white teeth large in her mouth. I always tried to count her teeth--she always seemed to have too many--but time and time again I lost count. ""We missed you at the meeting,"" she said, her thin lips nearly invisible as they stretched to reveal those teeth. ""Were you feeling sick again?""  ""Oh. Uh, yeah,"" I answered, and I wished she would leave already. I'd had worse neighbors in my life, but her persistence had a way of burrowing under my skin. Plus, she had ulterior motives.  Her face contorted into a mockery of sympathy. ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,"" she cooed. The wind tugged at the bleached wisps of her hair, pulling them free from her immaculately styled bob. ""Maybe next time then? There's been concerns about the disappearances in our community, and I think your involvement would be so helpful.""  Her mouth closed and I lost count of those teeth. I think I'd counted thirty along that top row, but I was no longer sure. ""Oh, the dog attacks?"" I said as I crouched down to check my little flower box. The pansies looked up at me with their disgruntled faces, all white and yellow and purple. ""You know I don't have any dogs.""  The corner of her mouth twitched. ""Yes, the dog attacks,"" she replied, and for a brief moment she looked irritated. It was the only sincere expression I'd ever seen her make. ""Well, even if you don't have a dog you might have seen something we haven't."" Her smile returned, and I looked at the bottom row of her teeth. The countless teeth, all perfectly straight and brilliant.  ""I doubt it."" I said. ""But I guess I'll let you know if anything comes up.""     She closed her mouth again, and I forgot how many teeth I'd counted, just as I always did.  Today sucks, here's a quick bit of undead wraith porn.  Elijah braced himself against the crumbling wall as the wraith's knobbly hand lifted his leg higher and higher, spreading Elijah so wide that his hips protested the stretch. Elijah would have toppled over if not for the mausoleum.   The wraith's cock protruded from layers of their white robe, the fabric gauzy and rotted from time. Even the rush of arousal brought warmth to the creature's gray skin. Elijah's eyes still fluttered shut though as the head breached the folds of his pussy. ""Yeah, like that,"" he breathed even though he knew the wraith wouldn't answer him.   The wraith's dirty nails instead dug into the ample flesh of his thigh as they pressed the entirety of their cock into Elijah. They moved slowly, as though the rapid thrusts that Elijah was so used to would destroy the wraith's fragile body.   And so the creature fucked Elijah slowly and tenderly.  I wanted to write Beelzebub porn, and so I wrote Beelzebub porn. I also threw in some fun painplay and also probably some light blasphemy.  The angel tilted their head back as a shaky gasp left them, a sound that reverberated off the high ceilings of the throne room. They were a scrap of divinity--barely more holy than the humans that reigned over the earth with their chaotic impulses.  Beelzebub dragged one of his long, spindly claws across the angel's chest. The glowing skin split, and golden ichor welled up within the wound. It spilled in rivulets over the angel's soft belly and over the triangle of their pubic mound. The angel made a pained sound, but their expression only spoke of euphoria. They were in the throes of ecstasy, as though they were communing with their God and not the Lord of the Flies.  Beelzebub's chitinous fingers combed through the angel's ashen hair. He had multiple consorts. Humans as dark as the night sky, humans with hair the red-orange of roaring wildfire. Artists with paint-stained fingers and farmers tanned from a life under the sun. Muscular men and fat women and sharp-boned androgynes. The devout and the cynical. The passionate and the apathetic.  They embodied the plethora of human experiences, his beloved consorts. The angel was different though; they were the first divine creature to share his bed.  The angel's fingers slipped free from their anus. The hole twitched, glistening and pleading for Beelzebub's cock. The angel didn't say anything, just as they never did. Their words were a secret that even Beelzebub couldn't unravel.  He took his cock in his hand, the entire length a disconcerting amalgamation of red and pink swirls. The head pressed against that waiting anus, forcing its way into the angel's body. A sob left the angel as the cock stretched them beyond their limits. Beelzebub was so large, and the angel was so small.  His red compound eyes drank in the sight of the angel in that state of both ecstasy and anguish, and all the while the heat that sheathed his cock burned. It was holy fire, and his demon blood shrieked within its vicinity. The pain was bliss for him in the way it was bliss for the angel. They were two masochists seeking each other out for more glorious pain and suffering.  Beelzebub's claws tore at the angel's fleshy hips as he began to fuck him. His lovely new consort moaned their satisfaction, ethereal as they bounced upon the demon's cock.  A prompt is a prompt, and I've written something. No major warnings, it's just a scrap of an idea.  Hands beneath the river, formed of mud and fish bones and rusted cans.     They grabbed at my legs and pulled me under.     Brown water filled my lungs as I slipped further and further into that polluted kingdom.  No real warnings again, save for a creepy garden gnome. I really, really, REALLY didn't know what to do with this one.  I hated that garden gnome. It's yellow shirt was bleached white by the sun, and the paint was flaking off in large chunks. At one point it might have been smiling, but nature had destroyed its face. An eroded chasm existed now dominated its head. It was an eyesore among the roses and marigolds and the tiny vegetable patch, but my mother was attached to the little monstrosity. A gift from her father when he was still alive, she said.  I looked out the kitchen window and to the garden gnome. A tiny wren clambered into the gnome, and like every other creature that dared to explore that abyss I knew it wouldn't reappear. The tomatoes were beautifully red, and the peppers blended into the plants' lush greenery.  My mother was at the table, cup of coffee between her brittle hands. Her smile widened after the wren vanished. And then she took another sip of her drink.  I burned my hand today, so I didn't really want to write, and I couldn't really get into writing monster plant porn even though that's a brand of horny I really like.  But there is some smut here, so it's okay.  Adalia sighed--oh that beautiful sigh--as she sank down upon those green tendrils unfurling from the vine. She was alone in her boudoir, with the plant basking before the large window as her only companion.  Her preferred companion, if she was honest. The men that vied for her attention were obnoxious in their confidence, in how they talked at her without so much as pausing to let her respond.  The tendrils slipped past her folds and into her waiting body. They explored her sex gingerly, with a gentleness she received from no one else.  Her breasts spilled over her brocade corset. Adalia's nipples were as rosy as the blooms that covered her lover. She wanted to curl up within one of those flowers, safe and distanced from the world she increasingly despised.  The tendrils then began to thrust into Adalia, and she soon devolved into a series of gasps and squeals.  I'm honestly surprised I've made it so far with this set of prompts, even though it's because a lot of them have been exceptionally short. It's still nice to see.  Sexual content is ahead, but it's nothing major.  They lived alone in the ruins of the workshop. Their creator had died years ago--heart having ruptured within his frail body--and so they'd took over the work he'd started.  Neither Mercury nor Jupiter had their creator's talent though. Every doll they made never became more than a collection of joints and limbs and blank glass eyes. Life never crystallized within their creations in the way that it had manifested within themselves.  And so they became accustomed to their seclusion. No siblings would ever join them within the decaying laboratory. Mercury and Jupiter only had each other.  Mercury shivered as he laid upon the workshop table, legs spread to display the lovingly carved curves and folds of his sex. Their lovemaking was a hollow imitation of humanity's, less performed out of desire and more out of habit. Their creator had loved being sandwiched between Mercury and Jupiter as he'd taken from their bodies.  Jupiter's cock slipped inside Mercury, and the two dolls entwined their limbs around each other as they fucked on that workshop table where the bodies of their failed siblings had once lain. The room was bleak with it's water-stained ceiling and moldy walls, but neither doll took note of the decay.  I already kind of had a story with about angels, but that was for another prompt. This one is fine, it's a good chunk of body horror, because my favorite type of angels are the surreal body horror type.  Claws like needles of light punctured my flesh, and I smelled the faint scent of cooking meat. The angels of my mother's ceramic collection--delicate figures with wide eyes and white wings--were nowhere to be seen in this deplorable kingdom of heaven.  They stared at me with their infinite eyes as they sang in voices like the chimes of church bells. The claws left my skin. Blood welled up from the countless wounds, as though to herald the glassy eyes that then emerged from the gore. They gazed both everywhere and nowhere, the dark pupils framed by eerily pale blue.  A mosaic of mouths curved into appreciative smiles as my body transformed into the monstrous divine. ""Holy, holy, holy,"" they sang.  I'm emotionally fried, and I don't have much to say about today's prompt. It probably deserves more attention than I gave it. Oh well.  No warnings for this one.  I laid my small hands upon the wall, and I could feel the hum. The swarms moved beneath the layers of insulation and drywall and velvet-flocked wallpaper. The vibrations were a chorus, each of those small creatures speaking in unison.  My hands spasmed in pain, so I clenched and reopened them until the tendons resettled. The hum always sank into my flesh until my bones themselves were rattling. I hated the sound, just as I hated the decay of the apartment.  But the rent was cheap.  I didn't really know what to do with this, so I brought back Raoul and the King for the occasion. No real warnings here, which is surprising given uh, the dynamic between these two.  Raoul ran his hands over the cool gold bars of his cage. The king was sleeping, as large as a mountain upon his bed. Sometimes the giant would sleep the days away, as though he couldn't bear the sight of his ruined kingdom. He was, after all, alone save for the farmer he kept imprisoned like a song bird.  Even the embers within the fireplace had long since died. The winter chill seeped into the bedchamber without the fire to keep it at bay. Raoul stepped away from the bars, and he crawled back under the blankets and pelts upon his bed. The giant saw Raoul as little more than a toy to humor him during his lonely days, but at least he kept Raoul well-fed and warm.  He buried his face between one of the blankets and blocked out the sight of the cavernous room. He could hear the king's snores. The sound made the entire bedchamber vibrate, and Raoul let the noise enshroud him just as the pelts and blankets did.  It's sex today. Beasts get to be horny too.  The Beast of the Smaragdos Wilds was described as a patchwork quilt of various animals. The wings of a raven and the paws of a bear. The sleek musculature of a cougar and the muzzle of a wolf. And red, red fur--brilliant like a fox's.  But no one had ever mentioned the Beast's eyes, how they were like polished obsidian set in that monstrous skull.  Amber saw those eyes time and time again. They were beautiful, just as the rest of the Beast was beautiful.  How could she have ever resisted the Beast's embrace?  The creature was sprawled out within its den, eyes appraising Amber with that mysterious gaze as she ran her hands through its thick fur. Fingers ventured between the Beast's legs, and they eventually found the long slit of its pussy. Amber's mouth watered at the sight.  How could she have ever resisted bringing her lips to the Beast's sex and tasted the heat that no other human did?She teased at the delicate folds that framed that opening, and her tongue plunged into the Beast. A rumble left the creature--a content sound that Amber basked in. The fur tickled her face, but she ignored the sensation. Only that pussy mattered to her.  The Beast of the Smaragdos Wilds devoured all humans that ventured into its domain, but in the cavern it was instead the prey. And Amber feasted upon the Beast.  I'm close to done. I wish I'd had more time to invest in this, but the prompts have been fun. No warnings for this one either, I guess.  The river was my beloved and my beloved alone. Even as the prairie erupted into an inferno she was there for me, a sanctuary in the midst of the orange flames and pillars of dark smoke. I sank into her embrace as the cries of crows echoed overhead.  The cabin was forsaken, as were the bodies within. My parents had been lost even before the fire consumed their bloated corpses. I'd been abandoned with not even a spare bullet to return me to my family.  Hands emerged from the water and cradled my soot-streaked and charred body. The smoke burned my throat and lungs, but then the river kissed me. Those lips were a balm for my aching body, and I slipped deep into the water.  I'm bringing back Asterion and Bronte for this one because I didn't have any other ideas. Consequently there's some sexual content here. Bronte getting the dick they want.  Bronte knelt before the Minotaur, knees scuffed and streaked with dirt, and their pink tongue flicked out over the broad head of the creature's cock. That arousal was too long and too thick for Bronte to even dream to taking it into their mouth, but they still delighted in lapping at the imposing cock. The taste of salt and skin was addictive, as was the content huffs that left the Minotaur.  Their tongue laved over the pronounced veins and it teased at the slit. How many times had Bronte braced themself against a labyrinth wall and yowled as that cock plunged into them, reshaping their insides until they were cradling the entirety of its weight.  Bronte could spend the rest of their existence worshiping that cock. They reached down and palmed at their own small, soft cock as they continued to kneel down before the Minotaur, lips and tongue unceasing.  A day late, but it's here, and now the challenge has come to a close. No real warnings for this one, except for maybe body horror?  All five bodies were laid to rest in their shallow graves, all in a neat row. A doctor, a set of twins, a taxidermist,  and a camgirl. The freshly disturbed earth was as dark as the sky above. The soil offered a sanctuary from the lit world above, both for the corpses and the worms.  And those worms, so translucent that their delicate organs were visible, burrowed into the bodies offered to them. They feasted upon the decaying flesh, their segmented bodies swelling more and more. Pustules sprouted upon the worms, their skin incapable of obscuring the red growths forming within. They were embryos, the union of the worms and the corpses.  Those embryos would be nourished by the bodies, and soon, when they were large enough to survive on their own, they would burst from the worms. They would escape the dark earth then, with the night sky greeting them as they crawled out to the land above.";;;1;0;0;0;semantic;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

It oozed from the cracks, and she felt her anger return as she watched the blood trickle down her arm.  She thought of that man's audacity--of how he brought his club down upon her fragile body--and the contempt that sloshed within Ilona's body almost made her crawl back out of that casket. Almost made her return to the streets with her broken body, all to find the man that nearly destroyed her and tear out his throat. Her body might be damaged, but her teeth were still wondrously sharp. The man's flesh would yield easily to the diamond points.  Ilona didn't leave the safety of the casket though. The dollmaker could only mend so many cracks before she would have to replace parts of Ilona's body entirely, and new limbs took months to acclimate to. She would be even less equipped to take revenge upon the abhorrent man if her arms refused to move.  So she remained in her casket, her sanctuary. Ilona closed her eyes, and she imagined the glass orbs rattling about in her hollow skull.    No.   They were more likely floating in a sea of blood. The dollmaker said she was more ravenous than the previous dolls--her siblings. Ilona couldn't resist the call of the blood though. The dollmaker's own blood might have been too thin and bland to be palatable, but the city was filled with far more delectable people. Ilona particularly savored blood laced with dark wine, with bourbon and vodka and heavy beer.  That was, after all, why she'd initially targeted that man. He was a regular at Loretta's, and she could always smell the beer upon his breath.    Good beer.   How was she supposed to know the drunkard could defend himself?  She rested her hands upon her chest, the lovingly carved fingers growing numb as more blood flowed from her body. Her green dress was probably stained beyond repair.  Ilona vowed to make the man suffer for ruining her dress. Perhaps she'd gouge his equally green eyes from his gaunt face before she tore him to shreds. A quick death seemed too merciful.  Her fingers twitched once, twice, and then they stilled.  Second day, second prompt. There's some sexual content here, but nothing major, unless we're considering doppelganger sex to be incest. Then there's incest here, I guess.  The other Ash Holliday slept under the bed. Ash couldn't explain why a doppelganger of themself existed, nor could they answer why the creature was most comfortable on the cold floor, curled up beside Ash's collection of colorful sneakers. They could only shrug and accept the doppelganger's existence as a truth without explanation.  Ash opened their eyes as they felt the touch of cool, chubby hands upon their face. They weren't sleeping--not really. The doppelganger always left its nest at the stroke of midnight. The creature crawled onto the bed, and it straddled Ash's hips. It was a being defined by strict routines.  The doppelganger's lips were cold upon Ash's own. It might have been a reflection of Ash's own plain appearance, all unremarkable eyes and lank hair, but it lacked Ash's warmth. The doppelganger had no life pumping through its own veins.  It had to seek Ash for heat.  For life.  A low, content sigh left Ash as the doppelganger's hand slipped beneath the blankets and discovered the plump lips of their sex. ""Incorrigible,"" they murmured, but they still spread their legs to give the doppelganger better access to their pussy.  The doppelganger didn't answer them. It was incapable of speech--the loudest sounds it could muster being nothing more than breathy rasps. Anyone eavesdropping upon the lascivious scene in that bedroom would only ever hear Ash's low moans.  Ash wound their arms around the doppelganger, and the mattress groaned as the two became entangled.  Beneath them, under the mattress, laid the mess of Ash's shoes. A hand mirror, long forgotten by Ash, laid among the heap of bright canvas and dingy shoelaces, the polished surface as chilly as the doppelganger itself.  So, uh. In my defense, I had this written before the Roe v. Wade news last night. The forced pregnancy is coincidental. If that's an issue then give this story a pass.  Other warnings include the implication of past rape and body horror. And centipedes, if that bothers you.  This short piece is a continuation of a story I wrote for the Like It Or Not zine. Johnny just continuing to have a horrible life.  ""That's right, baby,"" Acid purred, hands holding Johnny's thighs spread and ratted hair tickling the back of his captive's neck. ""Just take those deep breaths.""   Johnny didn't respond to the creature. He instead bit back a pained sob as another contraction rolled through his body. He could feel small legs scrape against the delicate flesh of his vagina, and he felt his nausea peak as he saw the soft, translucent body of a plump centipede wriggle itself free from his body.   Their first child, finally hatched from the clutch of eggs nestled within Johnny. A long, segmented body--garishly red and lined with sharp legs--wound around the small centipede. Embracing it.   ""You're doing so good,"" Acid praised, his dark lipstick leaving bruise-like smudges upon Johnny's shoulder. ""I wonder how many we'll have? You're so big, there's got to be at least twenty crawling around in there.""   Another contraction, another agonized whine from Johnny. ""Make it stop,"" he pleaded. His eyes were wet, and the first tear rolled down his cheek as he felt the legs of a second centipede clawing its way out. He never had any desire for human children, let alone for a swarm of centipedes.   But Acid did, and Johnny simply had the misfortune of being the closest womb available.   The second centipede joined its sibling, leaving Johnny to the throes of his labor. Painted, clawed fingernails rubbed his thighs, but the soothing gesture meant nothing as Johnny thought of the ruins of his future.  Today's prompt is about a satyr since I never really wrote anything about satyrs before. The only really warning is that it's sexually explicit, and there's some alcohol involved. The satyr must fuck.  ""Follow the brown butterflies, and you'll meet a satyr.""  He ran his fingers through the curls of the satyr's hair and brushed his fingers against the delicate wings of the butterfly settled upon the creature's crown. Dark wine was sticky and heady upon both their lips. The satyr kissed him and savored that taste.  Grass tickled their flesh as they laid upon the earthen ground. The sun was low in the fire-orange sky, with the dense trees around them growing darker by the minute.  The narrow head of the satyr's cock pressed up against the man's anus, and then it was burrowing deep within him. His drunken gasp was easy, his limbs relaxed as he wound them around the satyr. The butterfly left the satyr's unkempt hair, and it spiraled into the sky.  It disappeared into the vibrant sunset, as though consumed by an inferno.  A breathy laugh left him as he watched the butterfly disappear, only for the delirious sound to transform into a moan. The satyr wasted no time in pounding into him. He felt like a growing wildfire, consuming more and more of the forest around them.  Soon he would join the fiery sunset as his orgasm burned away everything.  I got a bit carried away with this prompt since they're supposed to all be short. I mean, it's still short, but not as short as the others.  Warnings include a lot of violence and gore.  Sweat dripped from Artemis's brow as she scrabbled along the cavern wall.  The hunters had invaded  the den, and the pack was out hunting. She was alone, with the moonlit glow of her skin announcing her exact location. They hunters would find her, and they would slaughter her like a pig. As the superstition went, ""Consume the flesh of a witch cursed by the moon, and no disease will ever take you.""  The Lord Barrone was afraid of disease, justifiably so as more and more pustules sprouted upon his flesh like dandelions. He was dying, and he was desperate. He would do anything to escape his rapidly approaching fate, even if it involved devouring Artemis's cursed flesh.  Artemis shrieked as the hunter's torchlight fell upon her. His voice was loud and booming, and her terror turned his words into an incomprehensible blur. She heard more heavy footsteps. The hunters were gathering to claim their prey.  The men were soon upon her. Gloved hands grabbed her flaxen braids and yanked her arms behind her back. They wound coarse rope around her wrists, and when she screamed her contempt for their profane gods until one of the hunters smacked her. The leather stung, and she could feel an angry heat blossom upon one cheek.  ""Let's get out of here,"" one of the hunters said in a nasal, petulant voice. ""We don't want to be here when those wolves show up.""  ""I'm not afraid of the witch's lapdogs,"" the first of the hunters complained, but he offered no other protests. The men hoisted Artemis to her feet, and they dragged her from the cavern. Her dress was filthy and torn, and they shared cruel jokes among themselves over her unflattering appearance.  She wasn't one of the proper women from the village. She was unkempt and feral, and the curse marked her as incapable of the femininity the hunters hungered for. Artemis hoped their disgust would be a blessing in disguise. She hoped they would be too repulsed to take any pleasure from her, too bury their cocks in her unwilling body.  A wolf howled outside the cavern, and the nasal hunter swore under his breath. ""They're already here,"" he shouted, and Artemis heard the thin whine of anxiety. ""Those worthless scouts!""  ""How are we supposed to get the witch out of here then?"" one of the hunter's companions demanded, but no answer ever arrived. The wolves poured from the trees, as though summoned by Artemis's ethereal glow. They crossed the field with their long, powerful limbs, and then they were upon the cavern.  Upon the hunters.  Blades sliced into the wolves, and rifles fired bullets into their flesh, but they were unrelenting in their assault. Artemis knew the silver had to be a burning agony, but the wolves refused to yield. They tore open throats and pulled limbs from their sockets. The resultant screams were haunting. They were the wails of animals in their death throes.  Blood splattered upon Artemis's face as she fell to the muddy ground. She frantically rubbed the grime from her eyes, and then she looked at the savagery around her. Her heart pounded in her chest. She watched as the largest of the wolves, a graying creature littered with pale scars lifted the nasal hunter from the ground. The contemptible man was praying, the holy words a frantic babble from his bloodied lips.  The wolf snarled. He didn't know the gods of the hunters; the only divinity he knew was the moon-cursed woman on the ground. And so he squeezed the hunter's throat, crushing the man's esophagus and puncturing his arteries with sharpened claws. Blood sprayed from the hunter, and his body spasmed pathetically.  Artemis watched on with wide eyes. The bitter taste of nausea crept up her own throat, and she knew  nightmares of that blood would pursue her for as long as she lived.The wolves tore the rope from her raw wrists after ever hunter laid motionless upon the ground, but she couldn't even muster the words to offer her gratitude.  She could only think of death.  The deaths of the hunters, of the lord wasting away on his throne, and of her own.  One of the wolves leaned in close, and she lapped away the blood upon Artemis's face.  A short one today since my time is limited, but I hope you like creepy forests.  No warnings for this one, just trees.  The forest was dead--had been dead long before my grandfather purchased the land--and the bare trees were like bleached bones underneath the harsh sunlight. I wondered what they used to look like, covered in bark and green with life, but the idea seemed too preposterous. The trees once being anything but dead seemed like an outlandish fantasy.  They were dead, just as they'd always been dead.  The forest felt wrong with its absence of flora and fauna alike. I could walk among the trees in complete silence. No birds, no insects. Not even the howl of a wind. I could hear my blood pumping through my veins in that graveyard of trees,  I had a macabre fondness for that dessicated wilderness, but I only visited the trees during the day. At night the silence of the forest gave way to a sickly groan. The trees would yank themselves from the ground, roots as pale as the dead branches, and they would prowl the land that belonged to my grandfather in name only.  It's about dragons today, and I've decided it's also about extreme gore today. Be a responsible pet owner and feed you dragon.  Dark blood bubbled forth from Briar's chapped lips as he looked up at the dragon. His hands--his painfully small hands--smoothed over the creature's oil-black scales. His nerves were still singing their chorus of agony, but the melody was drawing to a close.    Shock, probably.   His organs were beautifully wet and shiny as they laid upon the ground, gravel clinging to them as the dragon kicked them aside with its powerful legs.  Spasms wracked Briar's narrow frame. His limbs grew weaker and weaker as his blood pooled around him. Briar's eyes felt heavy, like lead weights settled in the sockets of his skull.  The dragon leaned down and buried its muzzle in the fresh cavern of Briar's shredded abdomen. The creature didn't devour Briar, not yet. Dragons preferred to play with their meals before they gave into their hunger.  A wet rasp left Briar, his face blue and gray and wide-eyed. The dragon's scales blurred into one incomprehensible mass, and then--  And then--  The dragon opened its maw, and it began to feed.  I feel a little guilty, not having as long or meaningful stuff as I did for the last Monstrous May. I'm still going to hash out each of these prompts though, because I want to see the challenge to its end.  More violence and gore for this prompt. This May is starting to look less horny and more grisly.  Talons dug into the fat of her arms as the creature descended, all five eyes focused on her face. Her gun--a pretty Derringer with a lovingly engraved handle--fell from her fingers as shock took her. Her brother's corpse laid at her feet, belly already ruptured and skin a kaleidoscope of color.  She detested the idea of his corpse being fed to these disgusting creatures. She had wanted to chase the birds away, had wanted to take her brother and have him cremated instead.  The bird tore at her with its massive beak, taking away chunks of hair and leaving blood gashes instead. She screamed her frustration and pulled away from the creature, but it was relentless in its assault.  She stepped farther and farther from the bird, her brother's corpse forgotten until she stumbled against it, and then she was falling. She hit the ground with the resounding thud. Her breath left her lungs, and she looked around blindly. Her brother's body laid beside her, eyeless sockets oozing their decay.  She wanted to scream, but the bird swooped down upon her, claws taking her own eyes. She would face her death in darkness.  I watched the Trolls movie once because I thought the texture choices in the animation were legitimately fun. Overall I disliked the movie though.  This troll is nothing like those fun and colorful cartoony ones. I'm pretty sure any songs it sings would be about drinking blood from the skulls of humans it tears apart. Anyway, be forewarned for violent sexual assault and death.  The scent of meat boiling within the thick broth wafted through the air, and Daisy's heart pounded erratically in her chest. She could see the flesh of her friends floating to the surface, joined by a swirl of wild onions and dandelion greens.  How she had nearly joined them--and could still join them--until the troll decided her body had better uses. The rough wood of the table scraped at her back as the troll forced her legs apart, revealing her small cock and anus. The troll's eyes were small and entirely black, and Daisy couldn't read the intentions behind its stare. She could only understand the language of its fingers as they pinched at her cock and tugged at her balls.  Daisy pulled at the rope around her wrists, but the knots held. The skin was red and raw around the coarse rope, nearly as vivid as Daisy's dyed hair. She whined pitifully as she slammed her fists back against the table in frustration, but the troll was unphased.  One large finger brushed over her anus, and she felt a resurgence of nausea. The troll was too large and broad in every sense. She would be as torn to shreds as the bodies in the stew if it fucked her.  The troll cared little for her terror, if it cared at all. It forced that single finger into Daisy's unwilling body, and her shriek bounced off the cavern's walls. Her tender insides screamed their agony over the intrusion, and the claw threatened to puncture every spot it touched.  ""Take it out,"" Daisy begged, but the troll only huffed in response. Its cock was a behemoth even when flaccid.  It was no longer soft though.  The cock was swelling with arousal, becoming so engorged that Daisy could feel her own looming death as she gazed upon it. Nothing could prepare her for such girth.Perhaps after the troll killed her she would be tossed in that pot with her friends, her flesh seasoned by the troll's desire.  An impatient snarl left the troll as it forced a second finger into Daisy. It would tear her asunder in order to accommodate its cock.  I'm definitely rushing to force this story through, but also there's not a whole lot to warn for unless some cynicism about climate disaster applies.  I used to make tuna salad sandwiches for lunch, back before they went extinct. Nothing else quite matched the taste, but canned mermaid was close.  I pulled the tab, and the lid of the can peeled away to reveal the flaky meat contained within. The cartoon of the mermaid on the label was all bright colors, but the mermaid flesh itself was so pale it bordered on white.  The meat went into a bowl with a dollop of mayonnaise and minced onion. They blended together into a sea of white. An unappealing sight that made me long for the days when I still had tuna.  The store only had white bread, so I smeared the paste on a doughy slice. I covered it with a second slice, and then it disappeared into my well-used lunchbag with a couple crab apples from the tree outside.  I had seen documentaries about mermaids while staying up into the late hours of the night. They seemed so romantic in the cartoons of my childhood, with their human charm. But the mermaids that dominated the oceans were vacant-eyed and listless, more like any other fish than the singing princesses of my childhood.  It was a bit sad to see how I'd been duped into a humanistic majesty that never existed, but it did make the canned mermaid easier to swallow.  The can disappeared into the recycling bin, the cartoon mermaid's smile almost sarcastic in its cheeriness. Mermaids were still plentiful in the ocean, but I wondered how long they would continue to thrive. My childhood cartoons also neglected to capture all the variances of human nature.  How many of us consumed and consumed, leaving only extinction and adorable cans in our wake? And it was so easy to consume when working seventy hours a week gave me time for nothing else.  I left my little apartment for the flooded streets below, like a mermaid of the city as I carried my lunchbag in one hand.  Today is a short one, but I wanted to write something about a monster that thrives in the dark. Be forewarned for some sexual content.  Hands like shadows wandered over Amihan's dark, tattoo-littered skin. They teased at the lines of black and red and violet, the shaded pomegranates and bones. The hallway was so dark that she couldn't tell if her eyes were even open. All she could do was lean forward and brace herself against the brick wall.  One hand slipped under her pleather skirt, and the wispy fingers tugged at her scant panties. More hands ventured beneath her ratty shirt. Her nipples were hard beneath the chilled touches of the fingers, the small of her back yielding to one wide palm.  Amihan's painted lips parted as a surprised gasp left her, and two fingers intruded upon the heat of her wet mouth. She didn't know what these creatures exploring her body looked like--maybe they were indistinguishable from the darkness itself.  Fingers slid past her panties, and she whined as the chill of those creatures breached the intimate folds of her sex.  The cold of the hallway couldn't touch her then, not as the fingers labored over the fire growing within her.  I wrote a tiny piece about zombies today. Be warned for gore and death that's typical of zombie settings.  The embalmer's head fell back, and the gash along his throat spread into a visceral grin. Maggots glistened among the rotting flesh like a set of teeth. Not everyone could host the maggots as they developed into adults, and the embalmer was one such case. Despite this the repulsive creatures would still tried to take control of his corpse. They wriggled deeper and deeper into this flesh.  Kayde watched as the corpse's hands twitched ineffectually. The insects couldn't force the embalmer to do anything more substantial. ""Think we should burn the body anyway?"" Luanne asked, her southern drawl muffled by the hazmat suit. ""Don't think he's going anywhere, but can't be too sure.""  ""We don't have that much gas left,"" Kayde responded. ""Let's just leave him. If they're infecting him they're not infecting anyone they can actually move.""  Luanne hummed to herself. ""Is that how it works?"" she asked, and she prodded the corpse with a broom handle. The embalmer's abdomen was swollen and straining against the buttons of his ruined shirt.  Kayde turned from the body and shifted the duffel bag slung over his shoulder. ""Stop that,"" he chided. ""The last thing we need is that shit exploding on us."" Even if the embalmer couldn't move there were plenty of corpses that could move lurking throughout the neighborhood, shambling around at the behest of the insects burrowed in their decomposing flesh.  And Kayde didn't want the swarmed to be alerted to their presence when the emtvrbalmer burst. One corpse might be harmless, but a swarm could overpower them--could tear away their hazmat suits and vomit clusters of translucent eggs down their throats.  Luanne whined her protest, but she dropped the broom handle. Unlike Kayde, she derived a macabre pleasure from the death and decay that now defined their world. Her delight made his stomach roll with nausea.  ""Don't be gross,"" Kayde rebuked, and he walked away.  I didn't have much an idea for today, so it's something really short today. Nothing really needing a warning, unless zombies are an issue.  The farther he descended into the waters the deeper the chill permeated his flesh. All the while the shark's rough scales brushed against him. It was too dark to see the predator, but he could imagine its rotted face--its empty eye sockets and cartilage poking forth from the decay.  Curiosity had its price, and his body would be offered up to pay that debt. The shark would make certain of that.  Man, I don't even know what to say about this one. Warnings for some language that verges in self-harm ideation, I guess. And unreality.   ""I need to speak to you.""   I found those five words scrawled over and over throughout my apartment. Upon the aging fridge and cupboards, scrawling along the hallway walls, upon the bedroom ceiling. All in the same garish red, the same looping letters.    ""I need to speak to you.""   The windows were sealed shut, and the door immobile upon it's hinges. I was a prisoner in a house without an exit, no matter how hard I pounded on the window-glass and hammered at the door.    ""I need to speak with you.""   The specter repeated those words like a mantra. I wondered if those words were even carved into my bones. If I peeled away my skin and muscles would that same distinct writing be there, etched down into the marrow?    ""I need to speak with you.""   I ate the remaining saltines in the cupboards and I drank tap water straight from the faucet. I reread the same books about burning farms and young girls running through swirling ash. I scribbled out the reappearing red requests with the stubs of crayons.    ""I need to speak with you.""   The words appeared the most at sunset, when the sky outside was an inferno and the clouds were thick tendrils of smoke. Every demand I crossed out was replaced by a new one.    ""I need to speak with you.""   When I ran out of crayons I broke the lightbulbs. I retreated to a darkness where the words could not touch me. If the words cut through that darkness--if they started to glow like the sunset or the burning fires or my ghastly white bones--then I would gouge out my eyes.    ""I need to speak with you.""   Those words would have to be written on my empty sockets, into the tender flesh that once cradled my eyes.    ""I need to speak with you.""   My house smelled of ash, and I could imagine the hands behind those words having that same scent. Fingers that spoke a language of destruction, even when writing five otherwise innocuous words.  ""I need to speak with you.""  Look, I was gonna use this prompt to write about Jude and the Fairy. Of course I was.  As far as warnings go there's some light sexual content here.  Jude's hand smoothed over the Fairy's calf as his lips settled upon her knobbly knee. The bedroom smelled of nail polish, and the bottle was forgotten by Jude's crouched form. The Fairy's nails were like opals in the incandescent light, immaculate in contrast to the black paint chipping on Jude's own fingernails.  The Fairy raised her hands high above her head, and she marveled at the ethereal rainbow contained within that nail polish. She sat upon the bed, like a ghost against the dark blankets. ""Pretty,"" she breathed. Her white pupils were invisible among the milky sea of her eyes, but Jude could still tell how focused they were on the paint.  She'd always been fascinated by his own painted nails. Supposedly the fairies had no cosmetics of their own, only gauzy white garments and strands of teeth to adorn their colorless bodies, so the world of makeup was a constant mystery to the Fairy.  ""I thought you'd like that one,"" Jude murmured. The nail polishes he wore were all dark and simple colors--black, dark blue, khaki green, and royal purple--so he'd purchased that shade just for her.  He wondered what else she would like. Would she enjoy eyeshadow that shimmered like the sea? How would she feel about lipstick, with even the palest colors vibrant against her tooth-white skin?  His hand ventured down her calf and cradled her pronounced ankle. Jude was mindful of her drying toenails as he handled her tiny foot.  The Fairy looked back down at Jude. Her still-damp hair hung in long tendrils, unlike the curls that never left Jude's own tousled mane. The heat of the bath might have long left them, but Jude could feel a new warmth spread across his chest and face as he kissed the Fairy's knee again before moving his lips to the soft flesh of her thigh.  The smallest of smiles graced the Fairy as she spread her legs. The lips of her sex were an endearing sight, and the slick opening nestled between them made Jude's mouth water, just as it always did.  ""You're always so good to me,"" the Fairy said, voice like an ethereal melody. She always sounded like the wind and spring rain somehow condensed into a single being. Jude kissed her thigh again and again, creeping ever closer to her delicate pussy.  ""I love you,"" he murmured, and he could hear her soft laugh in response.  ""And I love you,"" the Fairy replied, and her eyes slipped shut as Jude's mouth descended upon those inviting folds. Her hands splayed upon the flannel blanket as she minded the painted nails.  I didn't have much of a plan for this one. I just remembered a time when some clouds in the sky looked like a castle.  No real warnings for this one.   Offer three bundles of black grapes and a moonstone bathed into storm water to the maiden of the Loess Cliffs. Kneel before the statue, clap three times, and then the Lord's castle will appear.   The dewy blades of grass clung to Sienna's bare legs as she looked up at the weather-worn statue. She clapped her callused hands--once, twice, thrice--and closed her eyes. The statue's passive face was immobile as always. It looked to the night sky, at the stars as pale as its granite surface.  Knobbly hands like dark clouds descended from the sky, like the seeking grasp of an unnamed god. And then it appeared between those fingers.  The silhouette of a castle, darker than the indigo sky itself. Windows like starlight, the entire majesty hanging upside-down between those hands.  Sienna disappeared then. The hands spirited her away to the phantom in the sky, with the statue's stoic gaze revealing nothing.  I guess I need to warn for some light body horror with this one. Or maybe it's not light at all, maybe it's pure body horror.  Oh well. be cautious of body parts doing what body parts should not be doing.  I could hear the call of the sirens, the song like a drone burrowing into the whorls of my brain. The stories of their song being an achingly beautiful melody was a myth, a fiction to obscure the truth of those repulsive creatures that lined the beach.  They stared at my lit windows with their sunken, storm-gray eyes, teeth stained with old blood as they serenaded me. Their voices were foghorns over the crashing waves as they sang their complex words, all from a language older than the ocean itself.  The music made my head pound, as though my brain itself was hammering against my confining skull. I wanted to take a chisel to my forehead to chip the bone away and free my brain from its prison. I wondered how it would look--how the call of the sirens reshaped the tender gray curls.  Would I hear their same song come from deep within my brain, that same eerie foghorn bellowing over the ocean waves?  I'm here, I'm here. Sorry, I was distracted today. Guess be mindful of unreality today, and maybe some light body horror.  Her smile widened, her blue-white teeth large in her mouth. I always tried to count her teeth--she always seemed to have too many--but time and time again I lost count. ""We missed you at the meeting,"" she said, her thin lips nearly invisible as they stretched to reveal those teeth. ""Were you feeling sick again?""  ""Oh. Uh, yeah,"" I answered, and I wished she would leave already. I'd had worse neighbors in my life, but her persistence had a way of burrowing under my skin. Plus, she had ulterior motives.  Her face contorted into a mockery of sympathy. ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,"" she cooed. The wind tugged at the bleached wisps of her hair, pulling them free from her immaculately styled bob. ""Maybe next time then? There's been concerns about the disappearances in our community, and I think your involvement would be so helpful.""  Her mouth closed and I lost count of those teeth. I think I'd counted thirty along that top row, but I was no longer sure. ""Oh, the dog attacks?"" I said as I crouched down to check my little flower box. The pansies looked up at me with their disgruntled faces, all white and yellow and purple. ""You know I don't have any dogs.""  The corner of her mouth twitched. ""Yes, the dog attacks,"" she replied, and for a brief moment she looked irritated. It was the only sincere expression I'd ever seen her make. ""Well, even if you don't have a dog you might have seen something we haven't."" Her smile returned, and I looked at the bottom row of her teeth. The countless teeth, all perfectly straight and brilliant.  ""I doubt it."" I said. ""But I guess I'll let you know if anything comes up.""     She closed her mouth again, and I forgot how many teeth I'd counted, just as I always did.  Today sucks, here's a quick bit of undead wraith porn.  Elijah braced himself against the crumbling wall as the wraith's knobbly hand lifted his leg higher and higher, spreading Elijah so wide that his hips protested the stretch. Elijah would have toppled over if not for the mausoleum.   The wraith's cock protruded from layers of their white robe, the fabric gauzy and rotted from time. Even the rush of arousal brought warmth to the creature's gray skin. Elijah's eyes still fluttered shut though as the head breached the folds of his pussy. ""Yeah, like that,"" he breathed even though he knew the wraith wouldn't answer him.   The wraith's dirty nails instead dug into the ample flesh of his thigh as they pressed the entirety of their cock into Elijah. They moved slowly, as though the rapid thrusts that Elijah was so used to would destroy the wraith's fragile body.   And so the creature fucked Elijah slowly and tenderly.  I wanted to write Beelzebub porn, and so I wrote Beelzebub porn. I also threw in some fun painplay and also probably some light blasphemy.  The angel tilted their head back as a shaky gasp left them, a sound that reverberated off the high ceilings of the throne room. They were a scrap of divinity--barely more holy than the humans that reigned over the earth with their chaotic impulses.  Beelzebub dragged one of his long, spindly claws across the angel's chest. The glowing skin split, and golden ichor welled up within the wound. It spilled in rivulets over the angel's soft belly and over the triangle of their pubic mound. The angel made a pained sound, but their expression only spoke of euphoria. They were in the throes of ecstasy, as though they were communing with their God and not the Lord of the Flies.  Beelzebub's chitinous fingers combed through the angel's ashen hair. He had multiple consorts. Humans as dark as the night sky, humans with hair the red-orange of roaring wildfire. Artists with paint-stained fingers and farmers tanned from a life under the sun. Muscular men and fat women and sharp-boned androgynes. The devout and the cynical. The passionate and the apathetic.  They embodied the plethora of human experiences, his beloved consorts. The angel was different though; they were the first divine creature to share his bed.  The angel's fingers slipped free from their anus. The hole twitched, glistening and pleading for Beelzebub's cock. The angel didn't say anything, just as they never did. Their words were a secret that even Beelzebub couldn't unravel.  He took his cock in his hand, the entire length a disconcerting amalgamation of red and pink swirls. The head pressed against that waiting anus, forcing its way into the angel's body. A sob left the angel as the cock stretched them beyond their limits. Beelzebub was so large, and the angel was so small.  His red compound eyes drank in the sight of the angel in that state of both ecstasy and anguish, and all the while the heat that sheathed his cock burned. It was holy fire, and his demon blood shrieked within its vicinity. The pain was bliss for him in the way it was bliss for the angel. They were two masochists seeking each other out for more glorious pain and suffering.  Beelzebub's claws tore at the angel's fleshy hips as he began to fuck him. His lovely new consort moaned their satisfaction, ethereal as they bounced upon the demon's cock.  A prompt is a prompt, and I've written something. No major warnings, it's just a scrap of an idea.  Hands beneath the river, formed of mud and fish bones and rusted cans.     They grabbed at my legs and pulled me under.     Brown water filled my lungs as I slipped further and further into that polluted kingdom.  No real warnings again, save for a creepy garden gnome. I really, really, REALLY didn't know what to do with this one.  I hated that garden gnome. It's yellow shirt was bleached white by the sun, and the paint was flaking off in large chunks. At one point it might have been smiling, but nature had destroyed its face. An eroded chasm existed now dominated its head. It was an eyesore among the roses and marigolds and the tiny vegetable patch, but my mother was attached to the little monstrosity. A gift from her father when he was still alive, she said.  I looked out the kitchen window and to the garden gnome. A tiny wren clambered into the gnome, and like every other creature that dared to explore that abyss I knew it wouldn't reappear. The tomatoes were beautifully red, and the peppers blended into the plants' lush greenery.  My mother was at the table, cup of coffee between her brittle hands. Her smile widened after the wren vanished. And then she took another sip of her drink.  I burned my hand today, so I didn't really want to write, and I couldn't really get into writing monster plant porn even though that's a brand of horny I really like.  But there is some smut here, so it's okay.  Adalia sighed--oh that beautiful sigh--as she sank down upon those green tendrils unfurling from the vine. She was alone in her boudoir, with the plant basking before the large window as her only companion.  Her preferred companion, if she was honest. The men that vied for her attention were obnoxious in their confidence, in how they talked at her without so much as pausing to let her respond.  The tendrils slipped past her folds and into her waiting body. They explored her sex gingerly, with a gentleness she received from no one else.  Her breasts spilled over her brocade corset. Adalia's nipples were as rosy as the blooms that covered her lover. She wanted to curl up within one of those flowers, safe and distanced from the world she increasingly despised.  The tendrils then began to thrust into Adalia, and she soon devolved into a series of gasps and squeals.  I'm honestly surprised I've made it so far with this set of prompts, even though it's because a lot of them have been exceptionally short. It's still nice to see.  Sexual content is ahead, but it's nothing major.  They lived alone in the ruins of the workshop. Their creator had died years ago--heart having ruptured within his frail body--and so they'd took over the work he'd started.  Neither Mercury nor Jupiter had their creator's talent though. Every doll they made never became more than a collection of joints and limbs and blank glass eyes. Life never crystallized within their creations in the way that it had manifested within themselves.  And so they became accustomed to their seclusion. No siblings would ever join them within the decaying laboratory. Mercury and Jupiter only had each other.  Mercury shivered as he laid upon the workshop table, legs spread to display the lovingly carved curves and folds of his sex. Their lovemaking was a hollow imitation of humanity's, less performed out of desire and more out of habit. Their creator had loved being sandwiched between Mercury and Jupiter as he'd taken from their bodies.  Jupiter's cock slipped inside Mercury, and the two dolls entwined their limbs around each other as they fucked on that workshop table where the bodies of their failed siblings had once lain. The room was bleak with it's water-stained ceiling and moldy walls, but neither doll took note of the decay.  I already kind of had a story with about angels, but that was for another prompt. This one is fine, it's a good chunk of body horror, because my favorite type of angels are the surreal body horror type.  Claws like needles of light punctured my flesh, and I smelled the faint scent of cooking meat. The angels of my mother's ceramic collection--delicate figures with wide eyes and white wings--were nowhere to be seen in this deplorable kingdom of heaven.  They stared at me with their infinite eyes as they sang in voices like the chimes of church bells. The claws left my skin. Blood welled up from the countless wounds, as though to herald the glassy eyes that then emerged from the gore. They gazed both everywhere and nowhere, the dark pupils framed by eerily pale blue.  A mosaic of mouths curved into appreciative smiles as my body transformed into the monstrous divine. ""Holy, holy, holy,"" they sang.  I'm emotionally fried, and I don't have much to say about today's prompt. It probably deserves more attention than I gave it. Oh well.  No warnings for this one.  I laid my small hands upon the wall, and I could feel the hum. The swarms moved beneath the layers of insulation and drywall and velvet-flocked wallpaper. The vibrations were a chorus, each of those small creatures speaking in unison.  My hands spasmed in pain, so I clenched and reopened them until the tendons resettled. The hum always sank into my flesh until my bones themselves were rattling. I hated the sound, just as I hated the decay of the apartment.  But the rent was cheap.  I didn't really know what to do with this, so I brought back Raoul and the King for the occasion. No real warnings here, which is surprising given uh, the dynamic between these two.  Raoul ran his hands over the cool gold bars of his cage. The king was sleeping, as large as a mountain upon his bed. Sometimes the giant would sleep the days away, as though he couldn't bear the sight of his ruined kingdom. He was, after all, alone save for the farmer he kept imprisoned like a song bird.  Even the embers within the fireplace had long since died. The winter chill seeped into the bedchamber without the fire to keep it at bay. Raoul stepped away from the bars, and he crawled back under the blankets and pelts upon his bed. The giant saw Raoul as little more than a toy to humor him during his lonely days, but at least he kept Raoul well-fed and warm.  He buried his face between one of the blankets and blocked out the sight of the cavernous room. He could hear the king's snores. The sound made the entire bedchamber vibrate, and Raoul let the noise enshroud him just as the pelts and blankets did.  It's sex today. Beasts get to be horny too.  The Beast of the Smaragdos Wilds was described as a patchwork quilt of various animals. The wings of a raven and the paws of a bear. The sleek musculature of a cougar and the muzzle of a wolf. And red, red fur--brilliant like a fox's.  But no one had ever mentioned the Beast's eyes, how they were like polished obsidian set in that monstrous skull.  Amber saw those eyes time and time again. They were beautiful, just as the rest of the Beast was beautiful.  How could she have ever resisted the Beast's embrace?  The creature was sprawled out within its den, eyes appraising Amber with that mysterious gaze as she ran her hands through its thick fur. Fingers ventured between the Beast's legs, and they eventually found the long slit of its pussy. Amber's mouth watered at the sight.  How could she have ever resisted bringing her lips to the Beast's sex and tasted the heat that no other human did?She teased at the delicate folds that framed that opening, and her tongue plunged into the Beast. A rumble left the creature--a content sound that Amber basked in. The fur tickled her face, but she ignored the sensation. Only that pussy mattered to her.  The Beast of the Smaragdos Wilds devoured all humans that ventured into its domain, but in the cavern it was instead the prey. And Amber feasted upon the Beast.  I'm close to done. I wish I'd had more time to invest in this, but the prompts have been fun. No warnings for this one either, I guess.  The river was my beloved and my beloved alone. Even as the prairie erupted into an inferno she was there for me, a sanctuary in the midst of the orange flames and pillars of dark smoke. I sank into her embrace as the cries of crows echoed overhead.  The cabin was forsaken, as were the bodies within. My parents had been lost even before the fire consumed their bloated corpses. I'd been abandoned with not even a spare bullet to return me to my family.  Hands emerged from the water and cradled my soot-streaked and charred body. The smoke burned my throat and lungs, but then the river kissed me. Those lips were a balm for my aching body, and I slipped deep into the water.  I'm bringing back Asterion and Bronte for this one because I didn't have any other ideas. Consequently there's some sexual content here. Bronte getting the dick they want.  Bronte knelt before the Minotaur, knees scuffed and streaked with dirt, and their pink tongue flicked out over the broad head of the creature's cock. That arousal was too long and too thick for Bronte to even dream to taking it into their mouth, but they still delighted in lapping at the imposing cock. The taste of salt and skin was addictive, as was the content huffs that left the Minotaur.  Their tongue laved over the pronounced veins and it teased at the slit. How many times had Bronte braced themself against a labyrinth wall and yowled as that cock plunged into them, reshaping their insides until they were cradling the entirety of its weight.  Bronte could spend the rest of their existence worshiping that cock. They reached down and palmed at their own small, soft cock as they continued to kneel down before the Minotaur, lips and tongue unceasing.  A day late, but it's here, and now the challenge has come to a close. No real warnings for this one, except for maybe body horror?  All five bodies were laid to rest in their shallow graves, all in a neat row. A doctor, a set of twins, a taxidermist,  and a camgirl. The freshly disturbed earth was as dark as the sky above. The soil offered a sanctuary from the lit world above, both for the corpses and the worms.  And those worms, so translucent that their delicate organs were visible, burrowed into the bodies offered to them. They feasted upon the decaying flesh, their segmented bodies swelling more and more. Pustules sprouted upon the worms, their skin incapable of obscuring the red growths forming within. They were embryos, the union of the worms and the corpses.  Those embryos would be nourished by the bodies, and soon, when they were large enough to survive on their own, they would burst from the worms. They would escape the dark earth then, with the night sky greeting them as they crawled out to the land above.";;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

It oozed from the cracks, and she felt her anger return as she watched the blood trickle down her arm.  She thought of that man's audacity--of how he brought his club down upon her fragile body--and the contempt that sloshed within Ilona's body almost made her crawl back out of that casket. Almost made her return to the streets with her broken body, all to find the man that nearly destroyed her and tear out his throat. Her body might be damaged, but her teeth were still wondrously sharp. The man's flesh would yield easily to the diamond points.  Ilona didn't leave the safety of the casket though. The dollmaker could only mend so many cracks before she would have to replace parts of Ilona's body entirely, and new limbs took months to acclimate to. She would be even less equipped to take revenge upon the abhorrent man if her arms refused to move.  So she remained in her casket, her sanctuary. Ilona closed her eyes, and she imagined the glass orbs rattling about in her hollow skull.    No.   They were more likely floating in a sea of blood. The dollmaker said she was more ravenous than the previous dolls--her siblings. Ilona couldn't resist the call of the blood though. The dollmaker's own blood might have been too thin and bland to be palatable, but the city was filled with far more delectable people. Ilona particularly savored blood laced with dark wine, with bourbon and vodka and heavy beer.  That was, after all, why she'd initially targeted that man. He was a regular at Loretta's, and she could always smell the beer upon his breath.    Good beer.   How was she supposed to know the drunkard could defend himself?  She rested her hands upon her chest, the lovingly carved fingers growing numb as more blood flowed from her body. Her green dress was probably stained beyond repair.  Ilona vowed to make the man suffer for ruining her dress. Perhaps she'd gouge his equally green eyes from his gaunt face before she tore him to shreds. A quick death seemed too merciful.  Her fingers twitched once, twice, and then they stilled.  Second day, second prompt. There's some sexual content here, but nothing major, unless we're considering doppelganger sex to be incest. Then there's incest here, I guess.  The other Ash Holliday slept under the bed. Ash couldn't explain why a doppelganger of themself existed, nor could they answer why the creature was most comfortable on the cold floor, curled up beside Ash's collection of colorful sneakers. They could only shrug and accept the doppelganger's existence as a truth without explanation.  Ash opened their eyes as they felt the touch of cool, chubby hands upon their face. They weren't sleeping--not really. The doppelganger always left its nest at the stroke of midnight. The creature crawled onto the bed, and it straddled Ash's hips. It was a being defined by strict routines.  The doppelganger's lips were cold upon Ash's own. It might have been a reflection of Ash's own plain appearance, all unremarkable eyes and lank hair, but it lacked Ash's warmth. The doppelganger had no life pumping through its own veins.  It had to seek Ash for heat.  For life.  A low, content sigh left Ash as the doppelganger's hand slipped beneath the blankets and discovered the plump lips of their sex. ""Incorrigible,"" they murmured, but they still spread their legs to give the doppelganger better access to their pussy.  The doppelganger didn't answer them. It was incapable of speech--the loudest sounds it could muster being nothing more than breathy rasps. Anyone eavesdropping upon the lascivious scene in that bedroom would only ever hear Ash's low moans.  Ash wound their arms around the doppelganger, and the mattress groaned as the two became entangled.  Beneath them, under the mattress, laid the mess of Ash's shoes. A hand mirror, long forgotten by Ash, laid among the heap of bright canvas and dingy shoelaces, the polished surface as chilly as the doppelganger itself.  So, uh. In my defense, I had this written before the Roe v. Wade news last night. The forced pregnancy is coincidental. If that's an issue then give this story a pass.  Other warnings include the implication of past rape and body horror. And centipedes, if that bothers you.  This short piece is a continuation of a story I wrote for the Like It Or Not zine. Johnny just continuing to have a horrible life.  ""That's right, baby,"" Acid purred, hands holding Johnny's thighs spread and ratted hair tickling the back of his captive's neck. ""Just take those deep breaths.""   Johnny didn't respond to the creature. He instead bit back a pained sob as another contraction rolled through his body. He could feel small legs scrape against the delicate flesh of his vagina, and he felt his nausea peak as he saw the soft, translucent body of a plump centipede wriggle itself free from his body.   Their first child, finally hatched from the clutch of eggs nestled within Johnny. A long, segmented body--garishly red and lined with sharp legs--wound around the small centipede. Embracing it.   ""You're doing so good,"" Acid praised, his dark lipstick leaving bruise-like smudges upon Johnny's shoulder. ""I wonder how many we'll have? You're so big, there's got to be at least twenty crawling around in there.""   Another contraction, another agonized whine from Johnny. ""Make it stop,"" he pleaded. His eyes were wet, and the first tear rolled down his cheek as he felt the legs of a second centipede clawing its way out. He never had any desire for human children, let alone for a swarm of centipedes.   But Acid did, and Johnny simply had the misfortune of being the closest womb available.   The second centipede joined its sibling, leaving Johnny to the throes of his labor. Painted, clawed fingernails rubbed his thighs, but the soothing gesture meant nothing as Johnny thought of the ruins of his future.  Today's prompt is about a satyr since I never really wrote anything about satyrs before. The only really warning is that it's sexually explicit, and there's some alcohol involved. The satyr must fuck.  ""Follow the brown butterflies, and you'll meet a satyr.""  He ran his fingers through the curls of the satyr's hair and brushed his fingers against the delicate wings of the butterfly settled upon the creature's crown. Dark wine was sticky and heady upon both their lips. The satyr kissed him and savored that taste.  Grass tickled their flesh as they laid upon the earthen ground. The sun was low in the fire-orange sky, with the dense trees around them growing darker by the minute.  The narrow head of the satyr's cock pressed up against the man's anus, and then it was burrowing deep within him. His drunken gasp was easy, his limbs relaxed as he wound them around the satyr. The butterfly left the satyr's unkempt hair, and it spiraled into the sky.  It disappeared into the vibrant sunset, as though consumed by an inferno.  A breathy laugh left him as he watched the butterfly disappear, only for the delirious sound to transform into a moan. The satyr wasted no time in pounding into him. He felt like a growing wildfire, consuming more and more of the forest around them.  Soon he would join the fiery sunset as his orgasm burned away everything.  I got a bit carried away with this prompt since they're supposed to all be short. I mean, it's still short, but not as short as the others.  Warnings include a lot of violence and gore.  Sweat dripped from Artemis's brow as she scrabbled along the cavern wall.  The hunters had invaded  the den, and the pack was out hunting. She was alone, with the moonlit glow of her skin announcing her exact location. They hunters would find her, and they would slaughter her like a pig. As the superstition went, ""Consume the flesh of a witch cursed by the moon, and no disease will ever take you.""  The Lord Barrone was afraid of disease, justifiably so as more and more pustules sprouted upon his flesh like dandelions. He was dying, and he was desperate. He would do anything to escape his rapidly approaching fate, even if it involved devouring Artemis's cursed flesh.  Artemis shrieked as the hunter's torchlight fell upon her. His voice was loud and booming, and her terror turned his words into an incomprehensible blur. She heard more heavy footsteps. The hunters were gathering to claim their prey.  The men were soon upon her. Gloved hands grabbed her flaxen braids and yanked her arms behind her back. They wound coarse rope around her wrists, and when she screamed her contempt for their profane gods until one of the hunters smacked her. The leather stung, and she could feel an angry heat blossom upon one cheek.  ""Let's get out of here,"" one of the hunters said in a nasal, petulant voice. ""We don't want to be here when those wolves show up.""  ""I'm not afraid of the witch's lapdogs,"" the first of the hunters complained, but he offered no other protests. The men hoisted Artemis to her feet, and they dragged her from the cavern. Her dress was filthy and torn, and they shared cruel jokes among themselves over her unflattering appearance.  She wasn't one of the proper women from the village. She was unkempt and feral, and the curse marked her as incapable of the femininity the hunters hungered for. Artemis hoped their disgust would be a blessing in disguise. She hoped they would be too repulsed to take any pleasure from her, too bury their cocks in her unwilling body.  A wolf howled outside the cavern, and the nasal hunter swore under his breath. ""They're already here,"" he shouted, and Artemis heard the thin whine of anxiety. ""Those worthless scouts!""  ""How are we supposed to get the witch out of here then?"" one of the hunter's companions demanded, but no answer ever arrived. The wolves poured from the trees, as though summoned by Artemis's ethereal glow. They crossed the field with their long, powerful limbs, and then they were upon the cavern.  Upon the hunters.  Blades sliced into the wolves, and rifles fired bullets into their flesh, but they were unrelenting in their assault. Artemis knew the silver had to be a burning agony, but the wolves refused to yield. They tore open throats and pulled limbs from their sockets. The resultant screams were haunting. They were the wails of animals in their death throes.  Blood splattered upon Artemis's face as she fell to the muddy ground. She frantically rubbed the grime from her eyes, and then she looked at the savagery around her. Her heart pounded in her chest. She watched as the largest of the wolves, a graying creature littered with pale scars lifted the nasal hunter from the ground. The contemptible man was praying, the holy words a frantic babble from his bloodied lips.  The wolf snarled. He didn't know the gods of the hunters; the only divinity he knew was the moon-cursed woman on the ground. And so he squeezed the hunter's throat, crushing the man's esophagus and puncturing his arteries with sharpened claws. Blood sprayed from the hunter, and his body spasmed pathetically.  Artemis watched on with wide eyes. The bitter taste of nausea crept up her own throat, and she knew  nightmares of that blood would pursue her for as long as she lived.The wolves tore the rope from her raw wrists after ever hunter laid motionless upon the ground, but she couldn't even muster the words to offer her gratitude.  She could only think of death.  The deaths of the hunters, of the lord wasting away on his throne, and of her own.  One of the wolves leaned in close, and she lapped away the blood upon Artemis's face.  A short one today since my time is limited, but I hope you like creepy forests.  No warnings for this one, just trees.  The forest was dead--had been dead long before my grandfather purchased the land--and the bare trees were like bleached bones underneath the harsh sunlight. I wondered what they used to look like, covered in bark and green with life, but the idea seemed too preposterous. The trees once being anything but dead seemed like an outlandish fantasy.  They were dead, just as they'd always been dead.  The forest felt wrong with its absence of flora and fauna alike. I could walk among the trees in complete silence. No birds, no insects. Not even the howl of a wind. I could hear my blood pumping through my veins in that graveyard of trees,  I had a macabre fondness for that dessicated wilderness, but I only visited the trees during the day. At night the silence of the forest gave way to a sickly groan. The trees would yank themselves from the ground, roots as pale as the dead branches, and they would prowl the land that belonged to my grandfather in name only.  It's about dragons today, and I've decided it's also about extreme gore today. Be a responsible pet owner and feed you dragon.  Dark blood bubbled forth from Briar's chapped lips as he looked up at the dragon. His hands--his painfully small hands--smoothed over the creature's oil-black scales. His nerves were still singing their chorus of agony, but the melody was drawing to a close.    Shock, probably.   His organs were beautifully wet and shiny as they laid upon the ground, gravel clinging to them as the dragon kicked them aside with its powerful legs.  Spasms wracked Briar's narrow frame. His limbs grew weaker and weaker as his blood pooled around him. Briar's eyes felt heavy, like lead weights settled in the sockets of his skull.  The dragon leaned down and buried its muzzle in the fresh cavern of Briar's shredded abdomen. The creature didn't devour Briar, not yet. Dragons preferred to play with their meals before they gave into their hunger.  A wet rasp left Briar, his face blue and gray and wide-eyed. The dragon's scales blurred into one incomprehensible mass, and then--  And then--  The dragon opened its maw, and it began to feed.  I feel a little guilty, not having as long or meaningful stuff as I did for the last Monstrous May. I'm still going to hash out each of these prompts though, because I want to see the challenge to its end.  More violence and gore for this prompt. This May is starting to look less horny and more grisly.  Talons dug into the fat of her arms as the creature descended, all five eyes focused on her face. Her gun--a pretty Derringer with a lovingly engraved handle--fell from her fingers as shock took her. Her brother's corpse laid at her feet, belly already ruptured and skin a kaleidoscope of color.  She detested the idea of his corpse being fed to these disgusting creatures. She had wanted to chase the birds away, had wanted to take her brother and have him cremated instead.  The bird tore at her with its massive beak, taking away chunks of hair and leaving blood gashes instead. She screamed her frustration and pulled away from the creature, but it was relentless in its assault.  She stepped farther and farther from the bird, her brother's corpse forgotten until she stumbled against it, and then she was falling. She hit the ground with the resounding thud. Her breath left her lungs, and she looked around blindly. Her brother's body laid beside her, eyeless sockets oozing their decay.  She wanted to scream, but the bird swooped down upon her, claws taking her own eyes. She would face her death in darkness.  I watched the Trolls movie once because I thought the texture choices in the animation were legitimately fun. Overall I disliked the movie though.  This troll is nothing like those fun and colorful cartoony ones. I'm pretty sure any songs it sings would be about drinking blood from the skulls of humans it tears apart. Anyway, be forewarned for violent sexual assault and death.  The scent of meat boiling within the thick broth wafted through the air, and Daisy's heart pounded erratically in her chest. She could see the flesh of her friends floating to the surface, joined by a swirl of wild onions and dandelion greens.  How she had nearly joined them--and could still join them--until the troll decided her body had better uses. The rough wood of the table scraped at her back as the troll forced her legs apart, revealing her small cock and anus. The troll's eyes were small and entirely black, and Daisy couldn't read the intentions behind its stare. She could only understand the language of its fingers as they pinched at her cock and tugged at her balls.  Daisy pulled at the rope around her wrists, but the knots held. The skin was red and raw around the coarse rope, nearly as vivid as Daisy's dyed hair. She whined pitifully as she slammed her fists back against the table in frustration, but the troll was unphased.  One large finger brushed over her anus, and she felt a resurgence of nausea. The troll was too large and broad in every sense. She would be as torn to shreds as the bodies in the stew if it fucked her.  The troll cared little for her terror, if it cared at all. It forced that single finger into Daisy's unwilling body, and her shriek bounced off the cavern's walls. Her tender insides screamed their agony over the intrusion, and the claw threatened to puncture every spot it touched.  ""Take it out,"" Daisy begged, but the troll only huffed in response. Its cock was a behemoth even when flaccid.  It was no longer soft though.  The cock was swelling with arousal, becoming so engorged that Daisy could feel her own looming death as she gazed upon it. Nothing could prepare her for such girth.Perhaps after the troll killed her she would be tossed in that pot with her friends, her flesh seasoned by the troll's desire.  An impatient snarl left the troll as it forced a second finger into Daisy. It would tear her asunder in order to accommodate its cock.  I'm definitely rushing to force this story through, but also there's not a whole lot to warn for unless some cynicism about climate disaster applies.  I used to make tuna salad sandwiches for lunch, back before they went extinct. Nothing else quite matched the taste, but canned mermaid was close.  I pulled the tab, and the lid of the can peeled away to reveal the flaky meat contained within. The cartoon of the mermaid on the label was all bright colors, but the mermaid flesh itself was so pale it bordered on white.  The meat went into a bowl with a dollop of mayonnaise and minced onion. They blended together into a sea of white. An unappealing sight that made me long for the days when I still had tuna.  The store only had white bread, so I smeared the paste on a doughy slice. I covered it with a second slice, and then it disappeared into my well-used lunchbag with a couple crab apples from the tree outside.  I had seen documentaries about mermaids while staying up into the late hours of the night. They seemed so romantic in the cartoons of my childhood, with their human charm. But the mermaids that dominated the oceans were vacant-eyed and listless, more like any other fish than the singing princesses of my childhood.  It was a bit sad to see how I'd been duped into a humanistic majesty that never existed, but it did make the canned mermaid easier to swallow.  The can disappeared into the recycling bin, the cartoon mermaid's smile almost sarcastic in its cheeriness. Mermaids were still plentiful in the ocean, but I wondered how long they would continue to thrive. My childhood cartoons also neglected to capture all the variances of human nature.  How many of us consumed and consumed, leaving only extinction and adorable cans in our wake? And it was so easy to consume when working seventy hours a week gave me time for nothing else.  I left my little apartment for the flooded streets below, like a mermaid of the city as I carried my lunchbag in one hand.  Today is a short one, but I wanted to write something about a monster that thrives in the dark. Be forewarned for some sexual content.  Hands like shadows wandered over Amihan's dark, tattoo-littered skin. They teased at the lines of black and red and violet, the shaded pomegranates and bones. The hallway was so dark that she couldn't tell if her eyes were even open. All she could do was lean forward and brace herself against the brick wall.  One hand slipped under her pleather skirt, and the wispy fingers tugged at her scant panties. More hands ventured beneath her ratty shirt. Her nipples were hard beneath the chilled touches of the fingers, the small of her back yielding to one wide palm.  Amihan's painted lips parted as a surprised gasp left her, and two fingers intruded upon the heat of her wet mouth. She didn't know what these creatures exploring her body looked like--maybe they were indistinguishable from the darkness itself.  Fingers slid past her panties, and she whined as the chill of those creatures breached the intimate folds of her sex.  The cold of the hallway couldn't touch her then, not as the fingers labored over the fire growing within her.  I wrote a tiny piece about zombies today. Be warned for gore and death that's typical of zombie settings.  The embalmer's head fell back, and the gash along his throat spread into a visceral grin. Maggots glistened among the rotting flesh like a set of teeth. Not everyone could host the maggots as they developed into adults, and the embalmer was one such case. Despite this the repulsive creatures would still tried to take control of his corpse. They wriggled deeper and deeper into this flesh.  Kayde watched as the corpse's hands twitched ineffectually. The insects couldn't force the embalmer to do anything more substantial. ""Think we should burn the body anyway?"" Luanne asked, her southern drawl muffled by the hazmat suit. ""Don't think he's going anywhere, but can't be too sure.""  ""We don't have that much gas left,"" Kayde responded. ""Let's just leave him. If they're infecting him they're not infecting anyone they can actually move.""  Luanne hummed to herself. ""Is that how it works?"" she asked, and she prodded the corpse with a broom handle. The embalmer's abdomen was swollen and straining against the buttons of his ruined shirt.  Kayde turned from the body and shifted the duffel bag slung over his shoulder. ""Stop that,"" he chided. ""The last thing we need is that shit exploding on us."" Even if the embalmer couldn't move there were plenty of corpses that could move lurking throughout the neighborhood, shambling around at the behest of the insects burrowed in their decomposing flesh.  And Kayde didn't want the swarmed to be alerted to their presence when the emtvrbalmer burst. One corpse might be harmless, but a swarm could overpower them--could tear away their hazmat suits and vomit clusters of translucent eggs down their throats.  Luanne whined her protest, but she dropped the broom handle. Unlike Kayde, she derived a macabre pleasure from the death and decay that now defined their world. Her delight made his stomach roll with nausea.  ""Don't be gross,"" Kayde rebuked, and he walked away.  I didn't have much an idea for today, so it's something really short today. Nothing really needing a warning, unless zombies are an issue.  The farther he descended into the waters the deeper the chill permeated his flesh. All the while the shark's rough scales brushed against him. It was too dark to see the predator, but he could imagine its rotted face--its empty eye sockets and cartilage poking forth from the decay.  Curiosity had its price, and his body would be offered up to pay that debt. The shark would make certain of that.  Man, I don't even know what to say about this one. Warnings for some language that verges in self-harm ideation, I guess. And unreality.   ""I need to speak to you.""   I found those five words scrawled over and over throughout my apartment. Upon the aging fridge and cupboards, scrawling along the hallway walls, upon the bedroom ceiling. All in the same garish red, the same looping letters.    ""I need to speak to you.""   The windows were sealed shut, and the door immobile upon it's hinges. I was a prisoner in a house without an exit, no matter how hard I pounded on the window-glass and hammered at the door.    ""I need to speak with you.""   The specter repeated those words like a mantra. I wondered if those words were even carved into my bones. If I peeled away my skin and muscles would that same distinct writing be there, etched down into the marrow?    ""I need to speak with you.""   I ate the remaining saltines in the cupboards and I drank tap water straight from the faucet. I reread the same books about burning farms and young girls running through swirling ash. I scribbled out the reappearing red requests with the stubs of crayons.    ""I need to speak with you.""   The words appeared the most at sunset, when the sky outside was an inferno and the clouds were thick tendrils of smoke. Every demand I crossed out was replaced by a new one.    ""I need to speak with you.""   When I ran out of crayons I broke the lightbulbs. I retreated to a darkness where the words could not touch me. If the words cut through that darkness--if they started to glow like the sunset or the burning fires or my ghastly white bones--then I would gouge out my eyes.    ""I need to speak with you.""   Those words would have to be written on my empty sockets, into the tender flesh that once cradled my eyes.    ""I need to speak with you.""   My house smelled of ash, and I could imagine the hands behind those words having that same scent. Fingers that spoke a language of destruction, even when writing five otherwise innocuous words.  ""I need to speak with you.""  Look, I was gonna use this prompt to write about Jude and the Fairy. Of course I was.  As far as warnings go there's some light sexual content here.  Jude's hand smoothed over the Fairy's calf as his lips settled upon her knobbly knee. The bedroom smelled of nail polish, and the bottle was forgotten by Jude's crouched form. The Fairy's nails were like opals in the incandescent light, immaculate in contrast to the black paint chipping on Jude's own fingernails.  The Fairy raised her hands high above her head, and she marveled at the ethereal rainbow contained within that nail polish. She sat upon the bed, like a ghost against the dark blankets. ""Pretty,"" she breathed. Her white pupils were invisible among the milky sea of her eyes, but Jude could still tell how focused they were on the paint.  She'd always been fascinated by his own painted nails. Supposedly the fairies had no cosmetics of their own, only gauzy white garments and strands of teeth to adorn their colorless bodies, so the world of makeup was a constant mystery to the Fairy.  ""I thought you'd like that one,"" Jude murmured. The nail polishes he wore were all dark and simple colors--black, dark blue, khaki green, and royal purple--so he'd purchased that shade just for her.  He wondered what else she would like. Would she enjoy eyeshadow that shimmered like the sea? How would she feel about lipstick, with even the palest colors vibrant against her tooth-white skin?  His hand ventured down her calf and cradled her pronounced ankle. Jude was mindful of her drying toenails as he handled her tiny foot.  The Fairy looked back down at Jude. Her still-damp hair hung in long tendrils, unlike the curls that never left Jude's own tousled mane. The heat of the bath might have long left them, but Jude could feel a new warmth spread across his chest and face as he kissed the Fairy's knee again before moving his lips to the soft flesh of her thigh.  The smallest of smiles graced the Fairy as she spread her legs. The lips of her sex were an endearing sight, and the slick opening nestled between them made Jude's mouth water, just as it always did.  ""You're always so good to me,"" the Fairy said, voice like an ethereal melody. She always sounded like the wind and spring rain somehow condensed into a single being. Jude kissed her thigh again and again, creeping ever closer to her delicate pussy.  ""I love you,"" he murmured, and he could hear her soft laugh in response.  ""And I love you,"" the Fairy replied, and her eyes slipped shut as Jude's mouth descended upon those inviting folds. Her hands splayed upon the flannel blanket as she minded the painted nails.  I didn't have much of a plan for this one. I just remembered a time when some clouds in the sky looked like a castle.  No real warnings for this one.   Offer three bundles of black grapes and a moonstone bathed into storm water to the maiden of the Loess Cliffs. Kneel before the statue, clap three times, and then the Lord's castle will appear.   The dewy blades of grass clung to Sienna's bare legs as she looked up at the weather-worn statue. She clapped her callused hands--once, twice, thrice--and closed her eyes. The statue's passive face was immobile as always. It looked to the night sky, at the stars as pale as its granite surface.  Knobbly hands like dark clouds descended from the sky, like the seeking grasp of an unnamed god. And then it appeared between those fingers.  The silhouette of a castle, darker than the indigo sky itself. Windows like starlight, the entire majesty hanging upside-down between those hands.  Sienna disappeared then. The hands spirited her away to the phantom in the sky, with the statue's stoic gaze revealing nothing.  I guess I need to warn for some light body horror with this one. Or maybe it's not light at all, maybe it's pure body horror.  Oh well. be cautious of body parts doing what body parts should not be doing.  I could hear the call of the sirens, the song like a drone burrowing into the whorls of my brain. The stories of their song being an achingly beautiful melody was a myth, a fiction to obscure the truth of those repulsive creatures that lined the beach.  They stared at my lit windows with their sunken, storm-gray eyes, teeth stained with old blood as they serenaded me. Their voices were foghorns over the crashing waves as they sang their complex words, all from a language older than the ocean itself.  The music made my head pound, as though my brain itself was hammering against my confining skull. I wanted to take a chisel to my forehead to chip the bone away and free my brain from its prison. I wondered how it would look--how the call of the sirens reshaped the tender gray curls.  Would I hear their same song come from deep within my brain, that same eerie foghorn bellowing over the ocean waves?  I'm here, I'm here. Sorry, I was distracted today. Guess be mindful of unreality today, and maybe some light body horror.  Her smile widened, her blue-white teeth large in her mouth. I always tried to count her teeth--she always seemed to have too many--but time and time again I lost count. ""We missed you at the meeting,"" she said, her thin lips nearly invisible as they stretched to reveal those teeth. ""Were you feeling sick again?""  ""Oh. Uh, yeah,"" I answered, and I wished she would leave already. I'd had worse neighbors in my life, but her persistence had a way of burrowing under my skin. Plus, she had ulterior motives.  Her face contorted into a mockery of sympathy. ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,"" she cooed. The wind tugged at the bleached wisps of her hair, pulling them free from her immaculately styled bob. ""Maybe next time then? There's been concerns about the disappearances in our community, and I think your involvement would be so helpful.""  Her mouth closed and I lost count of those teeth. I think I'd counted thirty along that top row, but I was no longer sure. ""Oh, the dog attacks?"" I said as I crouched down to check my little flower box. The pansies looked up at me with their disgruntled faces, all white and yellow and purple. ""You know I don't have any dogs.""  The corner of her mouth twitched. ""Yes, the dog attacks,"" she replied, and for a brief moment she looked irritated. It was the only sincere expression I'd ever seen her make. ""Well, even if you don't have a dog you might have seen something we haven't."" Her smile returned, and I looked at the bottom row of her teeth. The countless teeth, all perfectly straight and brilliant.  ""I doubt it."" I said. ""But I guess I'll let you know if anything comes up.""     She closed her mouth again, and I forgot how many teeth I'd counted, just as I always did.  Today sucks, here's a quick bit of undead wraith porn.  Elijah braced himself against the crumbling wall as the wraith's knobbly hand lifted his leg higher and higher, spreading Elijah so wide that his hips protested the stretch. Elijah would have toppled over if not for the mausoleum.   The wraith's cock protruded from layers of their white robe, the fabric gauzy and rotted from time. Even the rush of arousal brought warmth to the creature's gray skin. Elijah's eyes still fluttered shut though as the head breached the folds of his pussy. ""Yeah, like that,"" he breathed even though he knew the wraith wouldn't answer him.   The wraith's dirty nails instead dug into the ample flesh of his thigh as they pressed the entirety of their cock into Elijah. They moved slowly, as though the rapid thrusts that Elijah was so used to would destroy the wraith's fragile body.   And so the creature fucked Elijah slowly and tenderly.  I wanted to write Beelzebub porn, and so I wrote Beelzebub porn. I also threw in some fun painplay and also probably some light blasphemy.  The angel tilted their head back as a shaky gasp left them, a sound that reverberated off the high ceilings of the throne room. They were a scrap of divinity--barely more holy than the humans that reigned over the earth with their chaotic impulses.  Beelzebub dragged one of his long, spindly claws across the angel's chest. The glowing skin split, and golden ichor welled up within the wound. It spilled in rivulets over the angel's soft belly and over the triangle of their pubic mound. The angel made a pained sound, but their expression only spoke of euphoria. They were in the throes of ecstasy, as though they were communing with their God and not the Lord of the Flies.  Beelzebub's chitinous fingers combed through the angel's ashen hair. He had multiple consorts. Humans as dark as the night sky, humans with hair the red-orange of roaring wildfire. Artists with paint-stained fingers and farmers tanned from a life under the sun. Muscular men and fat women and sharp-boned androgynes. The devout and the cynical. The passionate and the apathetic.  They embodied the plethora of human experiences, his beloved consorts. The angel was different though; they were the first divine creature to share his bed.  The angel's fingers slipped free from their anus. The hole twitched, glistening and pleading for Beelzebub's cock. The angel didn't say anything, just as they never did. Their words were a secret that even Beelzebub couldn't unravel.  He took his cock in his hand, the entire length a disconcerting amalgamation of red and pink swirls. The head pressed against that waiting anus, forcing its way into the angel's body. A sob left the angel as the cock stretched them beyond their limits. Beelzebub was so large, and the angel was so small.  His red compound eyes drank in the sight of the angel in that state of both ecstasy and anguish, and all the while the heat that sheathed his cock burned. It was holy fire, and his demon blood shrieked within its vicinity. The pain was bliss for him in the way it was bliss for the angel. They were two masochists seeking each other out for more glorious pain and suffering.  Beelzebub's claws tore at the angel's fleshy hips as he began to fuck him. His lovely new consort moaned their satisfaction, ethereal as they bounced upon the demon's cock.  A prompt is a prompt, and I've written something. No major warnings, it's just a scrap of an idea.  Hands beneath the river, formed of mud and fish bones and rusted cans.     They grabbed at my legs and pulled me under.     Brown water filled my lungs as I slipped further and further into that polluted kingdom.  No real warnings again, save for a creepy garden gnome. I really, really, REALLY didn't know what to do with this one.  I hated that garden gnome. It's yellow shirt was bleached white by the sun, and the paint was flaking off in large chunks. At one point it might have been smiling, but nature had destroyed its face. An eroded chasm existed now dominated its head. It was an eyesore among the roses and marigolds and the tiny vegetable patch, but my mother was attached to the little monstrosity. A gift from her father when he was still alive, she said.  I looked out the kitchen window and to the garden gnome. A tiny wren clambered into the gnome, and like every other creature that dared to explore that abyss I knew it wouldn't reappear. The tomatoes were beautifully red, and the peppers blended into the plants' lush greenery.  My mother was at the table, cup of coffee between her brittle hands. Her smile widened after the wren vanished. And then she took another sip of her drink.  I burned my hand today, so I didn't really want to write, and I couldn't really get into writing monster plant porn even though that's a brand of horny I really like.  But there is some smut here, so it's okay.  Adalia sighed--oh that beautiful sigh--as she sank down upon those green tendrils unfurling from the vine. She was alone in her boudoir, with the plant basking before the large window as her only companion.  Her preferred companion, if she was honest. The men that vied for her attention were obnoxious in their confidence, in how they talked at her without so much as pausing to let her respond.  The tendrils slipped past her folds and into her waiting body. They explored her sex gingerly, with a gentleness she received from no one else.  Her breasts spilled over her brocade corset. Adalia's nipples were as rosy as the blooms that covered her lover. She wanted to curl up within one of those flowers, safe and distanced from the world she increasingly despised.  The tendrils then began to thrust into Adalia, and she soon devolved into a series of gasps and squeals.  I'm honestly surprised I've made it so far with this set of prompts, even though it's because a lot of them have been exceptionally short. It's still nice to see.  Sexual content is ahead, but it's nothing major.  They lived alone in the ruins of the workshop. Their creator had died years ago--heart having ruptured within his frail body--and so they'd took over the work he'd started.  Neither Mercury nor Jupiter had their creator's talent though. Every doll they made never became more than a collection of joints and limbs and blank glass eyes. Life never crystallized within their creations in the way that it had manifested within themselves.  And so they became accustomed to their seclusion. No siblings would ever join them within the decaying laboratory. Mercury and Jupiter only had each other.  Mercury shivered as he laid upon the workshop table, legs spread to display the lovingly carved curves and folds of his sex. Their lovemaking was a hollow imitation of humanity's, less performed out of desire and more out of habit. Their creator had loved being sandwiched between Mercury and Jupiter as he'd taken from their bodies.  Jupiter's cock slipped inside Mercury, and the two dolls entwined their limbs around each other as they fucked on that workshop table where the bodies of their failed siblings had once lain. The room was bleak with it's water-stained ceiling and moldy walls, but neither doll took note of the decay.  I already kind of had a story with about angels, but that was for another prompt. This one is fine, it's a good chunk of body horror, because my favorite type of angels are the surreal body horror type.  Claws like needles of light punctured my flesh, and I smelled the faint scent of cooking meat. The angels of my mother's ceramic collection--delicate figures with wide eyes and white wings--were nowhere to be seen in this deplorable kingdom of heaven.  They stared at me with their infinite eyes as they sang in voices like the chimes of church bells. The claws left my skin. Blood welled up from the countless wounds, as though to herald the glassy eyes that then emerged from the gore. They gazed both everywhere and nowhere, the dark pupils framed by eerily pale blue.  A mosaic of mouths curved into appreciative smiles as my body transformed into the monstrous divine. ""Holy, holy, holy,"" they sang.  I'm emotionally fried, and I don't have much to say about today's prompt. It probably deserves more attention than I gave it. Oh well.  No warnings for this one.  I laid my small hands upon the wall, and I could feel the hum. The swarms moved beneath the layers of insulation and drywall and velvet-flocked wallpaper. The vibrations were a chorus, each of those small creatures speaking in unison.  My hands spasmed in pain, so I clenched and reopened them until the tendons resettled. The hum always sank into my flesh until my bones themselves were rattling. I hated the sound, just as I hated the decay of the apartment.  But the rent was cheap.  I didn't really know what to do with this, so I brought back Raoul and the King for the occasion. No real warnings here, which is surprising given uh, the dynamic between these two.  Raoul ran his hands over the cool gold bars of his cage. The king was sleeping, as large as a mountain upon his bed. Sometimes the giant would sleep the days away, as though he couldn't bear the sight of his ruined kingdom. He was, after all, alone save for the farmer he kept imprisoned like a song bird.  Even the embers within the fireplace had long since died. The winter chill seeped into the bedchamber without the fire to keep it at bay. Raoul stepped away from the bars, and he crawled back under the blankets and pelts upon his bed. The giant saw Raoul as little more than a toy to humor him during his lonely days, but at least he kept Raoul well-fed and warm.  He buried his face between one of the blankets and blocked out the sight of the cavernous room. He could hear the king's snores. The sound made the entire bedchamber vibrate, and Raoul let the noise enshroud him just as the pelts and blankets did.  It's sex today. Beasts get to be horny too.  The Beast of the Smaragdos Wilds was described as a patchwork quilt of various animals. The wings of a raven and the paws of a bear. The sleek musculature of a cougar and the muzzle of a wolf. And red, red fur--brilliant like a fox's.  But no one had ever mentioned the Beast's eyes, how they were like polished obsidian set in that monstrous skull.  Amber saw those eyes time and time again. They were beautiful, just as the rest of the Beast was beautiful.  How could she have ever resisted the Beast's embrace?  The creature was sprawled out within its den, eyes appraising Amber with that mysterious gaze as she ran her hands through its thick fur. Fingers ventured between the Beast's legs, and they eventually found the long slit of its pussy. Amber's mouth watered at the sight.  How could she have ever resisted bringing her lips to the Beast's sex and tasted the heat that no other human did?She teased at the delicate folds that framed that opening, and her tongue plunged into the Beast. A rumble left the creature--a content sound that Amber basked in. The fur tickled her face, but she ignored the sensation. Only that pussy mattered to her.  The Beast of the Smaragdos Wilds devoured all humans that ventured into its domain, but in the cavern it was instead the prey. And Amber feasted upon the Beast.  I'm close to done. I wish I'd had more time to invest in this, but the prompts have been fun. No warnings for this one either, I guess.  The river was my beloved and my beloved alone. Even as the prairie erupted into an inferno she was there for me, a sanctuary in the midst of the orange flames and pillars of dark smoke. I sank into her embrace as the cries of crows echoed overhead.  The cabin was forsaken, as were the bodies within. My parents had been lost even before the fire consumed their bloated corpses. I'd been abandoned with not even a spare bullet to return me to my family.  Hands emerged from the water and cradled my soot-streaked and charred body. The smoke burned my throat and lungs, but then the river kissed me. Those lips were a balm for my aching body, and I slipped deep into the water.  I'm bringing back Asterion and Bronte for this one because I didn't have any other ideas. Consequently there's some sexual content here. Bronte getting the dick they want.  Bronte knelt before the Minotaur, knees scuffed and streaked with dirt, and their pink tongue flicked out over the broad head of the creature's cock. That arousal was too long and too thick for Bronte to even dream to taking it into their mouth, but they still delighted in lapping at the imposing cock. The taste of salt and skin was addictive, as was the content huffs that left the Minotaur.  Their tongue laved over the pronounced veins and it teased at the slit. How many times had Bronte braced themself against a labyrinth wall and yowled as that cock plunged into them, reshaping their insides until they were cradling the entirety of its weight.  Bronte could spend the rest of their existence worshiping that cock. They reached down and palmed at their own small, soft cock as they continued to kneel down before the Minotaur, lips and tongue unceasing.  A day late, but it's here, and now the challenge has come to a close. No real warnings for this one, except for maybe body horror?  All five bodies were laid to rest in their shallow graves, all in a neat row. A doctor, a set of twins, a taxidermist,  and a camgirl. The freshly disturbed earth was as dark as the sky above. The soil offered a sanctuary from the lit world above, both for the corpses and the worms.  And those worms, so translucent that their delicate organs were visible, burrowed into the bodies offered to them. They feasted upon the decaying flesh, their segmented bodies swelling more and more. Pustules sprouted upon the worms, their skin incapable of obscuring the red growths forming within. They were embryos, the union of the worms and the corpses.  Those embryos would be nourished by the bodies, and soon, when they were large enough to survive on their own, they would burst from the worms. They would escape the dark earth then, with the night sky greeting them as they crawled out to the land above.";;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

The bronzed chestplate hangs on me awkwardly, and it felt as if my limbs were not mine, replaced with a stranger's. I did not feel like a brave warrior, only a foolish child.   ""I feel like Daphne."" I joked, reminded of the stories about the Sun, his lover, and a tree, ones that we have heard since infancy. He would have smiled when we were younger and carefree, without his death weighing on both of us. He did not smile now.   ""Remember, do not fight, stay on the chariot with Automedon."" He instructed me over and over again, fastening the straps of the chestplate and shin guards, fingers fumbling as if this was the first time he had done this. It was not the first, I recalled. We fought together in the first siege of Troy, and he did my amour like he did now. Yet things did not feel the same. Perhaps it was because we would not be together, separated from one while the other wondered what had happened. It would be his turn to worry. I have worried since I learnt of his unavoidable death, and I could not help but be transported to a time where things were different.      When I had laid my eyes on him for the first time, I had hated him with an intensity. He was everything I was not--strong, graceful, heels flashing across the racetrack as if he was blessed with Hermes himself. ""This is what a perfect son should be"" My father had told me, during the races.      Then I was exiled, sent to Pythia as a foster son. There he sat, languidly, uncaring. I remembered disliking him, scorning him out of jealousy, or perhaps spite? It does not matter now. He chose me for a therapon, his closest companion. And I would be his closest companion, I would never leave him, I would follow him wherever he went, even to Pelion. Pelion, where we had made so many memories. Hunting during the summer, patching up each other's wounds, waiting for snow, cleaning in the river, gazing at the stars, listening to the stories of the gods. Even if we had to go through the twelve labors of Heracles on Mount Pelion, I did not care. As long as he was by my side, it would be a treasured memory. Ones that we could not make more of.   I had found a home in his heart right from the start, and he did in mine, as well.     He had already put his helmet on me, the red horsehair clashing against the gold, a loud symbol that would haunt the dreams of the Trojans.   ""Do not fight, stay close to Automedon."" He looked at me closely, checking for any signs that could give me away. ""I know."" I was impatient. I could not afford to be late, I had to save his reputation, so his memory would live on, and the stories told of him would be of glory and fame. I hoped that they would tell one of his musical skills, of how his green eyes reflected happiness when he smiled, how his warm embrace felt.   ""Swear it."" ""I swear it."" It felt like it has been too long since these words rolled off our tongues last, tasting of the mountain air and each other.  He hesitated, and opened the flap of our tent. Automedon stood outside, spears in hand. ""You must bring him back to me."" ""I promise, Lord Pelides."" Achilles' hand found mine, and he gripped it, afraid to let me go. Do not worry, I thought. I will return, like you have all these years. ""Achilles."" I freed my hand from his grasp at last, and turned to him, as a goodbye. I did not say anything else. The sweet declarations of love could wait after I had returned. ""Patroclus."" My name caught in his throat. It sounded like Elysium in my ears, sweeter than any fig I had ever eaten.     We rode to the walls of Troy, and the Greeks recognised the helmet instantly. A cry shouted, and suddenly they fought with newfound vigor. Was this how Achilles felt? I brandished his spear in my own hand and we rode on, making sure Greeks and Trojans alike saw the mighty Achilles. I forgot when, but I stopped Automedon, and started to fight. I do not remember how many I killed, but there was the son of Zeus, Sarpedon himself. Achilles' armor had lent my strength and power, he was with me, always. I could stop this war myself, pluck Helen from the safely guarded Troy and return her to her cuckold husband. Then Achilles and Hector would not have to die. It was a plan of idiocy, and Apollo himself warned me. I tried scaling the walls of Troy again, but I fell. I did not die from the fall, in some twisted plan of the Fates.   Hector himself loomed over me, his spear in hand. I pleaded with him, my words slurring, but it didn't matter. It would be worth it if Achilles lived. He did not listen. It pierced through my stomach, and Hector twisted it as if stirring soup. He has killed three men with one spear, I thought bitterly. Even the throbbing pain in my stomach did not hurt as much as my heart. The Fates were cruel. As I slowly felt my soul departing, I could only think of the better days, with Achilles. Achilles. It was the last thing I thought before I saw only darkness.     I watched men fight to protect my corpse from harm. I should have been going back to the camp to see Achilles, but I could not do so. How could I, when it felt like I was falling from the walls of Troy again as I watched Achilles wait for me? But knowing that he was now alone, my doubts disappeared. I raced the distance back to camp, the roads familiar. I could pretend that I was simply returning to Achilles, alive and whole, but when my feet did not tire and nobody noticed my presence, I was brought back to reality.   Achilles held my body, screamed his rage for the gods to hear, from the skies to the oceans. Then he softly whispered in the ear of my cold body, sweet murmurs only for me. ""Patroclus."" He says, over and over again until it is sound only. His hair lies on my skin, and for a brief moment I was sure I could feel it.   ""Who has done such a thing?"" He questions, but we both know the answer. ""Hector."" Achilles threw his golden hair back and barked out a laugh, for what has Hector ever done to him? He declared that he would personally kill him. Agamemnon tried to talk to him, only to be met with Achilles' anger. ""I wish he had let you die."" No, I tried to tell him. You are sullying your reputation, what I fought for. He could not listen. Instead he held my body, lifeless and cold. He would not drink or eat, food refusing to touch his lips. When we were finally alone, he moved close to me. If he wrapped me in blankets, and ignored how my chest did not heave, without any need for breathing, he could pretend that I was simply resting, a long slumber that I surely would wake from.   Bury me, my love. Then I can be at rest. I tried to tell him in his sleep. ""Patroclus!"" He sat up, looking around. ""Wait, I am here!"" He calls out into the depths of the tent, shaking my body. When I did not reply, my head hanging limply, he let out a dry sob.   Then he killed and killed, filling the river with bodies of Trojans. 'Hector."" He shouted, the only person he cared about in that instance. Hector begged just as I did, and met the same fate of mine. He dragged his corpse around the walls of Troy for everybody to see. People started to murmur, and I could only watch from afar as he continued to destroy everything we have worked for. I was so close to him, every golden fleck in his eye visible, but he could not see me. Does my death mean nothing? I asked him the night Priam collected his son's corpse, my body festering in our tent. ""I am one step closer to seeing you again, philtatos."" He replied, unhearing. He finally burnt me, but I am still on this earth, waiting. He continued to kill, striking down hero after hero. It was clear that he was driven only by rage, and suppressed grief. He died by the arrow, aided by Apollo. He smiled as it struck him, knowing that he would finally be reunited with me. I caught a fleeting glance of him, his eyes searching the distance for somebody, not knowing that I am just behind him. Before he went, he turned his head and caught my gaze. Then he disappeared.   I felt our ashes mixing. Our souls were finally complete, half of the other's. Yet one was to remain on earth, and the other was a hero in the underworld. I raged when his son did not bury us together, I wept when the Greeks sailed off. I was relieved that they at least honored him, with a tomb that bore the name Achilles, and Achilles only. I had died everyday waiting for him, thinking of reuniting in death. But now, I am afraid that I will be cursed, trapped to roam the earth forever, in search of release. It did not matter, I would continue loving him for a thousand years, if he would let me.      I had no concept of time anymore. People visited his tomb, weaving tales of how he killed, how he had slain his enemies in battle. They spun stories of mine, but my name would always be followed by his. I did not mind-- even if we cannot be together in death, at least we will be remembered as half of a whole. Time stood still, until I saw her, emerging from the sea. She was still ethereally beautiful, carrying herself with a graceful divinity only a god could have. Her mouth stood out, red against the grayish blue hues of the sea. ""Thetis."" I called for her. She left. Day after day she came back, and I felt her presence. It twisted into a frown when she sensed me, lingering at the tomb of her son, prepared to scorn me. I did not care. I would be brave, for what else did I have to lose? ""You said that Chiron ruined him. You are a goddess, and cold, and know nothing. You are the one who ruined him. Look at how he will be remembered now. Killing Hector, killing Troilus. For things he did cruelly in his grief."" I gestured to the descriptions of Achilles killing. To them, they will be reminded of Achilles in a battlefield, the tang of blood and the sound of war. To me, he was the taste of a fig, the musical strum of a lyre, the gold of a sun, and the green of the sea. He was half a god in his heroic tales, and half a mortal to me. She is quiet, and I continue to talk, bitterness in my voice. Had I still been mortal, I would not have dared to speak to her. I would not let her take the things that reminded me of him away from me anymore.  ""Perhaps such things pass for virtue among the gods. But how is there glory in taking a life? We die so easily. Would you make him another Pyrrhus? Let the stories of him be something more."" ""What more?"" She says. For once I am not afraid. What more can she do to me? Every breath, every hour has come to this. I tell her of his deeds, the ones that should be remembered. She tells me of how Pyrrhus died, and I ask if this is the son she prefers to Achilles. ""Have you no more memories?' ""I am made of memories."" It is easy to conjure up the images of the boy I have known and loved. How could I not, when I see them everyday, running through my head? I speak of our first meeting, how I grew to be his therapon, and soon, his philtatos. I speak to her of our time in Pelion, Skyros, in the camps. Achilles has always been the better speaker, but now the words run freely through my mouth, of mourning, melancholy and memories. The words are bittersweet on my tongue, and when I speak of him, I swear I can smell the faintest hits of the oils he used on his ankles.   We sit there, goddess, mortal and the boy who was both. ""I could not make him a god,"" she says. Her jagged voice, rich with grief. ""But you made him."" I tell her, my voice raw, from talking or emotion, I do not know. She does not answer me for a long time, only sits, eyes shining with the last of the dying light. ""I have done it,"" she says. At first I did not understand. But then I see the tomb, and the marks she has made on the stone. ACHILLES, it reads. And beside it, PATROCLUS. ""Go,"" she says. ""He waits for you."" I am one step closer to seeing my beloved. In the hopeless, heavy dusk, I see him. His hair is golden and eyes green, searching. He has been waiting for me for all these years. I cannot move, overcome by remorse and surprise. His eyes meet mine, and he runs towards me, his ankles flashing just like they did when we first met. He pulls me into a strong embrace, sobbing openly. I feel him, his flesh against mine, his tears on my shoulder. ""I have died everyday, waiting for you."" He says, when he finally releases me. I am afraid. This has to be a trick of the Gods, and soon he will disappear in a light of divinity, an illusion. I will find myself in his tomb alone once again. ""Patroclus, do not be afraid. It is me."" He says, and I know that this is not a trick. Pat-tro-clus. It rings clear in my ears, three syllables, the perfect number of harmony, wisdom and understanding. The gods cannot imitate this, and I know he is real. ""I have been waiting for a thousand years."" I tell him, my brown, owlish eyes reflected in his green ones. ""And I shall love you for a thousand more."" He says with certainty. Our hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;0;1;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic

We rode to the walls of Troy, and the Greeks recognised the helmet instantly. A cry shouted, and suddenly they fought with newfound vigor. Was this how Achilles felt? I brandished his spear in my own hand and we rode on, making sure Greeks and Trojans alike saw the mighty Achilles. I forgot when, but I stopped Automedon, and started to fight. I do not remember how many I killed, but there was the son of Zeus, Sarpedon himself. Achilles' armor had lent my strength and power, he was with me, always. I could stop this war myself, pluck Helen from the safely guarded Troy and return her to her cuckold husband. Then Achilles and Hector would not have to die. It was a plan of idiocy, and Apollo himself warned me. I tried scaling the walls of Troy again, but I fell. I did not die from the fall, in some twisted plan of the Fates.   Hector himself loomed over me, his spear in hand. I pleaded with him, my words slurring, but it didn't matter. It would be worth it if Achilles lived. He did not listen. It pierced through my stomach, and Hector twisted it as if stirring soup. He has killed three men with one spear, I thought bitterly. Even the throbbing pain in my stomach did not hurt as much as my heart. The Fates were cruel. As I slowly felt my soul departing, I could only think of the better days, with Achilles. Achilles. It was the last thing I thought before I saw only darkness.     I watched men fight to protect my corpse from harm. I should have been going back to the camp to see Achilles, but I could not do so. How could I, when it felt like I was falling from the walls of Troy again as I watched Achilles wait for me? But knowing that he was now alone, my doubts disappeared. I raced the distance back to camp, the roads familiar. I could pretend that I was simply returning to Achilles, alive and whole, but when my feet did not tire and nobody noticed my presence, I was brought back to reality.   Achilles held my body, screamed his rage for the gods to hear, from the skies to the oceans. Then he softly whispered in the ear of my cold body, sweet murmurs only for me. ""Patroclus."" He says, over and over again until it is sound only. His hair lies on my skin, and for a brief moment I was sure I could feel it.   ""Who has done such a thing?"" He questions, but we both know the answer. ""Hector."" Achilles threw his golden hair back and barked out a laugh, for what has Hector ever done to him? He declared that he would personally kill him. Agamemnon tried to talk to him, only to be met with Achilles' anger. ""I wish he had let you die."" No, I tried to tell him. You are sullying your reputation, what I fought for. He could not listen. Instead he held my body, lifeless and cold. He would not drink or eat, food refusing to touch his lips. When we were finally alone, he moved close to me. If he wrapped me in blankets, and ignored how my chest did not heave, without any need for breathing, he could pretend that I was simply resting, a long slumber that I surely would wake from.   Bury me, my love. Then I can be at rest. I tried to tell him in his sleep. ""Patroclus!"" He sat up, looking around. ""Wait, I am here!"" He calls out into the depths of the tent, shaking my body. When I did not reply, my head hanging limply, he let out a dry sob.   Then he killed and killed, filling the river with bodies of Trojans. 'Hector."" He shouted, the only person he cared about in that instance. Hector begged just as I did, and met the same fate of mine. He dragged his corpse around the walls of Troy for everybody to see. People started to murmur, and I could only watch from afar as he continued to destroy everything we have worked for. I was so close to him, every golden fleck in his eye visible, but he could not see me. Does my death mean nothing? I asked him the night Priam collected his son's corpse, my body festering in our tent. ""I am one step closer to seeing you again, philtatos."" He replied, unhearing. He finally burnt me, but I am still on this earth, waiting. He continued to kill, striking down hero after hero. It was clear that he was driven only by rage, and suppressed grief. He died by the arrow, aided by Apollo. He smiled as it struck him, knowing that he would finally be reunited with me. I caught a fleeting glance of him, his eyes searching the distance for somebody, not knowing that I am just behind him. Before he went, he turned his head and caught my gaze. Then he disappeared.   I felt our ashes mixing. Our souls were finally complete, half of the other's. Yet one was to remain on earth, and the other was a hero in the underworld. I raged when his son did not bury us together, I wept when the Greeks sailed off. I was relieved that they at least honored him, with a tomb that bore the name Achilles, and Achilles only. I had died everyday waiting for him, thinking of reuniting in death. But now, I am afraid that I will be cursed, trapped to roam the earth forever, in search of release. It did not matter, I would continue loving him for a thousand years, if he would let me.      I had no concept of time anymore. People visited his tomb, weaving tales of how he killed, how he had slain his enemies in battle. They spun stories of mine, but my name would always be followed by his. I did not mind-- even if we cannot be together in death, at least we will be remembered as half of a whole. Time stood still, until I saw her, emerging from the sea. She was still ethereally beautiful, carrying herself with a graceful divinity only a god could have. Her mouth stood out, red against the grayish blue hues of the sea. ""Thetis."" I called for her. She left. Day after day she came back, and I felt her presence. It twisted into a frown when she sensed me, lingering at the tomb of her son, prepared to scorn me. I did not care. I would be brave, for what else did I have to lose? ""You said that Chiron ruined him. You are a goddess, and cold, and know nothing. You are the one who ruined him. Look at how he will be remembered now. Killing Hector, killing Troilus. For things he did cruelly in his grief."" I gestured to the descriptions of Achilles killing. To them, they will be reminded of Achilles in a battlefield, the tang of blood and the sound of war. To me, he was the taste of a fig, the musical strum of a lyre, the gold of a sun, and the green of the sea. He was half a god in his heroic tales, and half a mortal to me. She is quiet, and I continue to talk, bitterness in my voice. Had I still been mortal, I would not have dared to speak to her. I would not let her take the things that reminded me of him away from me anymore.  ""Perhaps such things pass for virtue among the gods. But how is there glory in taking a life? We die so easily. Would you make him another Pyrrhus? Let the stories of him be something more."" ""What more?"" She says. For once I am not afraid. What more can she do to me? Every breath, every hour has come to this. I tell her of his deeds, the ones that should be remembered. She tells me of how Pyrrhus died, and I ask if this is the son she prefers to Achilles. ""Have you no more memories?' ""I am made of memories."" It is easy to conjure up the images of the boy I have known and loved. How could I not, when I see them everyday, running through my head? I speak of our first meeting, how I grew to be his therapon, and soon, his philtatos. I speak to her of our time in Pelion, Skyros, in the camps. Achilles has always been the better speaker, but now the words run freely through my mouth, of mourning, melancholy and memories. The words are bittersweet on my tongue, and when I speak of him, I swear I can smell the faintest hits of the oils he used on his ankles.   We sit there, goddess, mortal and the boy who was both. ""I could not make him a god,"" she says. Her jagged voice, rich with grief. ""But you made him."" I tell her, my voice raw, from talking or emotion, I do not know. She does not answer me for a long time, only sits, eyes shining with the last of the dying light. ""I have done it,"" she says. At first I did not understand. But then I see the tomb, and the marks she has made on the stone. ACHILLES, it reads. And beside it, PATROCLUS. ""Go,"" she says. ""He waits for you."" I am one step closer to seeing my beloved. In the hopeless, heavy dusk, I see him. His hair is golden and eyes green, searching. He has been waiting for me for all these years. I cannot move, overcome by remorse and surprise. His eyes meet mine, and he runs towards me, his ankles flashing just like they did when we first met. He pulls me into a strong embrace, sobbing openly. I feel him, his flesh against mine, his tears on my shoulder. ""I have died everyday, waiting for you."" He says, when he finally releases me. I am afraid. This has to be a trick of the Gods, and soon he will disappear in a light of divinity, an illusion. I will find myself in his tomb alone once again. ""Patroclus, do not be afraid. It is me."" He says, and I know that this is not a trick. Pat-tro-clus. It rings clear in my ears, three syllables, the perfect number of harmony, wisdom and understanding. The gods cannot imitate this, and I know he is real. ""I have been waiting for a thousand years."" I tell him, my brown, owlish eyes reflected in his green ones. ""And I shall love you for a thousand more."" He says with certainty. Our hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

But she feels nervous, anxious, angry when she sees the children who bring her the gifts, these reminders of the women she's supposed to supplant.  Her husband tells her it will be alright, though, encourages to take the gifts, to take all that she has been given. So she does, because she's meant to honor her husband in everything (and she saw what happened to the last women who did not, how far she fell).  The princess takes the gifts up to her room, pushes aside her concerns to savor how beautiful they are, for they  are beautiful. She lets the silk run through her fingers before taking off her own clothes so the servants can dress her, letting them style her hair beautifully enough to fit that perfect crown.  When they're done, the woman who looks back on her is nothing less than a queen in the making, a woman truly worthy of being an Argonaut's wife. She smiles, and her reflection smiles back, cool and charming and graceful.  She shows off, because of course she does. She's young and beautiful and she wants to share that youth, that beauty, with others, and wants to know that they believe in her beauty. And a small part of her wants to savor the feeling of the dress and crown for herself, carry this beauty for herself.  And then she feels it. Quick as a slap, but softer, so much softer, the  press of cloth against her skin in a way that she didn't think the dress pressed before. No, she knows it didn't press that way before.  She stiffens as it presses again, cloth rubbing up  between  her legs like....like a hand. Petting her. Touching her  there, where no one's mention to touch her, but her husband. She goes still before everyone's eyes, heart tight in her throat.   Does that feel nice, princess?  a voice purrs at the back of her head.  Are you enjoying yourself, little thing?   A cries slices out of her, shocked and frightened. One of the women watching lets out a cry in response, a sound of pleasure and triumph, and people shout about the spirit of Pan coming upon the princess, what a good omen this must be.   Not Pan,  the voice whispers. The circlet is trembling ever so slightly, buzzing over the princess's skin, and her fingers shake as she presses them to her temples.  Not a god, although we do have our common traits. The voice laughs and it's--it's a woman's voice.  The voice laughs and suddenly she can feel hands all over her body, everywhere and all at once, in every place where the dress touches her skin. She looks down and there's no hands in sight, , but she can feel them pressing, plucking, stroking, squeezing all over her body: shoulders and back, knees and calves, thighs and hips, stomach and arms, her  breasts,  her  ass, her--  She falls to her knees with a sound that's half scream, half moan, nerves light up like fire and burning like poison. The dress bunches between her legs as she lands, folding neatly, almost chastely, all around her. Another moan spills from her, sharp with panic, and she can feel the people shifting around her, caught off guard.    That's it, little slut.  You like it, don't you?    She doesn't, she doesn't, but--it's every little sprout of pleasure she's ever collected on her own, in the dark, has bloomed into a garden, choking her from the inside. She gasps for fair, hips shaking wildly as she claws at the dress, trying to get it off so that she can  think.   But it stays pressed to her flesh like it's stuck to her, like the invisible, impossible hands she can feel running all over her body. Fingers pinch her nipples as if punishment, other hands raining a barrage of noiseless smacks upon her ass, and she screams, twisting and writhing.   Oh, sweet thing,  the voice hums. She can feel wetness gathering between her legs, dragging out of her like wind yanking rain from the sky.  You needed this, didn't you?    Some people are laughing, cheering. Some people are frowning with lectures in their eyes, others with fear. She reaches shaking hands towards them, begging, pleading--for what, she can't say, she can't  think. It's all too much, too much.   Hush, poppet,  and the voice is just a lullaby stroking her inside and out.  I know, I know. Let me help you. The princess sobs, hips juddering frantically against the ground, humping the earth with a desperation she's never even tasted.   Please,  she begs--or maybe she says, it's hard to tell.  Please please please--    Greedy little thing.  The voice is playfully chiding, almost amused.  But if you insist--   The circlet shudders, pulsing against her temples, and she feels some of the hands start to  change, curving and shifting into--into mouths? Yes, mouths pressing against her overheated body, lips working and tugging, tongues sinking deep, and she's breathless, she's screaming, crashing over the edge with a howl.  She slumps back, damp and shaking, and that's when she realizes the hands, the mouths, are still touching her. Her body is on fire and they're throwing whole forests on the flames, dragging her back up the cliff even quicker than before.  ""Please,"" she begs, staring up through blurry, dazed eyes at the world around her. ""Please, someone help, someone--""   Let me help you, then. The dress shoves itself up against her cunt, grinding against her ass. She can feel damp fingers inside her, stretching holes already slick and overwhelmed. Finger after finger, stuffing her full, and she sobs with the pleasure-agony of it.   I'll fuck you better than he ever could, the woman whispers. Now, not a woman--the witch. The princess can see it now, feel the outline of a body with magic buzzing through her just as it buzzes through the circlet and the dress.  She knows who the witch is, of course she does. And she should be angry, furious, horrified, but in her mind's eye the witch looks at her with a smile and the princess comes all over again.   You need more than he can give,  the witch purrs, and the fingers in her cunt curl into a fist, followed slowly, but surely by the ones in her ass.  He would have wasted you like he wasted me. You need more, my darling little bitch, and more, and more--   The fists punch slowly in and out, rock her back and forth, and she's weeping because it is at once far, far too much and not nearly enough. There are mouths sucking her tits and biting her shoulder blades, salvia burning into her blood and pulling her raw, frantic insides into the light.   More, and more, and more, and she's falling over that edge again, and again, and again. There's someone screaming around her, a wanton, fractured voice, there are people shouting about curses from Aphrodite, and inside her head that is her voice, dragging her on and on.   You were born for this. You need it. And she does, she realizes, she does, because now it's her own hands dragging over her own body, over the beautiful soaking clothes that squeeze and torment her. Her cunt is full of fingers and she's trying frantically to jam more in, even it hurts, because she's been so very empty all her life and she cannot take it a second longer.   Oh gods,  the voice inside her groans, soft with triumph and joy, and she repeats it, spilling herself across the grass. The hands in her pussy and start to pull out and she sobs with terror, but the voice whispers  relax, you have a guest.   Then more hands reach for her and she reaches out to take them, feels them connected to a body kneeling in front of her. She doesn't know or care who it is, the witch or something else, because the voice whispers  more and she repeats it as she tackles that body to the ground, feeling between its legs for a flaccid cock that swells at her touch.  The dress lifts the skirt enough for her to pull the cock inside the aching paradise of her cunt, to press against both their bodies so her new playmate starts to shake and moan and thrust, too. She rides that cock with abandon, slamming herself down so wildly it hurts, throwing her head in time with the moans and roars inside her head.   So fucking good, the witch rasps, and she is, she's so fucking good. Somewhere she's aware, distantly, that this is too much, far too much, that she's burning with real pain as much as pleasure now, but the light from the circlet and the gown and her own cooking organs drowns it all out, call waves of desperation like moths to the flame.  The rest of the world doesn't exist, not anymore. Even when the body beneath her comes, filling her insides, it only serves as a heartbeat's relief, more slick to grease her as she moves faster, and faster. She opens her mouth to weep or wail and it feels like fire pouring from her mouth, molten outside as she feels inside.  The voice is quieter now, when it says,  maybe it didn't have to be this way.  A low, weary sigh.  But oh, you feel so beautiful. It has been a long time since I felt anything beautiful. And it is too late to stop it, now.   She's not really processing the words though, not anymore. And when the voice leaves, when the circlet goes cold around her temples, the dress is still alive with motion, with hands and mouths and other things, a tangled loop of sensation that spins and spins all on its own, spins as she burns, burns,  burns.....   No one will be sure how many times the princess came before her heart gave out, overwhelmed by more pleasure and pain, more  sensation, than the human body is equipped to burn. Nobody will know how many times she had screamed the witch's name before slumping down onto the corpse of her father, whose own heart had stopped beating the very first time she dragged an orgasm from his cock.  They will only be sure that she had tears staining her cheeks as she slumped to the ground, dripping with the evidence of her ruin. And that her lips curved into the ghost of a smile, reflecting the glassy joy in her eyes as they stared up at any unforgiving sky.";;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;1;0;0;0;semantic;0;1;1;0;semantic

But I told you so. I told you this would happen. But no! No one listens to me. No one listened to me and now the city walls have fallen, and the great citadel of Troy is nothing but a smoking pile of stone.  I know what you people say about me. 'Pity her, Cassandra, in her madness!' Or 'keep your eyes down, or else you'll bring the same god's wrath upon yourself!' Or if you're my mother: 'shut up Cassandra! Take her back to her room, would you?' It's not really your fault. You definitely won't believe me, but I might as well narrate my life to you- hey, you'll geta fun story out of it!  I used to be the crown jewel of the Trojan royal family, y'know? I was the beautiful and dutiful princess, devoted to her gods, to the god Apollo before all others. I was the favoured daughter, and I could have brought the family great pride by marrying a great king of a far away place, or I could have stayed home and become a favoured priestess of Apollo.  But I was too beautiful. I was too dutiful.  Men may see the attention of the gods as a good thing; see my brother Paris, favourite of Aphrodite (not that it really worked out for him), or amongst the Greeks see Odysseus and Diomedes, favoured by Athena. Men gain fame, luck, and undue honours from being a god's favourite.  Women get no such prize.  Now, I was faithful to the god Apollo before all others. I would spend hours each day in his temple, serving him, devoted above all others. And thus, he noticed me. I was in the temple one night, performing the customary daily rites to Apollo, when I started to feel tired. I thought to myself, sleeping in the temple wouldn't hurt would it? I'd done it before and nothing had happened. So I pulled out a spare straw pallet, and I fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night, feeling some sort of... presence watching me. So, I wake up, I blink sleep from my eyes, and I look around. There's a glowing figure at my side, and I instantly know who it is.  I've been watching you, Cassandra. He spoke. You've been so loyal, so good for me, haven't you? What if I told you I could offer you the gift of prophecy as a reward? You'd like that, wouldn't you?   And of course, I answer yes, because prophecy? Hell yeah, who'd turn that down? And in that moment, I feel his hand on my head and I see a thousand images flash before my eyes, and its beautiful.   You'd do anything for me, wouldn't you? Anything I ask of you?    And I answer yes to this as well, because when he says anything he asked of me, I assumed he'd ask for my eternal devotion to him. I assumed he'd ask for my life, and I'd willingly give it to him. I didn't assume he'd ask me for anything else, because I was twelve and devoting my doll to the temple of Artemis was just crossing the threshold of my mind.  I was twelve.  I was TWELVE!  He comes closer to me and pulls me into an embrace, and even though it's the god Apollo and he's just given me the gift of prophecy, I can't, I just can't, and I pull away from his smiling face and his face turns, and suddenly I see the displeasure in his eyes, and suddenly- A thousand of images flash before my eyes and I scream.  After that night, I was no longer the crown jewel of Troy. I was the curse upon the royal family, a blight to be locked away. I was cursed to see the future- but no one would ever believe me.  So when I saw Paris reunited with our family, I mourned for the loss of Troy over a decade before its happening. When I saw Helen enter the citadel, I screamed my lungs out and tried to tear her beautiful head from her body, hoping the gods would see it fit for her return to her lawful husband. When I saw Andromache holding little Astyanax in her arms with Hector smiling beside them, I saw her screaming out for her baby while Astyanax had his brains dashed out on the city walls. I saw Hector's dead and defiled body, feet pinned together, dragged by Achilles' chariot. I saw my mother weep for her children on the shore. I saw Polydorus' body wash up on the shore, Polyxena with her blood seeping out into the dirt, and my father dead in the same manner as his grandson.  I saw everything.  I saw my own rape at the hands of Ajax the Lesser. I can still feel his hands prying me off the statue of Athena I had clung to. I can still hear my screams as I plead to the goddess to save me, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything, because have I not always given her my dues? Have I not been pious and good? People will say that she was so moved by my pleas for mercy that grey-eyed Athena's statue turned her face away from the sight, but I call bullshit. If the so-called maiden goddess truly had pity for those of her sex, she would have saved me and every woman in Troy from those damned Greeks.  And thus now, you find me here, sitting on the shore with my family- well, the women of the family, because the men are all dead now- and the other remaining women of Troy, waiting to be picked out as war prizes for the victors.  My mother will be given to devious Odysseus, and thus will have the best fate of all of us.

But I told you so. I told you this would happen. But no! No one listens to me. No one listened to me and now the city walls have fallen, and the great citadel of Troy is nothing but a smoking pile of stone.  I know what you people say about me. 'Pity her, Cassandra, in her madness!' Or 'keep your eyes down, or else you'll bring the same god's wrath upon yourself!' Or if you're my mother: 'shut up Cassandra! Take her back to her room, would you?' It's not really your fault. You definitely won't believe me, but I might as well narrate my life to you- hey, you'll geta fun story out of it!  I used to be the crown jewel of the Trojan royal family, y'know? I was the beautiful and dutiful princess, devoted to her gods, to the god Apollo before all others. I was the favoured daughter, and I could have brought the family great pride by marrying a great king of a far away place, or I could have stayed home and become a favoured priestess of Apollo.  But I was too beautiful. I was too dutiful.  Men may see the attention of the gods as a good thing; see my brother Paris, favourite of Aphrodite (not that it really worked out for him), or amongst the Greeks see Odysseus and Diomedes, favoured by Athena. Men gain fame, luck, and undue honours from being a god's favourite.  Women get no such prize.  Now, I was faithful to the god Apollo before all others. I would spend hours each day in his temple, serving him, devoted above all others. And thus, he noticed me. I was in the temple one night, performing the customary daily rites to Apollo, when I started to feel tired. I thought to myself, sleeping in the temple wouldn't hurt would it? I'd done it before and nothing had happened. So I pulled out a spare straw pallet, and I fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night, feeling some sort of... presence watching me. So, I wake up, I blink sleep from my eyes, and I look around. There's a glowing figure at my side, and I instantly know who it is.  I've been watching you, Cassandra. He spoke. You've been so loyal, so good for me, haven't you? What if I told you I could offer you the gift of prophecy as a reward? You'd like that, wouldn't you?   And of course, I answer yes, because prophecy? Hell yeah, who'd turn that down? And in that moment, I feel his hand on my head and I see a thousand images flash before my eyes, and its beautiful.   You'd do anything for me, wouldn't you? Anything I ask of you?    And I answer yes to this as well, because when he says anything he asked of me, I assumed he'd ask for my eternal devotion to him. I assumed he'd ask for my life, and I'd willingly give it to him. I didn't assume he'd ask me for anything else, because I was twelve and devoting my doll to the temple of Artemis was just crossing the threshold of my mind.  I was twelve.  I was TWELVE!  He comes closer to me and pulls me into an embrace, and even though it's the god Apollo and he's just given me the gift of prophecy, I can't, I just can't, and I pull away from his smiling face and his face turns, and suddenly I see the displeasure in his eyes, and suddenly- A thousand of images flash before my eyes and I scream.  After that night, I was no longer the crown jewel of Troy. I was the curse upon the royal family, a blight to be locked away. I was cursed to see the future- but no one would ever believe me.  So when I saw Paris reunited with our family, I mourned for the loss of Troy over a decade before its happening. When I saw Helen enter the citadel, I screamed my lungs out and tried to tear her beautiful head from her body, hoping the gods would see it fit for her return to her lawful husband. When I saw Andromache holding little Astyanax in her arms with Hector smiling beside them, I saw her screaming out for her baby while Astyanax had his brains dashed out on the city walls. I saw Hector's dead and defiled body, feet pinned together, dragged by Achilles' chariot. I saw my mother weep for her children on the shore. I saw Polydorus' body wash up on the shore, Polyxena with her blood seeping out into the dirt, and my father dead in the same manner as his grandson.  I saw everything.  I saw my own rape at the hands of Ajax the Lesser. I can still feel his hands prying me off the statue of Athena I had clung to. I can still hear my screams as I plead to the goddess to save me, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything, because have I not always given her my dues? Have I not been pious and good? People will say that she was so moved by my pleas for mercy that grey-eyed Athena's statue turned her face away from the sight, but I call bullshit. If the so-called maiden goddess truly had pity for those of her sex, she would have saved me and every woman in Troy from those damned Greeks.  And thus now, you find me here, sitting on the shore with my family- well, the women of the family, because the men are all dead now- and the other remaining women of Troy, waiting to be picked out as war prizes for the victors.  My mother will be given to devious Odysseus, and thus will have the best fate of all of us.

""";indirect thought;third;Eurynomus;Eurynomus;;;;;Odysseus;Odysseus;;;;;slaying;arrow;;;;;"Twenty years, and it seems the world has fallen apart.  Oh not for other kingdoms.  Across Greece, kingdoms were beginning to pull themselves back together, to right their world and move on from the war that had seen every able-bodied man summoned to arms.  Thebes and Pylos and Corinth and even Mycenae were now stable and thriving once more, their sons returned and their thrones filled.  Even Sparta bowed happily to their rescued Queen Helen.  Treasures from the victory at Troy filled Greek coffers and palaces.  But not Ithaca.  Ithaca still languished in uncertainty, her king neither returned nor declared dead.  Odysseus was hailed across Greece for his ingenuity.  It was his brilliance, so the rumors went, that conquered Troy at last, after a decade of war.  But where then was his share of the spoils of that victory?  Where was he?  And the rest of the men he'd taken with him?  Ten years had passed since Troy burned, and the King of Ithaca had vanished, leaving a kingdom and a wife in devastating limbo.  A generation of young men had grown up in the meantime.  Grown up without fathers and older brothers, left with only the babes in arms and the elderly and the women, wailing and grieving their husbands.  And then, as the weeks bled into months bled into years, taking the reins of power - of their children and homes and cities - into their hands.  Eurynomus was one of those children.  Only twelve when the war began, told he was too young to raise a sword, he'd watched his father and elder brother leave instead with their king.  He remembered how galling it had been when word reached the island of young Prince Neoptolemus of Phthia, sailing for Troy after the death of his hero father Achilles.  Neoptolemus was younger than Eurynomus had been at the start of the war, and yet he'd been ordered to stay behind.  Stay behind and guard his family home and support his mother, but his mother refused to heed a child too young to bear arms and serve his king.  When the years continued to pass, and returning heroes trickled home everywhere except Ithaca, Eurynomus had agreed with the other young men of his generation.  No one was coming back.  King Odysseus' vaunted divine favor had deserted him, surely he must be drowned beneath the sea, along with Eurynomus' father and brother and everyone else who'd sailed so long ago.  Ithaca must accept her tragedy and move on.  And the best way to show that would be in the remarriage of Ithaca's Queen.  Eurynomus didn't really expect wise, beautiful, Penelope to choose him.  Her cousin Helen had overlooked Eurynomus' father all those decades ago.  But Antinous had encouraged him to press his suit.  The more young men courted the Queen, the more she'd have to eventually face the harsh truth of her widowhood and the desperate need of her kingdom.  The more she'd have to choose someone.  Anyone.  And tonight would be the final confrontation.  The Queen had put them off long enough.  Now they knew her pious pleading to finish the shroud of her (former) father-in-law was nothing but a delaying tactic, they would catch her in the act.  She would choose her next husband and king tonight.  *  The maid Melantho led the pack of suitors to her mistress' quarters.  Eurynomus' fingers clenched at the sword at his hip as he skulked through the palace corridors as quietly as he could.  He saw others of his fellow suitors do the same.  Melantho stealthily opened the door to the Queen's bedchamber.  And there she was, the deceitful jade.  Hunched over her loom, painstakingly undoing her stitches by torchlight.  Queen Penelope startled as Melantho, Antinous, and Eurymachus were the first to burst inside the sanctity of her woman's chamber.  Eurynomus pushed his way forward in the middle of the crowd of men.  As they tumbled into the room, he could see Penelope's white face as she leapt to her feet.  ""What is the meaning of this?  How dare you violate my chamber?""  ""Us, my lady?"" sneered Antinous, reaching out to grab Penelope's arm, halting her flight.  ""How dare you deceive us like this?  You gave us your word, and we in our mercy and our respect for you and our deceased king allowed you this grace.  And now we see you committing such treachery.  Destroying your own work, which you'd pleaded to be your final act of widowhood.  No, my lady, you will choose your next husband tonight.""  Eurynomus saw Penelope's face harden.  Gone was the modest, pious Queen hosting them.  In her place stood a goddess carved from marble, tall and grave, eyes flashing in contempt that sat oddly on her lovely, feminine face.  ""It took you four years to discover such 'treachery'?  And I see from my maid's presence here tonight that it still wasn't your own realization.  And you - all of you - wonder why I refuse to choose any one of you as my husband?  Odysseus is alive and will return to me, I know that the same way I know the beat of my own heart or the pulse of my own blood.  But even if he were now a shade beneath the cold ground, I would never choose any one of you.""  Eurynomus stared at her, frozen in place.  He could feel the blood rush to his cheeks as he saw her scorn.  The men around him also stood rooted in place by the force of the Queen's presence.  Silence hung for a moment, and Eurynomus held his breath with it.  And then Antinous laughed, a harsh, ugly sound.  ""Then you won't choose at all.""    He yanked Penelope forward into his arms and clasped her tight, creasing and bunching the fragile linen of her gown.  Eurynomus heard a soft feminine gasp at the manhandling.  The small sound should have given him pause, made his heart cringe away.  But instead, something lower stirred.  His breath hitched when Antinous pulled Penelope into a rough kiss.  Penelope's lips looked so soft and red, and the sound she made was so sweet, Eurynomus suddenly wanted nothing more than to taste her.    The man beside him leaned forward, jostling Eurynomus' arm.  Around him, men jockeyed for a better view.  He could hear others' breaths coming hot and loud as they watched Antinous kiss the Queen.    Finally, Penelope pulled away.  She was no longer the unassailable goddess as she stared at the men invading her sanctuary.  Instead, she looked shaken, frightened, smaller.  And perhaps more beautiful than Eurynomus had ever seen her.  Before anyone else could move, Antinous reached out again.  Penelope's hands came up defensively, but Antinous grabbed not for her face but the neckline of her chiton.  The loud rip of fabric made Eurynomus jump.  Penelope stood before them, bared to the waist, face flushing rapidly.  Her heaving breaths matched his own in a way that captivated him.  The switch from frozen tableau to frenzied attack was sudden and brutal.  Eurymachus began it, declaring that he wanted his turn before grabbing Penelope and pulling her into a kiss of his own.  More sounds of rent fabric filled the room, along with the lustful pans of Eurynomus and his fellow suitors and the soft, unintelligible protests from the woman they all wanted.  Then everyone was moving forward in a way, Eurynomus swept along, as they pushed and then dragged Penelope deeper into the room.  Toward the storied bed she'd shared with Odysseus so many years ago.  They gathered around the bed, and Eurynomus found himself at one corner.  For a moment, the significance of his surroundings distracted him.  He reached up to lay a trembling hand on the beautiful olive tree trunk that formed the bedpost.  It was said that Odysseus himself had carved this marriage bed with his own hands.  And now, it would see its mistress choose Odysseus' successor.    He heard Penelope protest again, louder now.  When he looked, she was naked now, held still by Antinous on one arm and Eurymachus on the other.  Antinous' other hand had a tight grip on her hair, pulling her neck painfully taut.  And it hit Eurynomus then.  This was really happening.  And if he stayed the course and followed Antinous and Eurymachus' lead, he'd get his own turn in bed with the Queen of Ithaca.  He'd never be chosen, he'd always known.  But he could be part of this one night.  He winced in sympathy when Antinous threw Penelope onto the great bed, but the sight of her lovely form, bare and stretched taut, chased away his discomfort.    After a brief argument, Antinous asserted his leadership and claimed first place.  As other men moved in to bind Penelope's arms and long, slender legs to the bed, he took his position between her spread thighs.    Eurynomus couldn't take his eyes off the scene before him.  He couldn't see much of the queen, blanketed as she was by Antinous' strong young body.  But when, screaming the loveliest sound he'd ever hear, Penelope suddenly bucked and arched, bound limbs going rigid, he knew she'd been taken.  ""Don't worry, my lady,"" Eurymachus half soothed, half mocked from his place near Penelope's head.  ""You're a widow, not a virgin.  This night brings you no shame.  But after suffering your years of deception, I think we all deserve this.""  Eurymachus grinned at the gathered men, and Eurynomus could swear the other looked right at him for a brief second.  Wealthy, highborn, charming Eurymachus, whom most here had privately tipped as the one to win, who had never acknowledged Eurynomus directly before in all their years in this endeavor together, had met his eyes and wordlessly promised him his due.    This might be the true prize that Eurynomus would remember from tonight.  A high keening wail drew his attention back to the activity on the bed, and he quickly shook the thought away.  No.  Having Penelope, tasting and touching and taking her, was the prize.  The gift.  Even just for one night.  Antinous was plundering her rapidly, hips snapping far too roughly.  Eurynomus grimaced as he watched.  Antinous' good looks and birth were enviable, but his brutishness would draw the ire of Eurynomus' father.    Antinous' mouth descended on Penelope's again, swallowing and muffling her pained screams.  And then Eurynomus saw his rhythm speed up, almost impossibly quick and erratic, slamming against Penelope's soft body over and over until, with a loud groan, it was done.  Eurymachus was next, of course, and soon Eurynomus saw why he'd agreed to yield first place to Antinous.  Eurymachus got between Penelope's thighs and slid two fingers into her spread, reddened womanhood.  Then he smiled.  ""Nice and wet for me.""  Penelope gave a low moan as Eurymachus slipped inside her.  Eurynomus watched with wide eyes, one hand slipping inside his own garment to palm his hardening member.  A quick glance around confirmed that he wasn't the only one enjoying the scene.  Others were stripping off and gripping their stiff manhoods.  Eurymachus' head was buried in Penelope's soft neck.  His lips whispered words to her that Eurynomus could not make out, but he saw her head toss and heard her soft, repeated ""No""s clearly.  And then Eurymachus' head lifted, he smiled down at her with all his considerable charm, as if he were not at that very moment violating her.  And Eurynomus watched as Penelope spat in his handsome face.  Eurymachus' hand flashed up, almost too quick to follow, and cracked against Penelope's fair cheek.  Eurynomus and several others around him flinched at the sudden violence.  Eurymachus was still grinning, even as spittle dripped down his own cheek.  ""How low class, my queen.  When you are my wife, I'll teach you better manners.  But if you wish to play the slattern, I suppose this is the night to do so.""  Eurymachus continued his turn as if there'd been no interruption.  A few of the younger men crowded around the bed began urging him to hurry up, but he paid them no heed.  His head dropped back to her neck, and this time his lips and teeth kissed and sucked the creamy exposed flesh.  ""I'll leave my mark on you, my queen.  You'll remember that I marked you first.""  When one young suitor suddenly spilled into his own hand and over Penelope's long dark hair, it was as if a dam had burst.    Eurynomus and everyone else realized that Penelope's body was there for them, too.  Displayed for them to touch and spoil as they waited their own turns between her thighs.  He stroked her foot and delicately turned ankle, smiling at the feel of her silken skin.  Rounding the corner of the bed, he bent to run his tongue up her slender calf.  The limb, still bound fast, jumped and trembled at his touch.  Dimly, he heard her cries as others converged on her.  He tuned them out, focusing on the smooth female flesh in his hands.  He massaged her calf, fascinated by the softness, then kissed just above her knee.  It was too bad he couldn't untie her, his mouth watered at the thought of tasting the tender underside of her knee.  But he didn't dare suggest it.  Instead, he moved further up, to her thigh.  He was jostling for position now, trying to stay within reach as he butted up against other men seeking to feel her breasts, her stomach.  The third man to claim his turn inside her was between her spread thighs.  Eurynomus knew the moment he entered her, as the strong muscles in Penelope's thigh went taut, tendons straining against Eurynomus' open mouth.  Penelope's cries grew louder and more strained as the night continued.  Eurynomus drank her in, one hand on his own hard manhood, as he waited his turn.  He lost his position by her thigh, and sometimes he couldn't see much of her, swarmed as she was.  Men's hands covered her breasts and hips and lovely throat.  More hands tangled in the long, dark fall of her hair, moving her head as her mouth was used.   It was oddly quiet in the crowded room, the main sounds being the slick slap of flesh on flesh and Penelope's low gags and moans.  No one, Eurynomus noticed, was interested in profaning this gift of the queen with bawdy talk.  She'd be the wife of one of them after tonight, after all.  Sometimes the one between her thighs would whisper endearments or assurances, or even soft reminders of why this was happening now.  But overall, the air of reverence held.  Finally, it was Eurynomus' turn.  He got between her thighs and lined himself up, his hardness aching and almost oversensitive after such a long wait.  But the prize at the end was well worth all his patience, both tonight and over the past few years.    She was hot, tight, and slick as he entered her in one slide.  One hand found her breast, squeezing the firm globe, while the other gripped her hip to steady them both.  Her face was streaked with tears, spit, and semen.  And her eyes, as he took her, held his, her stare burning into him even as another suitor's cock claimed her mouth.  Not caring to focus on those fierce eyes, Eurynomus buried his face in her breasts.  She had the body of a maiden a decade younger than her own years.  His mouth eagerly feasted on her as his hips moved against hers, chasing his pleasure.  Lord Eurymachus' words from earlier, his boast of leaving his mark on the queen, came back to him.  He could do that too. He would never be chosen as her husband, but he could ensure that her body remembered his presence tonight.    He sucked and bit his mark into first one breast and then the other.  He could feel her scream reverberating through his own body as he marked and claimed her.  As his climax hit, he didn't have time to draw breath and recover before someone pushed him away, demanding their ride.  Eurynomus stumbled back from the bed, legs shaking, utterly spent.  But before he melted back into the crowd, he saw the fresh bruise blooming on one perfect breast, and smiled.  The night continued.  Antinous and Eurymachus continued to direct the flow of men, and some were beginning to ask if they'd get another turn.  Eurynomus, leaning now against the thick bedpost, didn't jockey for more.himself, although he idly thought of trying the queen's mouth, just to say later that he had.  But no, it was wrong to be greedy.    *  Eurynomus didn't hear the drawing of the bow, but he couldn't miss the arrowhead suddenly piercing through Antinous' neck.  Blood spurted, spraying Eurynomus and the ones near him.  Eurynomus tried to reach for his own weapon, but he'd lost his belt and sword somewhere during the night.  Then the man beside him was dropping with a scream, and Eurynomus saw the arrow shaft protruding from his chest.  More screams rose around him, a harsh echo of Penelope's earlier cries.  Some part of Eurynomus recognized that her voice could no longer be heard in the fracas.  Scrambling for something to use as a shield, Eurynomus brought one hand up in front of himself.  Only to encounter a sudden, sharp pain.  He dropped to the floor in agony, and stared down at the arrow impaling his hand.  Blinking against the pain, he looked up and saw the cause of the sudden carnage.    Odysseus, King of Ithaca, had returned.  Eurynomus gaped, heart pounding and hand throbbing, mouth open in search of words that would not come.  He saw Odysseus turn towards him.  Saw the flash of a sword.  And then everything went black.

Oh not for other kingdoms.  Across Greece, kingdoms were beginning to pull themselves back together, to right their world and move on from the war that had seen every able-bodied man summoned to arms.  Thebes and Pylos and Corinth and even Mycenae were now stable and thriving once more, their sons returned and their thrones filled.  Even Sparta bowed happily to their rescued Queen Helen.  Treasures from the victory at Troy filled Greek coffers and palaces.  But not Ithaca.  Ithaca still languished in uncertainty, her king neither returned nor declared dead.  Odysseus was hailed across Greece for his ingenuity.  It was his brilliance, so the rumors went, that conquered Troy at last, after a decade of war.  But where then was his share of the spoils of that victory?  Where was he?  And the rest of the men he'd taken with him?  Ten years had passed since Troy burned, and the King of Ithaca had vanished, leaving a kingdom and a wife in devastating limbo.  A generation of young men had grown up in the meantime.  Grown up without fathers and older brothers, left with only the babes in arms and the elderly and the women, wailing and grieving their husbands.  And then, as the weeks bled into months bled into years, taking the reins of power - of their children and homes and cities - into their hands.  Eurynomus was one of those children.  Only twelve when the war began, told he was too young to raise a sword, he'd watched his father and elder brother leave instead with their king.  He remembered how galling it had been when word reached the island of young Prince Neoptolemus of Phthia, sailing for Troy after the death of his hero father Achilles.  Neoptolemus was younger than Eurynomus had been at the start of the war, and yet he'd been ordered to stay behind.  Stay behind and guard his family home and support his mother, but his mother refused to heed a child too young to bear arms and serve his king.  When the years continued to pass, and returning heroes trickled home everywhere except Ithaca, Eurynomus had agreed with the other young men of his generation.  No one was coming back.  King Odysseus' vaunted divine favor had deserted him, surely he must be drowned beneath the sea, along with Eurynomus' father and brother and everyone else who'd sailed so long ago.  Ithaca must accept her tragedy and move on.  And the best way to show that would be in the remarriage of Ithaca's Queen.  Eurynomus didn't really expect wise, beautiful, Penelope to choose him.  Her cousin Helen had overlooked Eurynomus' father all those decades ago.  But Antinous had encouraged him to press his suit.

So she doesn't cry, not at the funeral or her initial death.""";indirect thought;third;Riliane's mother;Riliane;;;;;---;self;;;;;unspecified;jumping;;;;;When Riliane is young, she learns stories. Myths from worlds long gone past, dug from the ruins of a museum that dug them up from ruins. Stories where the gods can be kind or cruel, stories with dashing heroes and creatures she doesn't dare imagine. Her favorite is that of the Trojan princess Cassandra. A tragedy, and yet she memories it and carves the tale into her heart.     When she is still younger, they call her intuitive. She always seems to know when trouble will happen and avoids it. They call it reflex, hypervigilance caused by near constant assassination attempts. When she tells them she dreams of them, they tell her she is plagued by nightmares, and tell her they will fade as she grows.     When she is older, and still gets visions of things yet to happen, they call her mad behind closed doors, before swearing her to secrecy about such things in public. She is taught to feel ashamed of a talent that has saved her life many a time. She is no witch, and her dreams are not purple, so of what significance are they other than a sign of her sanity escaping. She shares a dream once, of a drought, in the council room, and that is all it takes to be outcast.     The drought happens, of course, but why worry about that when the world could point and laugh at the crazy princess, who sees things in her sleep and is convinced they are real in the daytime. If she was not the heir, they would have locked her up in a tower somewhere or sent her to a convent to be forgotten, because it is much easier to discredit than to listen.    But she is the heir, so they do the next best thing: betroth her as soon as possible and make sure the ministry will always have more power than she does. Any supporter she has after that, the ones that call her a prophetess or a Saint, quickly dissappear. But now she has a word for what she sees: prophecies.     She sees her mother's death long before it happens, yet cannot bring herself to mourn the woman who sealed her fate. So she doesn't cry, not at the funeral or her initial death. And the few tears she sheds are not for the late queen, but for the loss of her future. And the loss of a brother, not allowed to come to the palace to serve the insane princess. Perhaps that is what truly seals her fate.     She sees the future in all its bloody glory, and she knows the ministry will be her end. They are foolish, quick to take insult, and quick to line their pockets. They will spark war, and people will die, and they will come for her head. They could use her foresight, but that would require hoping off their pedestals they made for themselves. And that is unthinkable to them.     So she allows it all, does not even speak if she doesn't have too. But she thinks. Thinks of the tailor's daughter she will be soon, and thinks of that brutal fate. She thinks of the Postman, before realizing it wouldn't change much to live that way now. But most of all, she thinks of Cassandra. And little by little she realizes how very alike they are. She wonders if they are one in the same, and the next night she dreams of Troy burning, and of Ajax. She vomits afterwards, before taking a bath and trying to scrub away the skin he touched as he held her down.      When the revolution happens, she stands on the balcony farthest from them, though they all but surround the castle. Still, there are spots they have not circled around to. And so she looks out. And she wonders if she's willing to live a bit longer only for another Ajax or Agamemmnon to come for her. She is not. And so she jumps off the balcony. And Cassandra dies, not for the first or last time.;;;1;0;0;0;fuzzy;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

I stood on the bow of the royal Mycenean ship, breathing in the salt of the sea as if I were the figurehead made flesh, watching the choppy waves disappear one by one beneath creaking wood. Fog was on the horizon, fog was behind us . . . but I knew that were Aeolus to sweep it away, my now-ashen birthplace would not appear. The western fortress, my final destination, was still obscured by distance. I could only see where the sky meets the sea. We were alone in the water, with no past or future landing in sight.    I was glad not to see a shore in the distance. The one I left was covered with a smoking ruin and the flailing bodies of wailing, ragged women. And I know the one I would land on held no happiness for me. I could already feel my captor's warm blood covering me, feeling the quick wind as the axe descends upon me, its next sacrifice. His wife will kill him from behind but will look me in the eyes when she rounded on me. He will die happily, moving inside me. His wife will have the audacity to be   jealous   of me, who will die while her husband rapes me once again. I have prophesied the raging madness in her stare.    I don't need the power of prophecy to know that I would fall ill if I remain where I am, but I far preferred being cold for a while than returning to him. Perhaps a wave might sweep me overboard and drag me under-but I knew how my life ended, and it would not be at sea. He wished to cover me in his heat, to make me warm to him, but I could not. As if as his slave I could possibly have any choice in loving him! The best I could hope for is to be resigned, for my body and soul to stop fighting the reality that I was chattel, the spoils of war.     When I was free, I loved another, a man with whom I now regret never sharing all of myself. It was another mistake I made: a curse was put on my body as well as my tongue: should any man take me to his bed and take me fully, he would be killed not long after. I should have foreseen it...that my dear one would be slain during the city's fall regardless. Some had the good luck to die quickly, a sword to the neck or the heart. Instead, he died slowly watching me writhe in pain as a now-dead Greek ripped my virginity from my body, filling every orifice until I bled. I have already brought two men to their end, one innocent, one not, and I will again. I am She Who Entangles Men indeed.    I was born to be a queen. Troy was at its height then . . . before I became a priestess, I was raised to lie in the bed of a foreign king as his consort. That I have accomplished, but I was destined to be a queen, not a slave. Agamemnon, King of Kings, rests on linens below deck, likely lying awake and anticipating my return. I will make him wait. My body will be his for the remainder of his life.    Of thousands of women, he picked me, the one who didn't know how to pleasure him. And yet, he doesn't want to use me, he wants me to enjoy him. He has been patient with me, and gentle. He says he will overthrow his wife and make me queen, though I know it cannot happen: she is too sharp, too cool, and calculating-she is a woman built to survive. I do not doubt that Agamemnon truly cared for me, but I will not return to him now. My heart no longer even belonged to Coroebus, my beloved Prince of Phrygia. He is dead and now I cared for no one.     I should have been content with this lot. At least when I was in Agamemnon's bed I could lose myself in pleasure for a little while. Other women were used every day by many Greeks the way I was during the fall of Troy. I heard their screams elsewhere on the ship.     When I last embraced my mother, parting on the once-Trojan shore, I held her tear-swollen face in my hands, and leveling my green eyes to her blue bloodshot ones, told her to be happy for me. Was I not the most fortunate of Trojan women? I was to be ""married"" to the King of Kings! He takes me with his lust and also shows me kindness. He seems to   care   what I think of him. Or did he merely want me to want him back so I would be a better lover?    The first night in his tent, I curled up like a baby when he touched me. I was still aching, still bleeding from the violation on Athena's altar. I feared he would do what many soldiers were doing to unwilling women: forcing them onto their hands and knees and taking them that way, rubbing their lovely faces into the dust so they won't scream. I watched the fighting from Troy's walls. I knew Agamemnon was a brutal man with a blood lust, but he never forced me-not that first night or the next. Of course, there is no consenting as a slave. All of it was rape.     I think he even feared me that night; what might I do to him if I were provoked? He knew what Ajax did to me during the city's fall; what I had already experienced. He knew that I was filled with wrath and rage. Would I slit his throat in his satisfied, post-coital sleep? Would I attempt to once again invoke Athena and Apollo's wrath upon him and all the Greeks? He didn't even look at me again until the next night, when I had become numb and lay still as he explored me, trying in vain to make me rise to him.     When I realized he wanted to pretend to make love to me, to hear what sounds I made in ecstasy, I allowed him to touch me. For those moments, as he drew out my climax, I could pretend that everyone I loved was still alive, my home was not a smoldering ruin, and that I was free. When he was done with me, I slept in a dreamless escape from this existence I could not call a life.     -    The ship bounced on a wave and I lost my balance, falling backward onto the deck rather than forward into the spitting sea. I clutched my side, knowing I would rise in the morning covered in bruises. I tried to stand up but was tangled in my soaked and water-heavy chiton.    ""Cassandra!"" Agamemnon shouted for me, running up the steps from the hold. I said nothing, and he repeated his cry, ""Cassandra!"" He was now by my side, brushing my arm with his fingertips, ""Are you all right?"" He didn't wait for an answer and picked me up as if I were a bundle of rags. I suppose he expected me to hold him around the neck as if I were drawn to him. I let my arms hang down.    He carefully carried me down the steps into the hold, nearly banging his head as he entered. We had our own small room there, where the stolen treasures of Troy surrounded a bed. I prayed he wouldn't lay me down on it and begin to undo the brooches on my dress, telling me something heart-wrenchingly silly: that I was more beautiful than Helen, that I was the greatest treasure amongst all the plunder of Troy. Because that's what I was: plunder. I was no longer a woman, I was a thing. I was relieved when he set me down and stood me on my feet.    He stood across from me but didn't look at my face. He looked below my chin, my neck, down to where the soaked white linen revealed the darknesses of my nipples beneath. I stared blankly at him; I began to shiver violently. My whole body quaked, and I wanted to shrink to the floor and be a coddled child again. I remained silent as he again ran his hands over the droplets on my arms, brushing tears of water to the wooden floor.    I remained silent as he undid the brooches of my chiton and tenderly wrapped me in a blanket and carried me to the bed. I thought of my once-great city which was now a smoking pile of ash. Mycenae would fall one day too.     I remained silent as Agamemnon removed all of his garments and unraveled the blanket to press the warmth of his skin against me. He would try once again to plant life inside me. There was no use in telling him that as soon as we saw land we would shortly all be dead. I had given up on trying to make people believe me.     What good had it done?     My father Priam was dead.    My brothers Hector, Deiphobus, Paris, Antiphus, Pammon, Hipponous, Polydorus, and Troilus are dead.    My sisters Creusa and Polyxena are dead.    My great love Coroebus is dead.    My mother Hecuba, my sister Laodice, my twin brother Helenus...all slaves now like me, headed for unknown shores. We were all once powerful in a powerful kingdom.     We were Trojan.    There is no Troy anymore. Apollo will watch me sleeping elsewhere. I will see the sun setting in fiery pinks and oranges over a different horizon.     Agamemnon moved his hands to spread my legs.     I would die, but I knew Troy would live on in the stories told by all who knew of the dream it once was. I had foreseen it.   Lift up, heave up, carry the flame!

It was another mistake I made: a curse was put on my body as well as my tongue: should any man take me to his bed and take me fully, he would be killed not long after. I should have foreseen it...that my dear one would be slain during the city's fall regardless. Some had the good luck to die quickly, a sword to the neck or the heart. Instead, he died slowly watching me writhe in pain as a now-dead Greek ripped my virginity from my body, filling every orifice until I bled. I have already brought two men to their end, one innocent, one not, and I will again. I am She Who Entangles Men indeed.    I was born to be a queen. Troy was at its height then . . . before I became a priestess, I was raised to lie in the bed of a foreign king as his consort. That I have accomplished, but I was destined to be a queen, not a slave. Agamemnon, King of Kings, rests on linens below deck, likely lying awake and anticipating my return. I will make him wait. My body will be his for the remainder of his life.    Of thousands of women, he picked me, the one who didn't know how to pleasure him. And yet, he doesn't want to use me, he wants me to enjoy him. He has been patient with me, and gentle. He says he will overthrow his wife and make me queen, though I know it cannot happen: she is too sharp, too cool, and calculating-she is a woman built to survive. I do not doubt that Agamemnon truly cared for me, but I will not return to him now. My heart no longer even belonged to Coroebus, my beloved Prince of Phrygia. He is dead and now I cared for no one.     I should have been content with this lot. At least when I was in Agamemnon's bed I could lose myself in pleasure for a little while. Other women were used every day by many Greeks the way I was during the fall of Troy. I heard their screams elsewhere on the ship.     When I last embraced my mother, parting on the once-Trojan shore, I held her tear-swollen face in my hands, and leveling my green eyes to her blue bloodshot ones, told her to be happy for me. Was I not the most fortunate of Trojan women? I was to be ""married"" to the King of Kings! He takes me with his lust and also shows me kindness. He seems to   care   what I think of him. Or did he merely want me to want him back so I would be a better lover?    The first night in his tent, I curled up like a baby when he touched me. I was still aching, still bleeding from the violation on Athena's altar. I feared he would do what many soldiers were doing to unwilling women: forcing them onto their hands and knees and taking them that way, rubbing their lovely faces into the dust so they won't scream. I watched the fighting from Troy's walls. I knew Agamemnon was a brutal man with a blood lust, but he never forced me-not that first night or the next. Of course, there is no consenting as a slave. All of it was rape.     I think he even feared me that night; what might I do to him if I were provoked? He knew what Ajax did to me during the city's fall; what I had already experienced. He knew that I was filled with wrath and rage. Would I slit his throat in his satisfied, post-coital sleep? Would I attempt to once again invoke Athena and Apollo's wrath upon him and all the Greeks? He didn't even look at me again until the next night, when I had become numb and lay still as he explored me, trying in vain to make me rise to him.     When I realized he wanted to pretend to make love to me, to hear what sounds I made in ecstasy, I allowed him to touch me. For those moments, as he drew out my climax, I could pretend that everyone I loved was still alive, my home was not a smoldering ruin, and that I was free. When he was done with me, I slept in a dreamless escape from this existence I could not call a life.     -    The ship bounced on a wave and I lost my balance, falling backward onto the deck rather than forward into the spitting sea. I clutched my side, knowing I would rise in the morning covered in bruises. I tried to stand up but was tangled in my soaked and water-heavy chiton.    ""Cassandra!"" Agamemnon shouted for me, running up the steps from the hold. I said nothing, and he repeated his cry, ""Cassandra!"" He was now by my side, brushing my arm with his fingertips, ""Are you all right?"" He didn't wait for an answer and picked me up as if I were a bundle of rags. I suppose he expected me to hold him around the neck as if I were drawn to him. I let my arms hang down.    He carefully carried me down the steps into the hold, nearly banging his head as he entered. We had our own small room there, where the stolen treasures of Troy surrounded a bed. I prayed he wouldn't lay me down on it and begin to undo the brooches on my dress, telling me something heart-wrenchingly silly: that I was more beautiful than Helen, that I was the greatest treasure amongst all the plunder of Troy. Because that's what I was: plunder. I was no longer a woman, I was a thing. I was relieved when he set me down and stood me on my feet.    He stood across from me but didn't look at my face. He looked below my chin, my neck, down to where the soaked white linen revealed the darknesses of my nipples beneath. I stared blankly at him; I began to shiver violently. My whole body quaked, and I wanted to shrink to the floor and be a coddled child again. I remained silent as he again ran his hands over the droplets on my arms, brushing tears of water to the wooden floor.    I remained silent as he undid the brooches of my chiton and tenderly wrapped me in a blanket and carried me to the bed. I thought of my once-great city which was now a smoking pile of ash. Mycenae would fall one day too.     I remained silent as Agamemnon removed all of his garments and unraveled the blanket to press the warmth of his skin against me. He would try once again to plant life inside me. There was no use in telling him that as soon as we saw land we would shortly all be dead. I had given up on trying to make people believe me.     What good had it done?     My father Priam was dead.    My brothers Hector, Deiphobus, Paris, Antiphus, Pammon, Hipponous, Polydorus, and Troilus are dead.    My sisters Creusa and Polyxena are dead.    My great love Coroebus is dead.    My mother Hecuba, my sister Laodice, my twin brother Helenus...all slaves now like me, headed for unknown shores. We were all once powerful in a powerful kingdom.     We were Trojan.    There is no Troy anymore. Apollo will watch me sleeping elsewhere. I will see the sun setting in fiery pinks and oranges over a different horizon.     Agamemnon moved his hands to spread my legs.     I would die, but I knew Troy would live on in the stories told by all who knew of the dream it once was. I had foreseen it.   Lift up, heave up, carry the flame!

I stood on the bow of the royal Mycenean ship, breathing in the salt of the sea as if I were the figurehead made flesh, watching the choppy waves disappear one by one beneath creaking wood. Fog was on the horizon, fog was behind us . . . but I knew that were Aeolus to sweep it away, my now-ashen birthplace would not appear. The western fortress, my final destination, was still obscured by distance. I could only see where the sky meets the sea. We were alone in the water, with no past or future landing in sight.    I was glad not to see a shore in the distance. The one I left was covered with a smoking ruin and the flailing bodies of wailing, ragged women. And I know the one I would land on held no happiness for me. I could already feel my captor's warm blood covering me, feeling the quick wind as the axe descends upon me, its next sacrifice. His wife will kill him from behind but will look me in the eyes when she rounded on me. He will die happily, moving inside me. His wife will have the audacity to be   jealous   of me, who will die while her husband rapes me once again. I have prophesied the raging madness in her stare.    I don't need the power of prophecy to know that I would fall ill if I remain where I am, but I far preferred being cold for a while than returning to him. Perhaps a wave might sweep me overboard and drag me under-but I knew how my life ended, and it would not be at sea. He wished to cover me in his heat, to make me warm to him, but I could not. As if as his slave I could possibly have any choice in loving him!

He carefully carried me down the steps into the hold, nearly banging his head as he entered. We had our own small room there, where the stolen treasures of Troy surrounded a bed. I prayed he wouldn't lay me down on it and begin to undo the brooches on my dress, telling me something heart-wrenchingly silly: that I was more beautiful than Helen, that I was the greatest treasure amongst all the plunder of Troy. Because that's what I was: plunder. I was no longer a woman, I was a thing. I was relieved when he set me down and stood me on my feet.    He stood across from me but didn't look at my face. He looked below my chin, my neck, down to where the soaked white linen revealed the darknesses of my nipples beneath. I stared blankly at him; I began to shiver violently. My whole body quaked, and I wanted to shrink to the floor and be a coddled child again. I remained silent as he again ran his hands over the droplets on my arms, brushing tears of water to the wooden floor.    I remained silent as he undid the brooches of my chiton and tenderly wrapped me in a blanket and carried me to the bed. I thought of my once-great city which was now a smoking pile of ash. Mycenae would fall one day too.     I remained silent as Agamemnon removed all of his garments and unraveled the blanket to press the warmth of his skin against me. He would try once again to plant life inside me. There was no use in telling him that as soon as we saw land we would shortly all be dead. I had given up on trying to make people believe me.     What good had it done?     My father Priam was dead.    My brothers Hector, Deiphobus, Paris, Antiphus, Pammon, Hipponous, Polydorus, and Troilus are dead.    My sisters Creusa and Polyxena are dead.    My great love Coroebus is dead.    My mother Hecuba, my sister Laodice, my twin brother Helenus...all slaves now like me, headed for unknown shores. We were all once powerful in a powerful kingdom.     We were Trojan.    There is no Troy anymore. Apollo will watch me sleeping elsewhere. I will see the sun setting in fiery pinks and oranges over a different horizon.     Agamemnon moved his hands to spread my legs.     I would die, but I knew Troy would live on in the stories told by all who knew of the dream it once was. I had foreseen it.   Lift up, heave up, carry the flame!

I stood on the bow of the royal Mycenean ship, breathing in the salt of the sea as if I were the figurehead made flesh, watching the choppy waves disappear one by one beneath creaking wood. Fog was on the horizon, fog was behind us . . . but I knew that were Aeolus to sweep it away, my now-ashen birthplace would not appear. The western fortress, my final destination, was still obscured by distance. I could only see where the sky meets the sea. We were alone in the water, with no past or future landing in sight.    I was glad not to see a shore in the distance. The one I left was covered with a smoking ruin and the flailing bodies of wailing, ragged women. And I know the one I would land on held no happiness for me. I could already feel my captor's warm blood covering me, feeling the quick wind as the axe descends upon me, its next sacrifice. His wife will kill him from behind but will look me in the eyes when she rounded on me. He will die happily, moving inside me. His wife will have the audacity to be   jealous   of me, who will die while her husband rapes me once again. I have prophesied the raging madness in her stare.    I don't need the power of prophecy to know that I would fall ill if I remain where I am, but I far preferred being cold for a while than returning to him. Perhaps a wave might sweep me overboard and drag me under-but I knew how my life ended, and it would not be at sea. He wished to cover me in his heat, to make me warm to him, but I could not. As if as his slave I could possibly have any choice in loving him! The best I could hope for is to be resigned, for my body and soul to stop fighting the reality that I was chattel, the spoils of war.     When I was free, I loved another, a man with whom I now regret never sharing all of myself. It was another mistake I made: a curse was put on my body as well as my tongue: should any man take me to his bed and take me fully, he would be killed not long after. I should have foreseen it...that my dear one would be slain during the city's fall regardless. Some had the good luck to die quickly, a sword to the neck or the heart. Instead, he died slowly watching me writhe in pain as a now-dead Greek ripped my virginity from my body, filling every orifice until I bled. I have already brought two men to their end, one innocent, one not, and I will again. I am She Who Entangles Men indeed.    I was born to be a queen. Troy was at its height then . . . before I became a priestess, I was raised to lie in the bed of a foreign king as his consort. That I have accomplished, but I was destined to be a queen, not a slave. Agamemnon, King of Kings, rests on linens below deck, likely lying awake and anticipating my return. I will make him wait. My body will be his for the remainder of his life.    Of thousands of women, he picked me, the one who didn't know how to pleasure him. And yet, he doesn't want to use me, he wants me to enjoy him. He has been patient with me, and gentle. He says he will overthrow his wife and make me queen, though I know it cannot happen: she is too sharp, too cool, and calculating-she is a woman built to survive. I do not doubt that Agamemnon truly cared for me, but I will not return to him now. My heart no longer even belonged to Coroebus, my beloved Prince of Phrygia. He is dead and now I cared for no one.     I should have been content with this lot. At least when I was in Agamemnon's bed I could lose myself in pleasure for a little while. Other women were used every day by many Greeks the way I was during the fall of Troy. I heard their screams elsewhere on the ship.     When I last embraced my mother, parting on the once-Trojan shore, I held her tear-swollen face in my hands, and leveling my green eyes to her blue bloodshot ones, told her to be happy for me. Was I not the most fortunate of Trojan women? I was to be ""married"" to the King of Kings! He takes me with his lust and also shows me kindness. He seems to   care   what I think of him. Or did he merely want me to want him back so I would be a better lover?    The first night in his tent, I curled up like a baby when he touched me. I was still aching, still bleeding from the violation on Athena's altar. I feared he would do what many soldiers were doing to unwilling women: forcing them onto their hands and knees and taking them that way, rubbing their lovely faces into the dust so they won't scream. I watched the fighting from Troy's walls. I knew Agamemnon was a brutal man with a blood lust, but he never forced me-not that first night or the next. Of course, there is no consenting as a slave. All of it was rape.     I think he even feared me that night; what might I do to him if I were provoked? He knew what Ajax did to me during the city's fall; what I had already experienced. He knew that I was filled with wrath and rage. Would I slit his throat in his satisfied, post-coital sleep? Would I attempt to once again invoke Athena and Apollo's wrath upon him and all the Greeks? He didn't even look at me again until the next night, when I had become numb and lay still as he explored me, trying in vain to make me rise to him.     When I realized he wanted to pretend to make love to me, to hear what sounds I made in ecstasy, I allowed him to touch me. For those moments, as he drew out my climax, I could pretend that everyone I loved was still alive, my home was not a smoldering ruin, and that I was free. When he was done with me, I slept in a dreamless escape from this existence I could not call a life.     -    The ship bounced on a wave and I lost my balance, falling backward onto the deck rather than forward into the spitting sea. I clutched my side, knowing I would rise in the morning covered in bruises. I tried to stand up but was tangled in my soaked and water-heavy chiton.    ""Cassandra!"" Agamemnon shouted for me, running up the steps from the hold. I said nothing, and he repeated his cry, ""Cassandra!"" He was now by my side, brushing my arm with his fingertips, ""Are you all right?"" He didn't wait for an answer and picked me up as if I were a bundle of rags.

The best I could hope for is to be resigned, for my body and soul to stop fighting the reality that I was chattel, the spoils of war.     When I was free, I loved another, a man with whom I now regret never sharing all of myself. It was another mistake I made: a curse was put on my body as well as my tongue: should any man take me to his bed and take me fully, he would be killed not long after. I should have foreseen it...that my dear one would be slain during the city's fall regardless. Some had the good luck to die quickly, a sword to the neck or the heart. Instead, he died slowly watching me writhe in pain as a now-dead Greek ripped my virginity from my body, filling every orifice until I bled. I have already brought two men to their end, one innocent, one not, and I will again. I am She Who Entangles Men indeed.    I was born to be a queen. Troy was at its height then . . . before I became a priestess, I was raised to lie in the bed of a foreign king as his consort. That I have accomplished, but I was destined to be a queen, not a slave. Agamemnon, King of Kings, rests on linens below deck, likely lying awake and anticipating my return. I will make him wait. My body will be his for the remainder of his life.    Of thousands of women, he picked me, the one who didn't know how to pleasure him. And yet, he doesn't want to use me, he wants me to enjoy him. He has been patient with me, and gentle. He says he will overthrow his wife and make me queen, though I know it cannot happen: she is too sharp, too cool, and calculating-she is a woman built to survive. I do not doubt that Agamemnon truly cared for me, but I will not return to him now. My heart no longer even belonged to Coroebus, my beloved Prince of Phrygia. He is dead and now I cared for no one.     I should have been content with this lot. At least when I was in Agamemnon's bed I could lose myself in pleasure for a little while. Other women were used every day by many Greeks the way I was during the fall of Troy. I heard their screams elsewhere on the ship.     When I last embraced my mother, parting on the once-Trojan shore, I held her tear-swollen face in my hands, and leveling my green eyes to her blue bloodshot ones, told her to be happy for me. Was I not the most fortunate of Trojan women? I was to be ""married"" to the King of Kings! He takes me with his lust and also shows me kindness. He seems to   care   what I think of him. Or did he merely want me to want him back so I would be a better lover?    The first night in his tent, I curled up like a baby when he touched me. I was still aching, still bleeding from the violation on Athena's altar. I feared he would do what many soldiers were doing to unwilling women: forcing them onto their hands and knees and taking them that way, rubbing their lovely faces into the dust so they won't scream. I watched the fighting from Troy's walls. I knew Agamemnon was a brutal man with a blood lust, but he never forced me-not that first night or the next. Of course, there is no consenting as a slave. All of it was rape.     I think he even feared me that night; what might I do to him if I were provoked? He knew what Ajax did to me during the city's fall; what I had already experienced. He knew that I was filled with wrath and rage. Would I slit his throat in his satisfied, post-coital sleep? Would I attempt to once again invoke Athena and Apollo's wrath upon him and all the Greeks? He didn't even look at me again until the next night, when I had become numb and lay still as he explored me, trying in vain to make me rise to him.     When I realized he wanted to pretend to make love to me, to hear what sounds I made in ecstasy, I allowed him to touch me. For those moments, as he drew out my climax, I could pretend that everyone I loved was still alive, my home was not a smoldering ruin, and that I was free. When he was done with me, I slept in a dreamless escape from this existence I could not call a life.     -    The ship bounced on a wave and I lost my balance, falling backward onto the deck rather than forward into the spitting sea. I clutched my side, knowing I would rise in the morning covered in bruises. I tried to stand up but was tangled in my soaked and water-heavy chiton.    ""Cassandra!"" Agamemnon shouted for me, running up the steps from the hold. I said nothing, and he repeated his cry, ""Cassandra!"" He was now by my side, brushing my arm with his fingertips, ""Are you all right?"" He didn't wait for an answer and picked me up as if I were a bundle of rags. I suppose he expected me to hold him around the neck as if I were drawn to him. I let my arms hang down.    He carefully carried me down the steps into the hold, nearly banging his head as he entered. We had our own small room there, where the stolen treasures of Troy surrounded a bed. I prayed he wouldn't lay me down on it and begin to undo the brooches on my dress, telling me something heart-wrenchingly silly: that I was more beautiful than Helen, that I was the greatest treasure amongst all the plunder of Troy. Because that's what I was: plunder. I was no longer a woman, I was a thing. I was relieved when he set me down and stood me on my feet.    He stood across from me but didn't look at my face. He looked below my chin, my neck, down to where the soaked white linen revealed the darknesses of my nipples beneath. I stared blankly at him; I began to shiver violently. My whole body quaked, and I wanted to shrink to the floor and be a coddled child again. I remained silent as he again ran his hands over the droplets on my arms, brushing tears of water to the wooden floor.    I remained silent as he undid the brooches of my chiton and tenderly wrapped me in a blanket and carried me to the bed. I thought of my once-great city which was now a smoking pile of ash. Mycenae would fall one day too.     I remained silent as Agamemnon removed all of his garments and unraveled the blanket to press the warmth of his skin against me. He would try once again to plant life inside me. There was no use in telling him that as soon as we saw land we would shortly all be dead. I had given up on trying to make people believe me.     What good had it done?     My father Priam was dead.    My brothers Hector, Deiphobus, Paris, Antiphus, Pammon, Hipponous, Polydorus, and Troilus are dead.    My sisters Creusa and Polyxena are dead.    My great love Coroebus is dead.    My mother Hecuba, my sister Laodice, my twin brother Helenus...all slaves now like me, headed for unknown shores. We were all once powerful in a powerful kingdom.     We were Trojan.    There is no Troy anymore. Apollo will watch me sleeping elsewhere. I will see the sun setting in fiery pinks and oranges over a different horizon.     Agamemnon moved his hands to spread my legs.     I would die, but I knew Troy would live on in the stories told by all who knew of the dream it once was. I had foreseen it.   Lift up, heave up, carry the flame!

I stood on the bow of the royal Mycenean ship, breathing in the salt of the sea as if I were the figurehead made flesh, watching the choppy waves disappear one by one beneath creaking wood. Fog was on the horizon, fog was behind us . . . but I knew that were Aeolus to sweep it away, my now-ashen birthplace would not appear. The western fortress, my final destination, was still obscured by distance. I could only see where the sky meets the sea. We were alone in the water, with no past or future landing in sight.    I was glad not to see a shore in the distance. The one I left was covered with a smoking ruin and the flailing bodies of wailing, ragged women. And I know the one I would land on held no happiness for me. I could already feel my captor's warm blood covering me, feeling the quick wind as the axe descends upon me, its next sacrifice. His wife will kill him from behind but will look me in the eyes when she rounded on me. He will die happily, moving inside me. His wife will have the audacity to be   jealous   of me, who will die while her husband rapes me once again. I have prophesied the raging madness in her stare.    I don't need the power of prophecy to know that I would fall ill if I remain where I am, but I far preferred being cold for a while than returning to him. Perhaps a wave might sweep me overboard and drag me under-but I knew how my life ended, and it would not be at sea. He wished to cover me in his heat, to make me warm to him, but I could not.

Her last moments flashed through her mind, mixed in with betrayal and grief. Slowly, she crumpled to her knees. The woman waited while she sobbed.  Some hour or days hence, when she'd cried her eyes dry, she uncurled herself and peered up at the woman, still patiently waiting. Iphigenia took stock of the endless fields--the air as silent as the skies had been at Aulis--and the woman at her side. Iphigenia got the impression of a serene, regal woman, though she couldn't seem to focus on her face.  ""The Fields of Asphodel,"" Iphigenia guessed hollowly. Her small voice dissipated in the air, and the woman nodded. ""This wasn't how it was su--supposed to. . . ."" She hiccupped, the tears beginning again.  The woman's lips pressed together sternly. ""No, it wasn't,"" she said, her voice disapproving. ""The Pantheon does not see eye-to-eye on most days, and the. . . disagreement over your sacrifice was especially bitter. Which is why we have come to see you.""  ""We?""  The woman gave an elegant wave, and threw figures appeared behind her. ""I am the Queen of the Underworld, and I have summoned the Fates. Perhaps we can rewrite your tale.""  The first figure stepped forward, holding a glowing spindle in her hands. ""I can re-spin the circumstances of your birth,"" Clotho offered. ""By altering your past, no longer will you be the daughter of Agamemnon, a princess of the Greeks. In your new life, you will be the daughter of a smith. You will lead a quiet, comfortable life.""  As she spoke, she drew out the thread between her fingers, and the scene materialized directly in Iphigenia's mind: a roaring fire in the hearth, a crowded table, faceless figures that she knew would be her family. Though the scene was a happy one, bitterness tugged at her heart. Instead of that comfortable warmth, her own father had lodged a dagger in her throat.  ""What will become of my family? My old family,"" she clarified. ""Who would have been sacrificed?""  She knew the answer as soon as the words left her mouth. ""Your sister Electra,"" the figure answered.  Iphigenia blanched. She immediately, forcefully shook her head. ""Though your offer is a beautiful one, I cannot accept,"" she murmured.  Clotho nodded and melted back into the shadows, and the second figure emerged, a single shining thread pinched between her fingers. ""Then I shall create for you a different present,"" Lachesis suggested. ""I will draw out the thread of your life, extend it past its bloody end. Tomorrow, the Myrmidons will wake with no memory of today. You will be married to Achilles, best of the Greeks, as you were told. Your marriage will be the event of your generation. Your arms and hair will be adorned with gold and jewels, on your wedding day and every day after. Achilles will treat you with kindness and dignity, and you shall want for nothing.""  This time, a new scene materialized in her mind's eye. A golden wedding to a golden husband, a glittering palace to call her own. . . and then, the scene shifted. A thousand ships stranded on the shores of Aulis, a miserable and disgraceful march home. Iphigenia saw her mother and siblings ripped from their rooms and tossed in the streets, and a new king sitting upon her father's throne.  When the vision was over, she touched the tear tracks on her face. ""What was that?"" she whispered.  There was neither sympathy nor cruelty in Lachesis's unfeeling gaze. ""Without the sacrifice, your father's army can't sail for Troy,"" she explained. ""The people have put much into the war--in footsoldiers to fill the armies, and in material provisions. The other kings are quick to blame Agamemnon, and his favor with his people is worn thin.""  ""And my siblings? Electra, barely learning to walk, and Orestes, still a baby in Mother's arms. . . ."" Iphigenia bowed her head. She did not need to be told how a usurper king treated his predecessor's children. Electra would be made a serving girl, and later a mistress. Orestes would be ruthlessly killed, lest he one day seek revenge.  ""Thank you, but I must refuse your offer,"" she murmured, and the Lachesis inclined her head before fading away.  The queen Persephone took her place. ""Then, are you content with your life as it played out, Child?"" she asked. As she spoke, she waved her arms and conjured images of the near-present and the future. Together, they watched as the ships landed upon Trojan shores. Years of war, a generation of plague, bloodshed, and death. Then, a swift return as Agamemnon and Menelaus, the triumphant brother-kings, returned to their lands and were hailed as heroes. A long, prosperous reign before Agamemnon abdicated, and Orestes ascended as the new king. In their old age, Clytemnestra forgave Agamemnon, and at long last, he died quietly in his sleep.  All this, they watched in silence, and when the last images faded away, Iphigenia stood still, trancelike, gazing at where the visions had been.  ""No,"" she said at last.  ""No?""  Iphigenia cleared her throat, tears starting again. ""No,"" she repeated. ""I want that future for my siblings. . . for my Mother. . . but I'm angry. Furious, even! I died like a--a slaughter cow upon a slab! And I'm. . . I'm not happy to serve everyone. I should be proud. . . I should be honored. . . but I'm not. Not like this."" She hung her head. ""I guess I'm still a child after all,"" she sighed.  Persephone listened to the outburst, and then she seemed to smile. She glanced to the side, and the third figure stepped forward.  Dark shadows surrounded the last, stooped figure. ""I offer you revenge,"" Atropos said mildly, experimentally snipping with her golden shears. ""I cannot cut without a thread, and I cannot spin you another life, but of those that remain. . . ."" She grinned, a sly thing with too many teeth. ""I can send a whisper of intent into a ready mind,"" she said.  Iphigenia shivered as the images snaked through her mind: Aegisthus, a willing fool, grown too ambitious, wielding an axe placed there by Clytemnestra's hand. Her father cowering in the bath.  She closed her eyes and waited, waited for the horror to arrive. But instead of pain or remorse, something else was settling deep in her chest, something warm and filling as hot stew. Satisfaction, she realized.  She stood up straight and looked Atropos in her endless, bottomless eyes. ""Do it,"" she said.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;semantic

Well, one day Zeus (the cheater himself) fell in love with a woman named Alcmene and decided, ""Hey, I'd love to get in her pants"" but she was already married to Amphitryon which made Zeus second guess cause he'd never cheat with a married woman (cue hera screaming in the distance), but then Zeus being Zeus decided to just shape shift into her husband and do the deed with her that way, so he bribed the sun god (either Helios or Apollo I've seen versions that say either) to make the night last for an abnormally long time so he could get away with his plan.  Amphitryon came home the next morning, much to the confusion of of Alcmene (they figured out it was Zeus, I forget how but they do). Then fast forward 9 months and Alcmene had to twins, but only one was a demi-god (somehow), Iphicles and some name I can't remember (it gets changed so it doesn't matter). But the fact that one was a child of Zeus made Alcmene nervous that she and or her child who get smite by Hera, so what did she do? Abandon her new born child in a field obviously. But Zeus (Or Athena, depending on what version you read) took him to Hera, and was like, ""Hey I found some random child in a field whos name is....uh, Heracles! You know, meaning glory to Hera! haha"". So Hera decided to nurse him out of pity, (suck up lol). But Heracles apparently bit her so she pushed him away and accidently created the milky way.  Hera's goddess milk made him a buff baby then Zeus was like, ""Lol, ok bye, I totally won't cheat on you again"" and brought Heracles back to his mother (You know, the one that abandoned him in a field). But they decided to not abandon him in a field this time and instead raise him, but Hera then realized he was a child of one of her husbands many many many (times like 100) affairs so she decided to try and kill him with 2 random snakes she sent after him but because Heracles was now a buff baby he snapped both there necks and strangled them.  *time skip to when he's no longer a buff baby but a buff teenager/man*  Heracles ended up growing up a pretty normal child, (Unless you count that one time he murdered his music teacher on accident) and married Megara the princess of Thebes (After stopping Thebes from being attacked) until Hera decided ""You know, I haven't been tried to kill or ruin that kids life in a long time, I think it's about time I did that"" and drove him insane causing him to....murder his wife and children with his superhuman strength in a fit of rage...(Like, Hera we know you hate him but that was a bit much).  Then when Hera's inanity magic wore off Heracles freaked out and went to ask the oracle of Delphi how he could make up for his actions, (tbh, I think you're the one who deserved an apology my dude, Zeus and Hera need some serious marriage consoling). The oracle told him to go do what ever 10 things his cousin asked of him for 12 years, then they'd make him a god, (Hera - It was at this moment that she knew, she fucked up). So he traveled to visit Eurystheus (that's his cousin btw), though he didn't want to help his cousin he also wasn't inserted in getting smited by his dad so he went along with it. (Btw, his cousin is on Hera's side during all this cause he too was  p e t t y )  So his asshole cousin was like, ""Hey dude, so you now how you're for some reason in-debt to me cause you commited some homicide? Well I want you to go slay the Neiman lion because of it"" (he didn't think he'd pull it off). So Heracles went to find and fight the Neiman lion so he could bring it's corpse to his weird ass cousin who diffidently wants him dead. (Also he met this boy who was like, ""You kill that lion and we'll sacrifice one to Zeus but if you die or chicken out, I get sacrificed to Zeus!"" so ig some random town sacrificed a lion to Zeus then). When he found the lion and realized he couldn't shoot it cause it was immune to all weapons he made a plan and strangled it while it slept pretty much. Then returned to his cousin with the dead lion to be assigned his next task.  This feat made Heracles even more popular and his cousin more jealous (again, petty bitch). So for his next task his cousin told him to kill the Hyrda, so Heracles hopped a ride with this nephew Iolas (I assume on the godly side cause none of them can keep it in there pants) to go to the swamp where the Hyrda lived and kill the it. He figured out that if you cut off one of the Hyrda's head it would simply re-grow (also I think he got attacked by some crab mid fight which is just, random af) it so Iolas helped him make a plan where they would cut of all it's heads then burn the necks so more heads wouldn't grow back and used it's poison blood to make poisons arrows (that'll be important later). But when he returned to his cousin (the petty one), he refused to count this task as one of his 10 labors cause he had helps from Iolas (like I said, petty bitch) so now he had to do 11 labors to make up for this one not counting.  The next thing he got forced into doing (this was Hera's idea btw) was capturing this magic deer called the ceryneian hind but it was really hard to catch cause it could run super fast, and he couldn't shoot it because it was again, hella fast. So, he just chased it around for a year but one night he found it sleeping and captured it (versions may very). His cousin was hoping Heracles doing this would piss of Artemis cause he captured her sacred animal and there for would smite him or something, and when Heracles was bringing the hind to his petty cousin Artemis (and in some versions Apollo) showed up to give him a what for, (you can hear Hera and Eurystheus laughing in the distance) but after Heracles explained the situation Artemis aloud him to take it as long as he set it after, but his cousin made him give it to some king so he gave it to the king outside and the deer just ran away, once again fouling his idiot cousins plans.  After that fiasco his cousin sent him to go deal with this murder boar and was causing a lot of problems for people. So on his way to do that he had dinner with this centaur who's name I can't remember rn and was like, ""Hey, so wanna share some wine?"" to which the centaur was like, ""Well...the only wine I have was a gift from Dionysus and doesn't just belong to me but sure ig"" but then all the other centaurs showed up, got drunk and well....  *One large account of unnecessary centaur murder later*  The only one he spared was the centaur he had dinner with but then the centaur dropped a poison arrow on his foot and died (skill issue lol). Heracles then visited Chiron (some versions say he got shot too) who told him how to catch the angry death boar. He was told to shove the boar into thick snow so Heracles did, then returned to his asshole cousin with the boar. The next thing his cousin sent him to do was clean the augean stables in one day (they hadn't been cleaned in over 30 years and 1,000's of animals lived there btw). He managed to clean the stables by seducing a nyad (water nymph) and diverting the river to wash they stables clean, (which like, way to poison and entire ecosystem cause you happened to be horny and needed to clean some shit). After that he asked to be paid by the stable owner who refused but bitchy mcbitch face (his cousin) decided to use this as a way to make the labor not count meaning he had to do another to make up for it bringing his number of labors to 12.  After that his cousin decided to task him with several counts of harassing random wildlife which included, stymphalian birds, a very pissed off creatan bull and a bunch of flesh eating horses, the mares of Diomedes. Then in-between his 8th and 9th labor he did some more cool stuff like, murder another centaur, invent the olympics, fight some giants, sailed around on the argo with Jason and rescue Prometheus from the eagle that was constantly eating his liver. You know, all very chill stuff, (you can imagine all this pissed of Hera and Eurystheus weren't very happy about this). So, due to Hera and Eurystheus being extra pissed off after all that they sent him to steal a belt from a bunch of super badass female warriors (the amazons). (Also some people think Theseus was here for all this) He ended up just talking to them and getting the belt though so Hera felt the need to intervene by shapeshifting into one of the amazons, (And we say holding grudges is a fatal flaw associated with hades?!) and was like, ""Hey, my husbands bastard child is here to kidnap the queen of the amazons we should totally kill him"", then.....  *One very unnecessary massacre of some super badass warriors later (Thanks a lot Hera)*  He then returned to his cousin and got send on his 10th labor to collect the cattle of geryon, (why he wanted them idk). On the way there though he got pissed off about heat stroke and attempted to fight the sun and shot an arrow at it. This prompted (either Helios or Apollo take your pick) to come deal with the situation and was impressed by Heracles sheer audacity and gifted him a magic cup that he could ride in to make his journey easier, (Hear that kids? Shoot the sun and you'll get a magic cup out of it). So when he go to the island with the cows he fought a three bodied giant, a son of ares (I think) and a 2 headed dog. Then he shoved all the cows into his magic cup from the sun god but on the way back one got loose so Heracles had to fight some dude names Eryx to get the cow back. After that Hera, being the petty bitch she is somehow scared all the cows away with a fly, (I didn't know cows where scared of flies). So after Heracles rounded them all up he finally made it back to his cousin just so he could kill them all in honor of Hera.  Then with his first 10 tasks complete he had to complete 2 extras because his cousins and asshole. So, he got sent to go collect a golden apple from the hesperides tree. So he went to capture some shapeshifting sea god to reveal the location of the tree to him then according to some versions of the myth he suspended a child of Gaia in the sky and hugged him to death (Also he almost got sacrificed in Egypt by some king). But Heracles didn't want to do this labor himself (somehow it still counted though??? I think his douchebag cousin was just getting lazy tbh) so he went a tricked the titan Atlas into collecting the apples for him while he held up the sky in Atlas's place. When Atlas came back with the apples and offered to take them back himself Heracles said he needed to adjust his outfit and convinced Atlas to take back the sky (the flipping idiot).  And finally, for his 12th and final labor his cousin sent him to retrieve Cerberus from the underworld (Pretty blunt about trying to get him killed my dude) so Heracles traveled to the underworld and found 2 people with there asses glued to rocks for all eternity (pretty sure it was for trying to kidnap Persephone but I don't remember) and freed one of them before getting scared off by a mini earthquake and made his way to Hades to ask permission to take his dog, (Fun fact, Cerberus pretty much translate to Spot so Hades, god of the underworld named his dog spot <3). Hades agreed as long as Heracles returned him unharmed, (and people think Hades is a villain, smh) so Heracles took Cerberus to his cousin who finally announced he was redeemed of his sins and gave up trying to kill him. So, finally redeemed for the murder of his family he fought a river god and married a princess named Deinaeria and he was happy for a while. That is until a centaur Nesso's kidnapped his wife and tried to marry her, so Heracles shot him with an arrow and as he bled out he convinced Deinareria to take some of his blood and if Heracles was ever on faithful to her it would act as a love potion, (spoiler alert - it was poison). Then later Deinareria noticed Heracles was flirting with someone named Iole (Dude, your married you keep it in your pants unless it's with your wife please, you almost got murdered multiple times because your dad cheated after all). So, when she was doing laundry she rubbed the centaurs blood onto Heracles clothing, which inevitably poisoned him so what did he do? That's right, he set himself on fire. But Zeus saved him and offered him immortality (hera wasn't too happy about that) which he accepted. Then he married, Hebe the goddess of eternal youth and that's pretty much that for Heracles.  - The End   The myth of Orpheus and Eurydice  So, Orpheus was a child of the muse Calliope ( my phone keeps wanting to call her cantaloupe) and Apollo (I think some versions say it was some king too but idk I remember him being a child of Apollo), and because his dad was Apollo and his mom was the muse of poetry my dudes was a pretty sweet musician (for my fellow pjo fans, basically charm speak but with a lyre). He lived in Thrace and basically impressed everyone with his music. He was so good at music that he ended up part of the argonauts with Jason on his journey for some sick new drip (I'll probably talk about him more in his own myth later). Also he chilled in Egypt and learned about Dionysus cult worship for a while (well that's just ironic...)  Orpheus fell in love with Eurydice and married her but this dude at there wedding (the literal god of marriage Hymen, not to be confused with the goddess of marriage Hera...yeah not that bitch) was like, ""so yeah this happy marriage isn't gonna last very long my dudes"" and safe to say his was right. Euphoria was walking with her nymph friends in the forest and i guess no one taught her that rhyme ""red on black friend of Jack, black on yellow you're a dead fellow"" because boom, snake bite and she was dead.  So, Orpheus was obviously crushed by this loss and decided to go all emo and write super angsty music and stuff, but cause his music was magical and all that he started making everyone depressed so Apollo came to him and was like, ""dude you gotta stop making everyone sad, go return your wife from the underworld or something but please stop making everyone depressed and angsty with you"", so Orpheus traveled to the underworld to retrieve his wifey from the dead.  He went before Hades and Persephone (so this happened in winter or fall) and started playing his angsty emo music for them instead and it was so powerful it made everyone in the underworld sob, so Hades agreed to let Eurydice to travel back to the lane of the living with Orpheus but with the deal that Orpheus couldn't turn around to look at Eurydice until they were both out of the underground. Orpheus would have to lead Eurydice with his music but if Orpheus ever turned around to see Eurydice before they were in the mortal world she would be forced to return to the underworld.  They managed to make it all the way to the entrance when Orpheus feared he was being tricked by hades (hear that folks, Hades is a villain propaganda lost him his wife) and turned around only for his wife to be sent back to the underworld. After loosing his wife for a second time and returning to being angsty he decided to swear off relationships with woman and instead turned to pedophilia directed at young boys.....  Then, when he was having an angsty concert for the forest creatures bashing all the gods a bunch of Dionysus cult followers showed and ripped him limb from limb for not worshipping Dionysus (again, the irony). In death he was finally reunited with his dearly beloved Eurydice (imagine him having to explain his angsty pedophilia faze...that would definitely be awkward af). And his lyre became a constellation at one point too.   The myth of Hades and Persephone  So, I'm sure many people think of this story and go ""Oh HaDeS iS a BaD gUy! He KiDnApPeD hIs wIfE!""AND YEAH, HE DID KIDNAP HIS WIFE BUT JUST TAKE A SEAT AND CHILL PLEASE BECAUSE I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS HADES SLANDER!!! (Even if it's a bit deserved ;-;)  Anyways, Hades, god of the dead (Yes, the dead. Not death. The god of death is Thanatos, there's a difference.), was one of the big three brothers who helped defeat the titans.  Hades ruled the underworld and one day, he saw a very pretty goddess, Demeter's daughter, Persephone (In some versions she's called Kore, which means maiden. Side note, in the version I was told as a kid, he fell in love with her because she was the only one who wasn't afraid of Cerberus, which is just so adorable to me <3), and our bro started simping for her.  So, he went to Zeus (Persephone's father mind you) and was like, ""I wanna marry her, but I have social anxiety and don't know how to talk to hot people so wtf do I do?!"" to which Zeus, after thinking long and hard (note my sarcasm) was like, ""Uh, just kidnap her....that normally works for me"" (Also, in some versions Zeus arranged there marriage in the first place)  So, when Persephone (Or Kore, take your pick) was out picking flowers, Hades rode out from the underworld on his chariot and kidnapped her after she wandered off on her own (versions may very). But Demeter noticed her absence and was (rightfully) concerned for her daughter and went to the sun god Helios (the version I know, it was Helios so we're going with that for now, if you want you can say it's apollo) and Helios was like, ""Oh her? Yeah, Hades kidnapped her-"" (Cue distressed screaming from demeter)  Upon finding out her daughter was, you know, kidnapped she rightfully freaked out and Helios was like, ""Hey, Hades isn't the worst person to be stuck with, he's actually pretty cool, blah blah blah, misogyny is cool, blah blah-"" (Cue more angry Demeter noises)  (SIDE NOTE, Misogyny is most diffidently NOT COOL BROS! Ancient Greece was not very good to women, and the stories and myths of the time reflect that as a whole, I try to keep things light hearted but some myths, such as Medusa, have heavy themes of this or these themes still slip through. Ancient Greece was pretty fucked up so just know I try my best but the stories are still gonna reflect the time period in some aspects)  -Back to our scheduled programming-  Once Demeter had calmed down from her fit of rage (Justified rage to be fair), she decided her best course of action to fill the Persephone shaped hole in her heart was.....to dress up as an old lady named Doso and become a baby sitter for this kid, Demophoon (I imagine this kid has a fair helping of childhood trauma after this lol). But along with all the normally babysitter duties she also.... planned to make him immortal so she coated him in ambrosia, breathed on him and set him on her boobs and put him to bed in a fire at night to burn away his mortal spirit....(Someone's been hanging out with Hera a little to much lol). All without his parents knowing. But, one night when she put the baby to sleep in a fire (This kid and Leo Valdez can trauma bond over this lol) his mother walked in and rightfully...freaked out, interrupting the ritual and, in some versions, killing Demophoon. Though in others he survives his night in the fire, but dies later due to the weird half immortality thing he's got going on after this whole ordeal. (She also taught Demophoon's older brother to be a farmer after this and apparently my dude travels on a dragon-drawn chariot....so...)  But after the mothers freak out, Demeter gets upset and reveals herself to be a goddess and told Demophoon's parents, the only way she'd forgive them was if they built her a temple (I'd be so confused if I was the parents in this situation).  So, the parents built her a temple and Demeter chilled there instead of Olympus and became so depressed she forgot to make plants grow and caused this huge drought/famine.  And the rest of the gods started noting and where like, ""So, what the fuck is up with Demeter and why are we not getting sacrifices from the mortals anymore??""  So all the gods went to Demeter's little depression nest and tried to coax her back to Olympus or at the very least, get her to stop letting all the plants die, and they all failed. So Hermes decided to go knocking on Hades door to get some answer on Persephone and hopefully convince her to return to the mortal world so Demeter would stop being an angsty little bitch and killing all the mortals.  Persephone agreed to return with Hermes but before she left she ate 6 pomegranate seeds (In some versions I think they say it was 12 but I remember it as 6), and when she returned Demeter was finally happy again and decided she wasn't going to slowly end humanity with a lack of plants. However, because she ate the pomegranate seeds she had to stay in the underworld but Demeter and Hades got into an argument which I imagine went a little something like this,  ""If you eat food in the underworld you have to stay there!""  ""Oh really? Then how are you here?!""  *Cue awkward pause*  ""I don't count, but she ate 6 pomegranate seeds so she has to stay in the underworld with me!""  ""Well, she only had 6 seeds! Not a whole pomegranate so surely she can stay with me instead!""  *Lots of godly screaming, meanwhile Persephone and Hermes are just watching*  Hermes - ""So you see that race last weekended? It was pretty cool""  Persephone - ""Ah, no I missed it....was sort of kidnapped by my husband remember?""  ""Oh yeah, that sucks...""  ""Meh, he's got a dog though, I like dogs""  But anyways, they decided to take the matter to Zeus (Why him I'm not sure, like I know he's the king of the gods and all but...I feel like it would have made more sense for Athena to handle this one but maybe that's just me) who eventually decided that because she only ate 6 seeds, she only had to spend 6 months in the underworld. But, Demeter swore that she wouldn't let plants grow without Persephone being with her.  So now, 6 months of the year Demeter gets seasonal depression and stops making plants grow while Persephone vibes with a dog, her husband and a bunch of dead dudes for 6 months.  - The End   The myth of Pandora's box  Hey there! Remember what I said in the Hades and Persephone chapter about misogyny in ancient greece? Yeah, this might have a bit of that peaking through in parts so just, fair warning folks!  So, Pandora's box can basically be summed up as a myth explaining how people happened (least, according to the ancient greeks). Also, this and Hades and Persephone where the first greek myths I ever heard so I kinda have a soft spot for them lol.  But anyways, if we wanna start with how people happened (again, according to the ancient greeks) there were many trials and errors with creating people. When the tians where around, they created people which where actually not to bad or creepy (I will touch on the whole soulmate thing briefly here but I'll probably dedicate a chapter to it too if I'm up for it). But when Zeus took over (I'll go a chapter on the titan war at some point too) I guess he destroyed those people or something cause I can't find much about what happened to them (Then again, not entirely sure what I should be looking for in that regard so take this with a grain of salt).  The titan Prometheus (Some versions say he was a god I think? Idk, were just going with titan) could see the future, so before the whole titan war he and his brother, Epimetheus (he'll be important later), went into hiding so they didn't have to deal with it all. So when Zeus took over he created his own human race, though they sort of just stayed babies for a 100 years then died. So, he started over with a different batch of human which stayed babies for a lot less time that his first versions.  But, these humans where violent towards each other so Zeus refused to give them fire. But Prometheus gave them fire anyways, until Zeus found out he chained him to a rock and had an eagle eat his liver everyday for eternity until Heracles helped him out with it. But Zeus still wanted to punish people for having fire so he had Hephaestus create a woman named Pandora to be there punishment. (Again, misogyny is not cool folks!). The gods gifted her a dress, flowers for her hair, golden jewelry etc.  And, this is the part where the myth gets kinda fuzzy, in the kids book I had Pandora was given her box and then later her daughter was the one to open it but I don't think that version is very authentic considering it was a Max and Ruby picture book for kids so while it was the version I grew up with, I don't think it's the most accurate to the original myths.  But in some versions on the myth that I've heard she was given her box (Which was actually a storage jar in the original myths, but got changed to box threw translation errors) as one of her gifts from the gods. Prometheus (Remember him? yeah, well he can still see the future) told his brother that Zeus was going to try and arrange a marriage between Epimetheus and Pandora and then Pandora was going to unleash all her plagues and bad stuff out of the jar to screw over the entirety of humanity and that he probably shouldn't do marry her. But Epimetheus married her anyways and just like Prometheus had said she opened her box/jar and released all the evil stuff into the world (Except for hope, which I'm pretty sure stayed in the jar).  In other versions, Zeus left the jar/box in the care of Epimetheus (I think anyways) and Pandora grew curious and opened the box accidently releasing all the evil shit into the world but quickly closed it upon realizing what she did, leaving hope trapped in the jar. (Funnily enough, this isn't the first time opening jars or urns have been said to releasing bad stuff in greek myth, there's also references to it in the Iliad).  So now the mortals had to deal with sickness and famines and stuff, so Zeus decided ""Fuck it"" and started making a flood to whip them all out (I swear, gods all throughout different mythology and religions always resort to 'when in doubt, drown humanity', like this shows up so many times through old religions and mythologies I swear. Like, who started that? Who was the first god/goddess to drown humanity??).  But anyways, Prometheus keeps providing exposition to people despite his lack of a liver, so he goes to his son Deucalion and tells him Zeus is having his ""when in doubt, drown humanity"" moment so he should probably act accordingly and unlike Epimetheus, Deucalion actually decided to act accordingly by shoving himself and his wife, Pyrrha into a box so they could just vibes through Zeus's rain of terror (Literal rain of terror in this case).  So after basically vibing through Zeus's apocalypse it was sort up to them to re-populate the earth but instead of doing it the natural way they took the easy and lest incent-y (Big shocker there considering it's Greek Mythology) way to do so and just tossed some rocks around which Zeus turned into people. And this was finally the human race that stuck and didn't get wiped out (I mean, if 2020 is anything to go by there's been attempts to do so but we're, somehow, still standing!).  - The End ";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;1;0;semantic

The villagers went to the temple only to admire the beautiful Priestess over the goddess, which started to frustrate her. Although the Priestess was beautiful and loyal to the goddess, she was vain, selfish, and unkind. She took advantage of their generosity, thinking she could get away with anything due to her beauty and that she had her purity due to being Anithea's Priestess.  One day, the sea god Posiwin arrived at the temple, and when his eyes first saw the woman, he fell in love with the vain Priestess. He tried wooing her with gifts and charms, but she rejected him, calling his trinkets trash. When he tried again, it seemed to work, but the vain woman called him a repulsive fish and rejected his offerings. Enraged by her rejection, he chased her through the temple and mated with her while she was praying to her goddess for help.  The fish then did her in front of the goddess statue, looking down on them. After being satisfied with what he'd done, the sea god fled the temple just as Anithea arrived at her domain to see her Priestess, worn and panicking, with her clothes torn and hair a mess. The Priestess begged the goddess to punish the sea god for defiling the temple. Anithea was enraged that the girl had allowed herself to be taken advantage of in her temple.  The Priestess, blazing with fury, unleashed a torrent of shouts at the goddess for failing to pursue the sea god for his transgressions. Growing even more incensed by the audacity of the Priestess trying to dictate her actions, the goddess realized that the Priestess showed no remorse for her behavior. In response, the goddess decreed a punishment befitting the Priestess's callousness and transformed her from a once radiant beauty into a monstrous Gorgon, the embodiment of her inner ugliness.  The metamorphosis was a terrifying sight to behold. It happened so quickly that the Priestess attempted to apologize, but it was too late. Shimmering wings of gold burst forth from her back, her once smooth skin transformed into glistening scales, her flowing locks morphed into a writhing mass of venomous serpents, her delicate hands turned into razor-sharp claws with a metallic sheen, her feet evolved into powerful talons, tusks erupted from her mouth while her teeth elongated into menacing fangs. Her visage twisted into a grotesque, snake-like appearance.  The Priestess, now transformed into a Gorgon, fled in terror from the temple and sought the help of the nearby villagers. However, when they saw her, they were instantly turned to stone. Misunderstood and feared, the Gorgon was mistaken for an aggressor and was relentlessly pursued by the villagers. As she fled, she delved deeper into the dense woods, where she caught a glimpse of her reflection in a clear pond and recoiled in horror. Confronted by her monstrous form, the Gorgon sought refuge in the desolate remains of a temple dedicated to the very goddess she once revered but now rejected.  As her sanity slowly deteriorated day by day and night by night, she found herself descending further into the abyss of the monstrous nature that the world and the gods had branded her with. Despite numerous valiant attempts by brave warriors to defeat the beast on behalf of the goddess, just like her own heart, they all met the same fate, turning into statues that adorned the ruins surrounding the temple she called home.          The eerie and petrifying visages of terrified individuals stood frozen in time, encircling the ancient temple. Emerging from the temple's depths, the gorgon Clardusa, cloaked in a veil of shadow, ventured to survey the faces of the unwelcome intruders. Countless had sought to end her life, only to meet the same stony fate as those who preceded them. Upon reaching out to touch one of the statues, she recognized the likeness of a woman from the nearby village. This villager had arrived with a blade, seeking vengeance for her husband's transformation into stone. The frozen countenance of the statue conveyed the unyielding fury of its former living form.  She hears a noise in the distance of the wind and quickly hides behind one of the pillars. After hearing someone land, the sound of footsteps walking toward the noise stops as the invisible person becomes visible. He hears faint breathing coming from the pillar where Clardusa is hiding. He holds his blade behind the pillar around her neck with the pointy part on her cheek, causing small blood to come out from her cheek. As the blood falls into a puddle with a drop, her eye sees his reflection in the water below her, but it is small enough so he can't see her, but she gets a good look at him.  The individual was wearing a distinctive ensemble of mythical items. They donned the helm of darkness, a gift from Gaydes, and the harpe sword made of Adamantine, bestowed by Reus. Their winged sandals were a treasure from Julimes, while the mirror shield was a divine offering from the goddess Anithea. Lastly, the Hesperides gave them the kibisis, a special sack for carrying objects. Considering their possession of these extraordinary items, one might surmise that this person is a demigod. Furthermore, it seems likely that they had located Anithea's residence and may have been sent by her to carry out a sinister task, possibly involving the gruesome act of decapitation.  She needs to think fast. Trying to attack him head-on would most likely result in her death. He asked who she was, not knowing she was the Gorgon he sought. The Gorgon calls herself Minerva and asks for his name, to which he replies, ""Perball."" He tells her he's looking for Gorgon Clardusa, who is in this domain, and then asks why she is not turned to stone like the others. Minerva tells him that she recently arrived at the forest before him, and the Gorgon usually naps inside the temple at this hour.  After a brief pause, he expresses his gratitude for the information and instructs her to depart the woods, which she readily acquiesces. Perball then stealthily makes his way to the temple, utilizing his winged shoes to move silently and turning himself invisible as he enters. Taking advantage of his absence, Clardusa ascends to her temple by taking flight.  As she gently rests her head on the excellent, ancient stone, she strains to hear the faint echoes reverberating from the temple's depths. To conceal her presence, she artfully positions a decoy version of herself in the dimly lit interior, expertly crafted to mimic her form. Through this clever subterfuge, Perball would be convinced that he has stumbled upon the slumbering Gorgon, complete with convincing, pig-like snoring sounds.  Using the mirror to guide him, Perball got close to Clardusa's body, and then, with one fell swoop, he beheaded the ""gorgon"" with his blade. Perball put the head in the sack as he left the temple. After hearing the noise, Clardusa let out a sigh of relief. She could hear the rhythmic flapping of wings as Perball, the troublemaking pixie, flew away from her home. When she was finally confident that the coast was clear, Clardusa called out to the two hidden creatures. Emerging from their hiding spots were two remarkable creatures.  The first was a magnificent winged horse named Pegasus, its presence exuding grace and majesty. The second was a tiny, peculiar winged piglet named Chrysaor, its appearance contrasting sharply with that of Pegasus. Notably, Chrysaor carried a gleaming golden sword strapped to its back, an unexpected sight given its diminutive size. The two are Posiwin's twin sons. Clardusa gave birth to them a few years ago from her mouth. At first, they repulsed her because she was the sea god's kin. They were immune to being turned to stone. Eventually, she got used to them as they kept her company and prevented her from going insane.  Chrysaor approached his mother with concern as he noticed a small amount of blood on her face. He gently hugged her and licked the blood, worried about her well-being. Clardusa reassured him, and even Pegasus, the gentle creature, nuzzled the Gorgon, also showing his concern. With a smile, she comforted them, letting them know that everything was alright and no harm would come to her. In return, she embraced her sons, expressing gratitude for their care.  Perball, still in the forest, was alerted by Anithena, who appeared before him. She told him that he had failed to kill the Gorgon. Perball denied this and then pulled out the head as proof to her, only for her to point out that the head was a fake. He quickly turned his head to discover that it was nothing but a clever trick. The false head was a stuffed imitation, filled with fur and slithering snakes that viciously bit his hand, forcing him to release it. Filled with fury, he plotted his next move to confront the Gorgon again, realizing that this formidable creature was not as easily defeated as he had initially presumed.     Upon their return to the temple, Perball and the soldiers dispatched by Anithea were met with a relentless downpour. Suddenly, a blinding light cut through the rain, illuminating a previously unnoticed statue with its imposing wings outstretched, seeming to protect the ancient temple. Undeterred, they pressed forward, entering the dimly lit temple and seeing torches flickering on the walls. A sudden, chilling sound shattered the stillness, and before they could react, one of the soldiers was struck from behind, falling lifeless into the water. The gorgon emerged stealthily, her lethal arsenal at the ready - a bow, arrows, and a menacing sword. The soldiers lunged forward to confront the gorgon. Yet, their valiant efforts were swiftly met with a swift and deadly counterattack as the gorgon wielded a razor-sharp blade concealed on her back, mowing them down with terrifying precision.  Perball hides in the temple walls, using the mirror shield to make the gorgon think he is there as it hits its arrows at the shield. Perball, using a different shield, waits for the monster to come to him. The monster slithers more and more to where he is, and just as the gorgon is next to him, a quick swing from the sword beheads the beast. He hears a squeal like a pig as the decapitated head starts running around. When looked at in the shield's reflection, the head was a tiny piglet with fake snakes on the head. He tries to run but trips due to his legs, which are bleeding from the wound. The decapitated body removes its disguise as a winged horse grabs the Pig and throws him to its back. Said Pig, holding him tight and not letting go. They run outside the temple, with the piglet squealing for his mom's help.  Clardusa, startled by the commotion, elegantly descended from the sky and discovered Chyroar in distress. As she drew near, she noticed the crimson trail of blood seeping from his wounded legs, inflicted by the treacherous Perball. Without hesitation, Clardusa plunged her brass fingers into her flesh, unleashing a radiant healing energy to mend her son's grievous injury. Unbeknownst to her, Perball, shrouded in invisibility, stealthily advanced toward them, closing in from behind. With malicious intent, he gripped the nape of Clardusa's neck, preparing to deliver a fatal blow with his menacing blade. Suddenly, with a thunderous impact, Pegasus intervened, lashing out with a powerful kick that forced Perball to release his grip. Consequently, Perball's helmet tumbled from his head, exposing his visage and dispelling his invisibility.  Clardusa, with her heart pounding in her chest, seizes the fleeting opportunity and takes flight with Chyroar tightly clutched in her arms. Perball, his mind a whirlwind of emotions, watches with rage and helplessness as the gorgon escapes his grasp. As Pegasus swoops down in a valiant attempt to intercept Clardusa, Perball, fueled by fury and determination, regains his senses just in time to fend off the majestic horse's attack. With a calculated and powerful blow from his shield, he incapacitates Pegasus, sending the noble creature crashing down in a cloud of dust.  His gaze locked onto Clardusa, a smoldering ember of vengeance raging inside him. Perball grasps his sword with steely resolve and flings it at the fleeing gorgon. The blade strikes true, piercing Clardusa's left wing, eliciting a painful and eerie shriek from her. Despite the unbearable torment, she clings to Chyroar with unyielding determination as they plunge further into the depths of the ancient forest. Determined to finish the beast, Perball dashes into the woods to claim her head and present it to the king.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;1;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;semantic

She knew. It was impossible not to when he smiled like that.  How sad was it? That she had come to associate her husband's smile and happiness with his cheating?  Because she knew, she followed him, in the death of the night, to a mortal's house. She refused to call it by its name, the stalking, as she watched them talk.  Soon it became apparent, he had been seen this human the whole month, they wouldn't be that close otherwise; and she --the mortal, Semele-- knew he was him, knew he was Zeus.  When he cheated on her with a mortal, they either did not know who he was or they knew, but they only stayed together for a few days, a week at most.  This change in routine meant trouble for Hera; this could mean that he was ready to replace her, find someone better --someone like Amphitrite, someone who doesn't take revenge on his lovers, who cares more about the advantage such union gave her than the meaning of it--.  The normal punishment --on the lover, on their children-- would not suffice, she needed to send a message, make him realize --no matter how many he found-- only one would remain. He could only have her. This one had to be harsh, off-putting; he had to be the one to do it, to suffer the consequences.  So she stayed and waited until he went back up to Olympus, then she started talking.  ""How do I know he is Zeus?"", she said in the mortal's head. ""What proof did he give me to know he is a god, a king, the king of gods?"". The way it was phrased, the mortal could only think they were her own thoughts. ""There is a way to know"", she told her, ""If he swears on the river Styx to never hide anything from me, then I ask him to show me the real him, he will have no option but to do so"".  She tapped into magic, amplified those thoughts, erase all will to question them and what they entail.  She looked at her work, smiled and left. Zeus has in for a little surprise.  ""You promised!"", his lover screamed.  ""I know, I know, but please understand why I mustn't"", he begged. He could not help but hiss as his skin started to burn from breaking his new oath. He shouldn't have sworn, he knew better than to do so.  ""Do it!"". He shouldn't. He knew this was not her, she was not like that. Alas, there wasn't another option.  ""Forgive me, Semele"", he whispered and closed his eyes. He let her see him, with all his divinity, for only a second. Unfortunately, humans were far more fragile than he had ever cared to notice. He refused to look at her corpse, intensely burned in some places, completely raw in others.  He amplified his senses to detect all life forms in the area, hoping his aura did not reach outside the house. Then, he felt a faint life in front of him, it could not be her, it had to be...  He knelt at her side and put a hand on her; it wasn't her, it was something inside.  He took a shaky breath and did what he had to without acknowledging it.  Soon, but far too late for his mind, he had the demigod in his arms. It had not grown enough, and there was only one thing, one magic spell, he knew could help in this situation.  He sat down as the weight settled inside him. Took a minute, and left the house. Sooner or later a neighbor would find Semele and prepare her funeral, there was no point in staying there anymore.  He only left a note, ""Cause of death: divine aura, accident"".  He should go back to Olympus, but could not bring himself to do so, not at the moment. He needed rest and to process... All that.  So he flied to Crete, to his mountain, to his cave. It was smaller than he remembers, but he was small back then.  He gave a satisfied sigh at the sight of his old belongings, they weren't many, but they were his.  The once too large blanked now fitted perfectly as he settled down for a nap.  She did not see her husband until three days after Semele's death. She had gone down to her house after Zeus had been gone for one too many hours. She watched as the neighbors prepared the funeral, as they discussed a strange note that had been left there --obviously from the god-- and the odd burns on the house interior walls.  When he came back, she knew something was wrong, too wrong. He tried to hide it, and did it fairly well, but there were things everyone could notice. How defensive he was. How tired he was.  They had another fight, that was... Not good, but common, routine, safe. Except it wasn't, normally neither would cry, rarely she would cry --out of anger--, now he did --but he did not look mad, but sad--. And he fled the room, fled Olympus.  He did not come back until a week later. And all he said was ""You did it, didn't you?"" with the more apathetic face he had ever made. That's all he said for the rest of the month, refusing to talk outside of meetings if she was in the room.  Apollo tried to check on him multiple times, but he refused to. Ares began following him around the palace, claiming to be ""his bodyguard""; he did not seem to mind it too much. Poseidon and Hades tried to talk to him, to get to know what was going on, but could only get him to admit he needed a hug or help with something --sad enough, that was more open than usually--.  Then he disappeared again; Hermes claimed to have found him, but that Zeus refused to go back and preferred if no one knew his location. He went back and forth, from Olympus to the secret location, during the day --when Apollo was too busy to follow personally-- in the shadows --where the sun could not follow him-- and constantly changing the route --making it too complicated for Iris to deduce where he was headed--, and gave them Zeus' orders to maintain Olympus afloat while he was gone.  Months later, he came back.  Acted like nothing had happened, which only worried Poseidon and Hades more, though they did not express it verbally.  Refused to talk about it, if she brought it up; if Hera name-dropped Semele he looked at her dead in the eye and refused to elaborate.  ... At least she had gotten what she wanted, he was no longer open with any lovers --which did not mean he had any less, in turn, he had more and more and barely stayed a day with any of them--. Yes, he did not talk with her either... But it did not matter, right? They were never close like that, why would it matter?  Movement at her side woke her up. Her husband was rolling in his sleep, clearly disturbed. Concern filled her mind as she tried to calm him down, then to wake him up when that did not work.  He talked in his sleep ""Please, please, Semele, you know I... I cannot do that, please, I beg you"". She froze at that. She knew it had affected him, that was the whole plan, to affect him so much he would not dare find a replacement.  He started to cry, tears falling as he tried to stop the memory. He suddenly awoke with a scream. She hug him as he continued to cry, taking his hair in his hands and not looking at her, but pass her, like he wasn't in his room.  She rocked him back and forth and whispered reassurances in his ear.  When he managed to calm down enough to notice where he was, he just pushed her away. ""Do not touch me"", he said.  ""Is everything okay?"". They turned around to see Ares in the doorway, his words meant he had just arrived but how he was standing --hand loosely holding his spear instead of firmly griping it-- made her think he arrived there at the initial scream.  ""Ares"", the king said, ""do me a favor and help me get to Poseidon's, I have to talk with him"".  Their son went back to ""bodyguard mode"" saying ""As you wish, father"" while giving him a military greeting.  She stayed there, asking herself when did they fall apart.  The next years went by as the ones before them, with him cheating and she getting revenge --always making sure he wasn't there to see it--.  He either stopped having nightmares or stopped sleeping altogether as, no matter how late she went to sleep or how early she arose, she could never catch him at nighttime.  Their talks went back to normal and everything was as if the incident did not happen.  Then, the rumors of another child of Zeus appeared; an ascended demigod.  She ignored it at first, she had learned the bad way not all the mortals that proclaimed themselves to be children of Zeus necessary were. Some just thought the pros of being one outweighed the cons, some were demigods of other deities but thought only the king had demigod children for some reason, some were just playing.  But she did ask, ""This 'Dionysus' claims to be your son, is so true?"". The only thing he responded with was, ""He is the son of Semele, only that I will tell you. Don't you dare touch him.""  He left her again, this time as she tried to figure out how that was possible.";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;0;0;1;0;rule

Klytemnestra sat in her usual seat, waiting for her handmaids to bring all her jewelry. She had already made the sacrifice to the gods so she was allowed to wear the gold crown and gold ring[1]. Besides, wearing something fancier on a big day like today would be understandable.  It was quite early. Helios had not yet ridden his horse-drawn chariot. Candles lighted up the palace. Klytemnestra put a candle on the table, it gave off a tranquil glow, helping Klytemnestra see her reflection in the mirror. The queen's dressing room was not as crowded as usual. Normally, handmaids would fill the room with their sweet laughter and soft footsteps. Klytemnestra always enjoyed these morning chats with her servants. She was not a rigid person--during these chats, she rarely spoke but often listened. Whether it was the rustling sounds within the palace or the distant sayings outside, she had a firm grasp on every whisper through this way.  This does not mean that Klytemnestra was easy-going--she was, after all, from a noble family. Such a person she was, the queen of Mycenae, the daughter of Tyndareus.  The palace had always been a quiet place. The servants were all well-organized. They came and went quietly when their masters needed them, with heads bowed and submissive attitudes, and never dared to disturb their masters. Anyone who witnessed the manner of the palace would undoubtedly praise the mistress for how well she handled everything. ""She has talents,"" they might have said, ""she will be a great ruler one day...If she wasn't a woman.""  A knocking sound drew Klytemnestra's attention. She lifted her head to watch the handmaids come in with their hands full of shining diamonds. ""Hope you have had a great sleep, mistress."" The girls smiled at her and greeted her respectfully. They all stood still, waiting for Klytemnestra's orders. ""Thank you,"" Klytemnestra allowed them to come closer to help her put on all the garments and the sparkling crown. ""How are my children? Did Iphigenia wake up yet?"" Klytemnestra asked, something soft in her voice--she was a mother, and mothers cannot hide their love for their darling children. Some handmaids smiled gently, appreciating the queen's warm tone. One of the closest handmaids answered the question, ""They are doing well. The prince is still sleeping. Iphigenia has already woken up. She is getting dressed now."" Klytemnestra nodded and let out a soft sigh.  ""Are you worried about today's journey, my queen?"" As the dressing process neared completion, the handmaids held all unused pieces of jewelry and went back to their positions. Klytemnestra stood up, adjusting her gown one last time. ""They informed me that her future husband--Achilles, is a great warrior and a man with honour."" Klytemnestra was ready to wave her hand, sending away the servants. ""I hope for the best. Tell Iphigenia to hurry up.""  The servants signalled that they understood and they quickly dismissed themselves, leaving Klytemnestra once again alone in the room. Which is what she wanted. She needed some time to herself. As a mother, she was always proud of her children, especially Iphigenia, her eldest daughter. All the wonderful memories felt as if they had just happened, and yet her little girl was about to get married. Klytemnestra spun her golden ring with her fingertips unconsciously. She got emotional when she started to think about the future of Iphigenia.  Days ago, Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, her husband, asked someone to send her a letter.  ""Agamemnon sends a greeting to my Klytemnestra."" The letter started with, ""I have some news you may want to hear."" And that settled it--an arranged marriage for Iphigenia and Achilles. Klytemnestra did not mean to complain or dare to question the decision of the king but she did feel kind of lost. She thought at least she would have had a chance to discuss marriage with her children; she could have made a list of all those young, beautiful men around the country and picked the perfect one after some careful investigation. But Achilles, according to the old man who brought the letter, seemed to be a good man and indeed a good match for Iphigenia.  At least in this part, she felt truly happy for all this. Very well. She said to herself, ""I shall accompany Iphigenia, and I will walk her to her husband with joyful tears.""  Once again, Klytemnestra heard some footsteps and the gentle sound of fabric rustling. She could not control the smile on her face, even though she had not yet seen who had arrived. ""Mother[2]!"" A voice as clear as crystal rang out, full of joy.  Klytemnestra turned around to welcome her daughter. ""You look great, Iphigenia."" Klytemnestra praised. ""Thank you, Mother,"" Iphigenia said happily. She looked a bit nervous, with her fingers pinching the clothes, but she was absolutely stunning in that deep purple chiton, and her long, curly hair went all the way down her back; some gold-made hair ornaments shimmered in the candlelight, adding a glow to her pale skin. Klytemnestra leaned in to adjust the position of a necklace for her daughter and then, with some reluctance in her voice, she said slowly, ""We have to go.""  The carriage was prepared last night and is now waiting outside the palace. Klytemnestra took the lead and walked toward the gate, followed by her daughter and some handmaids who had been chosen by the pair to accompany them all the way to Aulis.  The carriage was dimly lit. Mother and daughter found themselves bored with few things to do. ""Have some rest, my daughter, if you are tired."" Klytemnestra noticed how Iphigenia had yawned several times. Normally she would not allow this to happen--how can a well-educated, noble lady be so relaxed? But she was willing to make some exceptions for now, as she could not imagine when she would be able to see her dear daughter like this again. ""I know the time is early; the black-robed goddess just drove her chariot across the sky."" Klytemnestra softly patted her daughter and encouraged her to lean against her shoulder. The carriage continuously rumbled along the road, not quite steady but somewhat hypnotic, especially in the darkness of the night. Iphigeneia shook her head. ""Thank you, Mother. But there is no need. In fact, ... do not blame me, Mother. May I ask for some information about my...future husband?"" A faint blush appeared on her cheeks, hard to notice in the darkness.  Klytemnestra smiled and said, ""Of course. I will tell you what I know, for this is a good match, I believe, and this will not be too inappropriate for you to know."" Then, Klytemnestra began to describe this mysterious Achilles, whom she did not even have a chance to meet for herself. ""Your father spoke of him often. He is one of the best warriors on our side, for he has great strength in both his mind and body. The fertile Phthia is his home, the well-known king Peleus is his father, and the water goddess Thetis is his mother. Such a nobleman he is that I am truly satisfied with this marriage, even though it was arranged by your father instead of me."" After hearing her mother say that, Iphigenia felt relieved. Her heart beat fast, and she cannot help but begin to anticipate her marriage.  ""I am just so delighted, my daughter, that you do not have to worry about any harm that will come to you."" After all the silence, Klytemnestra suddenly spoke again, with a low and soft voice, almost like a whisper. ""I am sure Achilles will protect you. May Artemis protect you for now and Hera will guide you in your marriage and household, my dearest daughter.""  For a moment, she seemed profoundly sorrowful, and Iphigenia keenly perceived that.  ""What happened, Mother?"" she asked cautiously.  ""...It was something before your father took me as his wife. But that is something a young lady like you should not ask about."" Klytemnestra gazed up at the sky, trying to determine what time it was and how long it would be until dawn. ""Yes, Mother. Please have some rest as well."" Iphigenia sensibly stopped asking and leaned to the side, falling into sweet dreams.  Under the pale moonlight, Klytemnestra watched her daughter rest, her chest filled with pride. ""I have raised her well,"" she prayed silently with all her heart--may the gods bless her and keep her safe from harm.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  After travelling for a long time, they finally arrived at their destination. The sun had risen. Klytemnestra could see the sea now, vast and deep, stretching endlessly. The surface of the sea shimmered with reflected light, adding some golden glitter to the deep blue. The weather was great, and the sea was calm.  Klytemnestra smiled. This was a good omen. The gods all rejoiced at this marriage.  Aulis was the place where the Greek fleet gathered. This place was supposed to be the departure point for the Greek army but for some reason, they stayed here longer. At least longer than Klytemnestra had expected. With that being said, Klytemnestra did not concern herself with the matter.  It wasn't her place. She had only one task here, and for this task, she was willing to take the risk of being here in the army with soldiers.  This was certainly not an ideal venue for marriage. Thus, Klytemnestra was more worried about Iphigenia, her young innocent daughter.  Agamemnon had already sent servants to welcome their carriage. These servants surrounding the carriage helped the royal family get out of the wagon. Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, was waiting here too. He looked strangely in pain, with his brow furrowed and the corners of his mouth turned down. How surprising! Klytemnestra thought to herself. The king did not look full of happiness like a normal father, especially since he was the one who planned the wedding. Some pleasant laughter rang out behind Klytemnestra. Iphigenia, unaware of her mother's thoughts, rushed into her father's arms. ""Oh, Father[3]! How I missed you!"" Agamemnon opened his arms and caught his daughter tightly. He found himself smiling too. ""My dear daughter, I missed you too,"" he said.  ""That's wonderful! I'm so happy to be with you and keep you company.""  The king lowered his eyes, avoiding the gaze of his family. ""Perhaps,"" he murmured.  Klytemnestra had been amused by their daughter's adorable little gesture, but then she couldn't help but fall into contemplation. Agamemnon let go of Iphigenia and started walking toward Klytemnestra. ""I hope the trip was not too boring and exhausting,"" he said in a hushed voice, with a faint smile. ""Lord Agamemnon,"" Klytemnestra bowed to him. ""We have come here and followed your commands, with hope and excitement."" Then she turned to her handmaids, who waited nearby, and asked, ""How is Orestes? Bring him to his father."" Soon the maids brought the young prince. Orestes was too small to notice anything; he was wrapped in warm and soft fabric. When seeing the face of his father, whom he had not met for quite a long time, Orestes waved his fists; a big smile on his face. Just as if he was aware of the upcoming wedding.  Despite this, Agamemnon still looked weary and sorrowful. ""How are you, Father?"" Now even Iphigenia had noticed that something was wrong. She grasped her father's arm and asked worriedly, ""Is everything alright? I hope you are doing well with all the soldiers, for I know the condition here can't compare with what our home has."" There was a look of concern in her eyes--such a sweet little girl.  There was a moment of silence. They were both waiting for Agamemnon's response. Agamemnon took hold of his daughter's hand; he gazed at his family members, and his tone carried the perfect blend of tenderness and sorrow. ""Forgive me, my daughter,"" he turned to Klytemnestra and added, ""I am sure your mother understands me--how can a father not be sorrowful when his dearest daughter is about to get married into another family? I have not seen you, my precious, in a while because of the war. When will I see you again? This I do not know.""  ""Then,"" there was a bright smile blooming on Iphigenia's face, like a flower in bloom. ""Please forget all the troubles, Papa. I will accompany you as long as I can."" The smile on their daughter's lips was so beautiful, and Klytemnestra realized that she was also beginning to grin. ""Very well!"" Agamemnon looks relaxed as he is comforted by his daughter's warm words, ""But do have some rest now, my daughter, for you have travelled far.""  Some servants stood silently by, upon hearing the king's words they stepped forward and took the initiative to lead the princess to the house.  ""Goodbye for now, Mother and Father."" The young princess bowed to her parents and then followed the servants. Orestes was with his sister right now and she carried him into the house. Even the horse-drawn carriage was taken care of and all the dowry Klytemnestra prepared was taken by some servants into the house.  Then there is only Klytemnestra there with Agamemnon. A silence fell between the two of them. Klytemnestra stared at her husband, wondering if he had any other orders. Agamemnon went silent for a while, and then he walked a few steps toward a more distant, secluded area and gave her a sign, asking her to follow.  Agamemnon was not always a talkative person, or he was, but not always with her. Honestly, Klytemnestra did not care. Their marriage could hardly be counted as a happy one, for she had no right to choose. What was even worse was how Agamemnon brutally murdered her real husband and son--he messed up everything precious to her and then, as a reward for winning the fight, she became a prize for him. But Klytemnestra was a Greek woman with a sharp mind, she knew how to stay in line. She managed the house carefully; she knew what to say to comfort Agamemnon. She gave birth to her children for him and the happiest moments she had were watching her children grow up. This was the light of her mundane life, and she prayed that their lives would be whatever they wanted.  ""I am sorry, Klytemnestra,"" the king's voice woke her. ""...Please follow my words. ...I will be in charge of the wedding ceremony. You should have some rest instead.""  ""...What?"" Klytemnestra widened her eyes, unable to believe what she had just heard. ""I will follow your command at all times, but I do not understand. How can a mother be absent from the wedding of her daughter?""  ""You'll see."" Agamemnon stood with his back to her; his clothes looked meticulously neat and his voice sounded cold. ""It is not suitable for my wife to be around all my men."" ""But then Iphigenia will be here alone, with the same men!"" Klytemnestra almost laughed at the absurd request. ""No, my king, I will not abandon Iphigenia here. I will hold the wedding torch and I will accompany my girl. Unless our customs and piety toward the gods are no longer important to you."" Agamemnon remained silent; Klytemnestra could see his clenched fist.  The silence continued for a while, then the king finally spoke, ""Fine, woman. Do what you want!"" His voice trembled slightly, which gave Klytemnestra a flash of confusion. However, she did not have time to think about it carefully. She turned back into the house to be with her daughter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The house was warm. Iphigenia and Orestes had already laid down, preparing to rest. Seeing that Klytemnestra had finally returned to the house, her daughter grabbed her hand and pleaded with her to stay. ""Please have some rest too, Mother. You are tired, I can see."" ""Do not worry about me, my daughter."" Klytemnestra gently ran her fingers through her daughter's hair, tidying it up for her. ""Mother will stay here with you. Now close your eyes, because there will be many things to do when you wake up.""  After ensuring Iphigenia had fallen into a deep sleep, Klytemnestra walked back outside, gazing at the endless blue sea and enjoying some breeze from Euripos through her delicate hair. The breeze blew away some of her unease. Ready to ignore the strange way Agamemnon behaved earlier, Klytemnestra resolved to prepare for her daughter's wedding with full enthusiasm. Agamemnon was probably too nervous about all this. Klytemnestra murmured to herself, ""Me too. This is the process everyone has to go through, but that doesn't make it easier to accept"". She sighed.  There were some footsteps near her. Klytemnestra turned to check, only to find that the other person seemed to not have noticed her. He was a good-looking man, with armour and weapons--he was a warrior, undoubtedly. More importantly, he looked like one of the best. The man seemed to be startled by her presence. ""Sorry, I did not see you,"" he said, taking a few steps back, respectfully not looking at Klytemnestra. Before Klytemnestra found a chance to speak, an old, hoarse voice suddenly spoke up. ""Our noble mistress, the Queen of Mycenae,"" an old man hurriedly approached them, ""please wait."" And then he recognized the man near Klytemnestra. ""By the gods! I did not know you were there too, Achilles.""  Besides the call of the old slave, Klytemnestra was surprised--she took a closer look at this man and tried to join her hand with Achilles. ""Child of the goddess, daughter of Nereus, you are a noble man--let us join our hands and rejoice! For we will soon be a family, after the wedding."" However, the son of the goddess looked confused; he seemed to know nothing at all, which made Klytemnestra uneasy. ""It would be completely wrong for me to touch what I shouldn't touch."" Achilles simply turned around and decided to leave directly.  ""Wait, the descendant of Aiakos."" The old slave stood in front of them, breathing heavily. ""I have some unfortunate news for my mistress, the daughter of Leda and Tyndareus--for I am your slave, my mistress; your father gave me to you when you married Agamemnon, and I stayed and will stay loyal to you."" He stopped Achilles with respectful yet determined gestures. ""This involves you too, the child of the goddess."" Upon hearing these words, Klytemnestra felt her heart tighten as if a hand had squeezed it. She turned away slightly, not daring to hear what the old slave had to say. ""I know you. Your loyalty is unquestionable. ...Please speak.""  ""There will not be a wedding, my mistress. Our king wants the princess to be there because..."" Klytemnestra anxiously twisted the ring on her finger, and she quickly urged, ""Please, go on.""  ""...Because he plans to kill your daughter and sacrifice her to Artemis.""  For a second, her mind went completely blank. She struggled to stay on her feet. Klytemnestra stared at the old slave intently, trying to detect any trace of dishonesty in his words. Nothing. The old slave was telling the truth, and deep down in her heart, she knew that.  No. No, no, no, no.  How could it be?  This could not happen. There was a sound echoing in her ears; it was her heartbeat, beating faster than ever. Her fingertips were as cold as ice. Klytemnestra closed her eyes, trying her best to figure everything out. Although she was not so intimate with her husband, she knew Agamemnon was not a madman. She tried to calm herself, but the overwhelming sense of panic and loss nearly constrained her throat.  Achilles stands silently behind her, seeming skeptical of all this. ""How could he possibly do that? Kill his daughter?"" ""What are you talking about?"" Klytemnestra says it with a cold tone. Her voice was full of anger. ""Don't you dare say that to me! I demand that you leave."" There were tears in the eyes of the old slave; his voice sounded slow, with a depressed tone. ""I was always loyal to you. Even more so than to the king. I have watched the young princess grow. It is with great sorrow that I talk about this.""  Klytemnestra closed her eyes, preventing any tears from falling. ""Tell us everything.""  Thus, the old slave spoke, ""The Greek army is gathered and ready to go for the war against Troy. Yet, our lord accidentally offended the goddess, the mistress of the woods and animals, the proud daughter of Leto, Artemis, with her golden bow. The goddess demanded our lord make a sacrifice; at least our seer Kalkhas said so. As for the wedding between the girl and the child of the goddess, it was meant to be a disguise. So that you, daughter of Tyndareus, would happily bring the poor girl with you, all the way from Mycenae to Aulis.""  Klytemnestra could no longer hold back her emotions. Everything had been prepared; there seemed to be no way out. Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. No human can suffer such pain--the mother is forced to be separated from her child permanently. Klytemnestra covered her face in a desperate attempt to wipe away all her sorrows, but it was pointless.  ""I apologize."" She tried her best to look better but failed. ""Alas! How can I hold back my tears, my poor daughter and I! Fate has been cruel to us! It was my husband's fault and his brother's problem, yet our daughter is the one to pay for the price!"" Clouded by her own tears, Klytemnestra heard Achilles's sigh. Like a tree hit by a bolt of lightning, she suddenly realized something: ""Achilles, you are the child of a goddess. You are indeed from a good family--a family nobler than mine. I pray that you may help us, for it is your name that my husband used to deceive us.""  No man could stand the suffering in her voice. This was the sound of a broken heart. Yet the child of the goddess, swift-footed Achilles, didn't answer right away. For a moment, he seemed to be lost in thought, and then, with seriousness, he replied, ""Do not worry, daughter of Tyndareus. I am willing to help in every way that I can. Although I don't know if I could truly make a change--Agamemnon is the leader, after all. I was looking for him; once I see him, I will talk about this with him.""  His words gave a glimmer of hope to Klytemnestra, yet her heart still ached terribly. The child of the goddess quickly left. As the leader of the army of Myrmidons, he had many responsibilities to his people.  Klytemnestra stood by the seashore for a long time, with only the old slave for company. The once-bright scenery of the beautiful Euripus seemed to have lost its colour. She took a deep breath, hoping to calm herself down so that her unfortunate daughter would not worry about her when she went back to the house. Unexpectedly, Klytemnestra encountered her husband on her way back to the house. Filled with anger and a sense of betrayal, she quickly caught up with him. Agamemnon was perplexed by her unusual behaviour.  He stopped and faced his wife. ""Is everything all right?"" Klytemnestra wanted to speak, but as soon as she opened her mouth, tears began to fall. ""I am here to ask you, my king."" Agamemnon looked confused, but his lips pressed together, and his gaze shifted to the side.  ""Ask whatever you want; I will always answer."" The king replied.  Now I get it. Klytemnestra thinks to herself. How could I not have realized this earlier? It was obvious.  ""Do you, or do you not, intend to kill our daughter? Kill the child we raised and loved for all these years.""  Her voice sounded calm. Despite all the tears, Klytemnestra continued to stare directly at the king. Agamemnon looked shocked. His eyes widened, but all of a sudden, he looked pale and depressed, as if all his energy had drained away. ""So, you have heard about that."" His reaction said everything.  ""How can you let this happen? It is our daughter whom you want to sacrifice. How can I, as the mother, witness all this?!"" ""Calm down, woman!"" Agamemnon became somewhat enraged, his voice turning hoarse. He could not bear to be accused by his wife. ""I tried to warn you! I sent the old slave to give you a letter, but he failed. Now soldiers have all heard about the sacrifice--they are angry and demanding that I do it sooner! How am I able to go against them all?""  ""How can you not? This is your daughter and now you are about to kill your own daughter with the knife in your hands! What kind of man would have a heart like this?"" After a moment of silence, Klytemnestra continued quietly, ""You had taken my child before and now you are about to do it again.""  ""You do not understand,"" said Agamemnon. ""I am with the Greek army. This is the only way to resolve the matter."" The cold words of Agamemnon disappointed her, yet she was more clear-headed than ever. She watched in silence as her husband hurriedly walked past her without further words.  I knew you would be like that. Klytemnestra felt frustrated. When she finally returned home, her daughter was already awake, smiling at her as usual.  ""I hope you had a good rest too, Mother!"" She greeted her mother with warm words. Klytemnestra tried to pretend everything was fine but she found it impossible. The moment she saw her beautiful and caring child and heard that gentle, happy voice, her tears flowed down her face like a breaking dam. The sorrow was too deep. She held her daughter tightly in her arms, which amused Iphigenia. ""What happened, Mama? You scared me."" Although she knew nothing, Iphigenia opened her arms and hugged her mother. ""Do not worry, I will be there with you.""  Yet, to her surprise, Klytemnestra held her even tighter, just like holding a treasure. The queen was reluctant to let go of the embrace. Who would have thought--she hugged all her children so many times in the past years, but at this very moment, she felt like it would never be enough. Iphigenia wiped away tears for Klytemnestra: ""Pray tell me, Mama. What happened? Did something happen to Father?"" Klytemnestra smiled weakly at Iphigenia, trying to offer some sort of comfort.  She did not know how to tell her daughter about this terrible, tragic fate. Her young girl had just come into her own, like a blossoming flower. There would have been a bright future. Klytemnestra had hoped for a happy marriage for her daughter, unlike the one she had--now this thought seemed like a joke. ""I do not know how to tell you, my child."" Klytemnestra pressed a kiss on Iphigenia's forehead and said, ""Woe is me! What can I do to protect you? Your father is going to do something terrible! The Greek army wants to make a sacrifice to the divine daughter of Leto.""  Speaking those words drained all her strength. Klytemnestra could not look at her daughter, for it would break her heart, though it had already been torn apart. Instead, she hugged Iphigenia desperately. Iphigenia did not speak a word for a few seconds. Klytemnestra noticed that the young girl was confused at first, but then suddenly understood everything.  ""My daughter!"" She cried. Iphigenia was silently shedding tears; her rosy cheeks were now pale as death. ""Mother, I cannot bear to leave you! I cannot bear to leave this world and enter the dark realm of Hades. I love the bright sea, the brilliant sunlight, and the lush trees. I beg you, Mother, do not leave me alone!"" The mother and daughter embraced each other and wept bitterly.  ""Mistress,"" a servant came in, interrupting them, ""there is a message from the child of the goddess, daughter of Nereus."" It was Achilles. Klytemnestra stood up in a panic. She eagerly asked the servant what the news was. ""He said--all the Greeks are against me. There is just no way."" Having heard such awful news, Klytemnestra felt distraught. She had expected this. Achilles was indeed a good man. He did not need to get involved in the first place.  Klytemnestra sat back down, overcome with distress. But then the worst happened. There were many noisy voices outside the house. They sounded Greek. Soldiers had gathered in front of the house, demanding to see the princess. Iphigenia softly took her mother's hand, seeking comfort from her mother. Her palm was moist with tears and Klytemnestra could not help but tightly squeeze her daughter's hand. Someone entered the room; it was Agamemnon. He silently gazed at his daughter and wife.  ""Father..."" Iphigenia cried, ""Please do not do this to me!"" However, Agamemnon looked away. He dared not look at his daughter. ""I am sorry, I am so sorry, my dearest daughter...but the Greeks forced me to do this.  They would kill all of us, all the family members, if I did not do this."" Klytemnestra spoke up, ""But you are the commander! You are sacrificing our beloved daughter for someone else's unfaithful wife and for the sake of your brother's affair. How would you think that this is a fair trade? Gods shall not permit such acts to happen unless they have made another arrangement."" Such a woman she was, even the king could not meet her eyes directly. The queen continued, ""I would take my daughter's place if it is possible. A mother should do anything for her children and I only wish for her well-being-""  Agamemnon sighed, ""Daughter of Leda, please do not say that. Have you forgotten your duty? You should head back to Mycenae, for there are other children for you to take care of."" The king of Mycenae said this to remind Klytemnestra of her position.  Noises outside the house grew louder, and Agamemnon wept as he spoke to his poor Iphigenia, ""My dearest daughter, the Greek soldiers are waiting, growing increasingly impatient. As for me, I would never want you to sacrifice yourself. I, just like your mother, love you as well."" Agamemnon approached Iphigenia, wanting to take his daughter's hand and hug her. The young girl looked surprisingly calm now. She asked her dearest father if this was truly the end; there was no other way out. ""If that is the decision you have made for me, dearest Papa, then please allow me to speak a few more words with my dearest Mother.""  Klytemnestra held onto Iphigenia with such strength, afraid that if she let go, she would never see her daughter again. ""Do not weep for me, Mother. This is my fate, and at least I hope I will be able to help our soldiers. Do not forget me; always remember my love, the deepest love a daughter could have for her parents. Take care of my brother and sisters.""  As the words fell, Iphigenia kissed her mother for the last time and she stood up to follow her father out of the house. Klytemnestra tried to shout out Iphigenia's name but the words got stuck in her throat. She struggled to grasp her daughter's wrist but failed.  Iphigenia glanced back at her one last time, ""Farewell, my dearest Mama.""  The immense grief engulfed Klytemnestra. She wanted to follow her daughter to the altar but found every drop of her strength had left her body. She could no longer cry, for there was only a hollow inside her. Her body was shivering and her fingers were all cold. She feels immediately sick. She can still recall the warmth of her daughter's hand. Everything in this room reminds her of Iphigenia.  How can I live when I go back to Mycenae? How can I travel with the horse-drawn carriage, the same carriage we used when we first came here? I should have asked Iphigenia to stay in the palace... Klytemnestra stayed in the house for hours, with nothing to do but reminisce about the memories of her daughter. Agamemnon came in once to demand she go back home. The king had already put on full armour, so Klytemnestra knew it was time to leave this place.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Klytemnestra had been ruling the kingdom for nearly a decade.  People were willing to recognize her as the new ruler since Agamemnon had gone to war. But she was a woman after all--therefore she needed support from other royal members, particularly Aegisthus, the cousin of Agamemnon. For a long time, their collaboration had been peaceful and uneventful. However, there was always a plan in Klytemnestra's mind. She had been thinking about this plan for ten long years, biding her time. She was the daughter of Tyndareus and Leda; she certainly was a clever woman who knew how to hide her emotions. And Aegisthus barely participated in making decisions. He was exactly the one Klytemnestra needed.  After all this time, the gods handed her a perfect chance.  ""Victory belongs to us!"" Klytemnestra turned to her people and announced the delightful news to them. ""Our king, my husband Agamemnon, sent us the message through Hephaestus' flame. Each beacon carried the fire from Ida[4], all the way to the house of Atreus."" People began to cheer and celebrate, and some started crying.  Everyone had been waiting for this moment for so long.  Immediately after the announcement, a sacrifice was arranged. Sheep and (Sleek heifers[5]) were prepared, waiting for the queen to start the ritual. Women were all following Klytemnestra, as they brought the woven peplos for the goddess. Aromatic wines were poured into the cups and ready for libation. People were excited. Klytemnestra tried not to recall that sacrifice that had once pierced her heart. She couldn't even stand by herself and face the whole ritual at that time; but now, she was watching animals get ripped apart[6] without any hesitation.  She won't let anything similar to that happen again.  After the celebration ended, Klytemnestra turned back to the palace, asking servants for details for a specific task: ""How are my children?"" A part of her heart trembled at this word. My children. She forced herself to stop thinking about it. Very soon someone respectfully replies, ""To the daughter of Tyndareus, queen of Mycenae, they are doing great and have settled down in the places you chose for them.""  ""Very well,"" said Klytemnestra, with satisfaction. This was the first step of her plan. She needed to send all their children away from the palace, probably for a few months, to ensure their safety. The rest of the plan could wait until Agamemnon returned from Troy.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  King Agamemnon returned a few weeks after people received the news. He went back with so much glory that everyone was proud of him and the Greek army. Klytemnestra bowed to him, showing respect and love with all the luxurious candles and tapestries. Of course, she did not really mean that; these are the gifts tainted with hostility. She nearly sneered openly.  There was another girl--Kassandra, brought with Agamemnon from Troy. The king commanded servants to treat her as a guest, so Klytemnestra greeted her herself. She neither envied nor resented the girl. She was just curious--how would this 'war prize' react, after she fulfilled her plan? No one could understand the words of this former princess of Troy, so soon enough she was left all by herself in the palace. Klytemnestra took her leave to continue accompanying the king.  ""My king, you must be tired."" Klytemnestra smiled gently at Agamemnon and guided him to the bath. ""Please have a rest and take a bath!"" Agamemnon looked surprised and pleased; he was more than happy to be led to the bathhouse by Klytemnestra.  ""The water is ready,"" Klytemnestra said, feeling a surge of excitement. Her hands were trembling slightly and her heart beat rapidly. She tried her best to conceal it, hoping the king would not find out. And--one, two, three. Now was the time! Klytemnestra quickly wrapped the king in a robe--a robe that was so tight and not convenient to take off. Agamemnon appeared shocked and confused, but he did not have a chance to ask.  ""In case you are wondering, this is for Iphigenia."" Klytemnestra did not miss the fear in Agamemnon's eyes, even though it lasted for only a short time. The king began to grasp what would happen to him. His pupils shrank in fear as he struggled within her trap. But it was too late. Klytemnestra raised her weapon with the enjoyment of vengeance. The weapon, which she had hidden long before Agamemnon arrived.  Then...  Shunk, Shunk, Shunk...  Three sounds of stabbing and a long sound of howling. Agamemnon lay heavily in the bathtub, blood staining the entire pool.  ""...and you,"" Klytemnestra says, turning around and finding Kassandra. For some reason, the girl appeared here, witnessing the scene of the murder. ""Give me a reason not to kill you."" Klytemnestra casually wiped the blood off her clothes and skin, and then tightened her hand on the weapon, ""For you are from my enemy's side.""  Surprisingly, the former Trojan princess laughed. She did not look at Klytemnestra; instead, her gaze was fixed on the dead body, and she seemed to mutter some words quietly: ""...now my duty is truly done. I have made my revenge, though through another woman."" Then she walked towards Klytemnestra, with the flames of madness burning in her eyes, ""I have seen all--at least I will die with the satisfaction of revenge!""   ...  Voices slowly gathered on the other side of the door; the court elders must have heard the commotion inside the bathhouse.  Klytemnestra calmly lowered her weapon. Her mind wandered, recalling the old memory of when her daughter was taken away for sacrifice. Back then, the only thing she knew was how to cry.  I have to find Aegisthus, Klytemnestra thinks. That would be the final step of the plan--he will be the new king, but I will be one with the real power.  She glanced at the two bodies on the ground, and a small smile appeared on her face.

And Orpheus was sick of singing.  He had gone down.   He had come back.  He had stepped into the light--and turned.   Forgetting, after the eternal walk, that Eurydice was still in the darkness.   Her silent shadow smiled at him, forgiving.  And his beloved fell below forevermore.      Orpheus gave up his craft.   He had been great, once, but singing had not saved her. Singing would not save him.   The rumours spread. He had traded his voice to a god to restore her, he had lost his voice from sadness alone, he had never been all that good anyway.      Truth lay in the quietest places.   Orpheus had grown used to singing with Eurydice. Nightly duets, dancing and singing until their voices and their legs gave out.   Everything sounded different now, without her.      They had been Orpheus and Eurydice, and now he was Orpheus alone. He fell from favour in the eyes of his fans and his friends, no longer willing to perform for them.     Some, though, did not care what he was willing to do. The Maenads, followers of great Dionysus, begged Orpheus to sing for them, to love them. He refused.      Orpheus returned to his mother Calliope, who consoled him in his grief. He turned, too, to Apollo, waking each dawn to admire the rising sun. He found solace in the god who had once granted him his music.      Jealous Dionysus offered Orpheus wine, love, treasures beyond any he had seen before. But Orpheus refused, tired of the endless revels he had once played his music for. This angered Dionysus, and he ordered the Maenads, already frenzied by Orpheus's rejection, to tear the former musician to pieces. Orpheus, thinking of his lover in the underworld, did not struggle.      When the deed was done, the Maenads feared the repercussions of their murder. They threw the pieces of Orpheus into the river, and he was taken by the water.      His pieces made their way to Calliope, who cried and cried for her lost son. She stitched him together and buried him next to his wife, and so they became Orpheus and Eurydice once more.      Above, there was grief for the once-great musician. But down in Elysium, Eurydice was reunited with her love, and the eternal night rang with their voices entwined. ";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule

The Sea, jealous of Wisdom, fought for the city but was unable to take it within its grasp. Wisdom proudly took over the lands, naming them after her, where people prospered under her intelligence and creativity.  Many years later a young girl joined Wisdom's temple to be a part of her priestesses as no man could enter her temple. Wisdom protected those girls and women from the men they could not escape for if they tried to enter she would smite them from which they stood. The young girl loved the temple filled with warmth and love from the other priestesses she met. Yet she was not whole, she longed for more a glimpse of hope or love but she knew she could never get it.  Days turned to months and months to years, the girl grew into a beautiful young woman captivating the hearts of many but most of all Wisdom as she watched her from Mt. Olympus. The young woman was kind to all giving when she could and always taking care of the others at the temple. Wisdoms interest grew soon leaving her longing for a chance to speak to the young woman that brought light to her life. Little did Wisdom know that Sea was also watching the young woman noticing her beauty as well as Wisdom's interest in her plotting ways to make the young woman his.  One day Wisdom's dream came true as the young woman knelt at her altar alone. Wisdom went to meet this woman and how glorious she was, kind yet cunning, strong yet beautiful, she was everything Wisdom ever wanted and the young woman wanted Wisdom for herself as their love blossomed under the blessings of a certain Goddess. Sea's anger grew to a boil once he learned of Wisdom and her new found lover, hatred raised the sea to meet the lands of the city yet a flood did not come. Sea's plan grew and took shape as he traveled to Wisdom's temple for her lover.  Sea crashed into the temple filling it with water inducing panic in all those inside but Sea let the water seep back before it killed. Sea tore through faces before he found Wisdoms new lover, her face was struck with panic as Sea beckoned for her to come to him. She obeyed but only out of fear, kneeling before Sea, she pondered how she got here before Sea took her face in his hand pulling up to face him. The young woman knew of cruelty and lust yet never had she seen it like this on the face of Sea. The young woman knew of Wisdom and Sea's rivalry yet she never thought she would become a player in the obscene games they played.  Sea took in the young woman's face and how lovely she was before he pulled her up dragging her deeper into the temple. The young woman tried to free herself from Sea yet she was only mortal, weak against Sea's power.  *****  Upon the altar the Wisdom first met her lover Sea took to defying her as she pleaded for him to stop.  ****  Wisdom could no longer watch as she descended to Sea and her lover, Wisdom banished Sea from her temple taking her poor lover in her arms in protection. Wisdom called that Sea be punished for his deeds yet as he was Thunder's brother Posiden he went unpunished. Wisdom or Athena, as she was known fondly by the young woman, Medusa, decided to protect her lover by bestowing gifts of impenetrable skin, eyes that could see no matter the light, venomous teeth to bit her enemies, immortality in a sense, and talons that could perce anything. Athena made her lover deadly yet beautiful all the same.  Mesmerized Medusa looked at her reflection her hair fell softly around her heart-shaped face as her eyes glittered green with cat-like pupils her nails had lengthen and her skin was still pale yet took on a rougher texture she smiled then letting her now sharper teeth shimmer before kissing Athena in gratitude and relief that she did not abandon her. Then Athena told Medusa that if a man looked at her he would turn to stone god or mortal to keep her safe. Athena took her to a beautiful beach far away from any known lands where mortals and gods could not find her. They would spend days laying together on the beach building a lovely home of marble and olive trees.  Athena would leave her lover for heroes that needed her help yet would always come back to Medusa. Years passed, a tale of a hideous monster that would turn everyone to stone spread through the lands as Posiden tried to sabotage Athena and Medusa's relationship. Many men were sent to slay Medusa only to be frozen in stone added to the lover's garden as decoration.  One day Thunder called Athena to Mt. Olympus to have her help his son defeat Medusa to claim victory and save his mother. Athena agreed to help the son yet not if it would kill her lover, Thunder angered by Athenas refusal claimed he would raise her cities spreading destruction and letting mortals curse her name till she faded from their minds. Athena was stuck, ending with her agreeing to help Thunder's son. She gave Thunder's son her shield with Hermes by her side to prevent anything that might deviate from Thunder's plan. Once Hermes went with Thunder's son she weeped for her lover's future, Athena could only hope that Medusa would live killing Thunder's son before he killed her.  Days passed before Athena could visit her lover at their secret beach as she touched down upon the warm sand. Something wasn't right. Athena called for Medusa but only the breeze answered her calls. She searched for her lover only to come across her mutilated corpse, head cleanly cut off and slashes upon her torso. Athena fell to her knees crawling to Medusa's body cradling it in her arms as she cried. She cursed Thunder and his son for the death of her beloved if only she could have done something, anything to save her.  Athena buried Medusa under their favorite tree in their garden of marble and olive before taking her place back upon Mt. Olympus, never offering help to any of Thunder's children again for the loss of her love. Thunder would tell the story of his son, Perceus saving his mother by beheading a disgusting monster that could turn men to stone with a glance and gifting it to her tormentor and his cronies. As well as how he saved a beautiful princess marrying her and spending their days together but never the love story of Athena and Medusa, lovers forever separated by the jealousy of Thunder or Zeus and Poseidon.;;;1;0;0;0;rule;0;1;1;0;semantic;1;0;0;0;semantic

I tried to capture those lights, tried to hold them in my hands. I used my power of healing, broken bones were repaired and opened skin was closed. I sang, singing every song he liked. Why do they sound sorrowful ? My head dropped onto his chest, hoping to hear that rhythmic, strong heartbeat. Nothing. """;narrator;first;Hyacinthus;Hyacinthus;;;;;Zephyrus;Zephyrus;;;;;discus;discus;;;;;"Sun is rising. The cloud reflects some colors, mostly pink, but there are also a couple purple clouds that are turning red with the sun. I frown. I pick up my silver bow and aim at those clouds. The arrow breaks them into nothing.     So I was driving my swan chariot, passing through the sky, enjoying the little film happening on earth. Listen to the words they praised for me! Every day they sang my name, and sometimes I would grant them glories if their offerings pleased me. Look at them, a bunch of cowards, rather than fighting in a war, they left their children in hunger, sacrificed those plump sheep to me and hoped I would give them a little pity. Ha, how funny! When necessary, I indeed gave them a little hope, made one of them a hero, so the others would actually believe the same glory will shine on them! How foolish! They would never be loved by me, unless those special ones...   My eyes stopped on a young man. He was beautiful, more than beautiful, even more beautiful than some of the gods. His chestnut colored hair quivered in the wind, every tan skin and muscle showed his masculinity and strength. His brown eyes were determined and sharp as he swung the sword, and his motions were clean and steady.  I want to own him.   ""He is cute,"" Zephyrus, the west wind, appeared and smiled.  ""He is, and he will be glorified in my name,"" I was annoyed.  ""I do not think so. He will not be your pet just because you are the son of Zeus.""  ""We shall see.""  We both landed on the courtyard the young man was training at. I almost laughed at the look that he was giving, showing his terror.  He kneeled so fast and lowered his head, dropping his sword aside, ""Your honor, the great god of sun and archery, and the west wind.""  I grinned, ""get up, and tell me your name.""  I could tell he was scared, too scared to look at me, ""Your honor, I am Hyacinthus, the son of Pierus, the prince of Sparta.""  ""I said get up, mortal,"" I wanted to look at his face again.  ""Oh, my dear, do not be scared by him,"" Zephyrus went up and lifted his face, ""just be yourself.""  I frowned that Zephyrus contaminated his face, but Hyacinthus did look up. With this closer look, he was even more beautiful. Every line, every shape on his face rhymes perfectly. He looked straight into my eyes, fear and a little shine of the water in his eyes.  ""I gave you an offer,"" he shivered again when I spoke, ""you come on to my chariot, and in return, you will be honored in my name.""  ""I can show you everywhere in the world, and you will be remembered when the west wind blows,"" Zephyrus was pleased by his offering.  The mortal looked at Zephyrus, then turned to me. He stood up, I was better, or maybe it was the fear, he stepped to me, ""Thank you, the god of  sun and archery, for your kind offering,"" then he turned to Zephyrus, ""and thank you the west wind, I feel honored by you.""  Hyacinthus stepped onto my chariot, not with full confidence, but he was on it. I smiled at Zephyrus.  See, mortals know who will give them more. Then I stepped on to my swan chariot, not looking back at Zephyrus's swelled face. There might be a tornado tonight.        To make a person respect you, you must show them your power.   We were flying with my chariot, so silence in sound, but not silence inside.  ""Speak,"" I did not look at him, to show my carelessness.  ""Your honor, where are we heading?"" His voice was solid but lithe in the silence.  ""My lands.""  Followed by silence.  I turned to him. He was scared, again, so he stood up. He stood too quickly, so he lost his balance. He was about to fall out of my chariot. I grabbed him, pulling him back to the seat. His skin was rough by the training but soft and delicate.  ""Thank you, your--""  ""Thank me with your heart. We cannot be companions if you hold all your questions.""  Silence again. The silence was dragging me to anger. I could throw him from my chariot.  ""Companions?"" He finally spoke, ""No hard mission like slaying a dragon?""  I almost laughed, ""then the dragon would be dead already, no need for you to kill. Come, we arrived. This is one of my lands, Delphi.""  This was a wild highland of Delphi. I did not want anyone to interrupt us. Hyacinthus was amazed by the city below, by its prosperity.  ""Done, let us go to the next--""  ""Wait!"" I was surprised. A mortal interrupted me, but also I was surprised that I was not feeling mad at all. Hyacinthus seemed to notice what he had done, he lowered his head and remained quiet.  ""It will be ruder if you stop me for nothing.""  He was scared again, not knowing what to do, ""may I stay longer? Perhaps join the market?""  ""No,"" he must stick to my plan, so he will know how strong I am and feel honored and satisfied.  He looks scared again, but more upset this time.  ""Why do you show grief, mortal? Are you not happy that you came to Delphi, the sacred land of Apollo, with Apollo himself?""  ""I am happy, your honor, I am happy for your kindness. We may leave."" He lowered his head, trembling.  ""You dare to lie to a god and show fake gratefulness?"" I was angry, a foolish mortal again. He ruined everything, ""I have changed my mind, you will be sent back to Amyclae and never be loved by me--""  ""It was you who said we are companions! And you even do not know what a companion is! At least show me some respect!"" He ran down to the hill.  I was shocked. Never a mortal would rebel against me, never asking me for respect. Was not my notice of them the greatest respect? Why was he angry? He should be afraid in front of my anger.   I found him in the crowd. He was easy to find, among the ugly, small mortals.  ""Show me what companions do,"" there was no compromise, but only my interest in him.   ""Call me Hyacinthus, I have a name.""  ""Hyacinthus,"" my tongue was twisted maybe, I do not often say a mortal's name.  ""Greetings, Apollo,"" he looked back, not in fear, but with a smile, softer than the spring, fiercer than the summer. Brighter than ever.  I looked at him, then looked away. It was absurd to hear a faint, weak voice saying my name directly, but I felt no anger, my blood and heart were plumping faster, not knowing why.        Days, maybe months passed. Everything was following my plan, well, mostly. I showed him my silver bow and archery, granted him a little glimpse of the art of prophecy.  ""What prophecy do you see about me?"" Hyacinthus lowered my silver bow and asked.  ""A flower, a single stem and many little small flowers attached to it. Purple with red on the edge.""  ""Hmmm, it might be a flower you made for me.""  I smiled, not answering.  Most mortals praised me for my power of archery, and I was more known for it. Hyacinthus, instead, loved my music more than my power. I taught him how to play the lyre, his hands seemed small on my lyre. He played me a little piece, not refined, but it was good. Then I played to him. He closed his eyes, sinking in my music.   The time seems to freeze, sunbeams laid on his face, me playing my lyre and him being the audience. My impulses wanted to break through this moment. I moved closer. I kissed him on his forehead. He suddenly opened his eyes, blushing.  ""So what is that wreath on your head?"" He gave me an awkward smile.  I grinned at his little shyness, ""a laurel wreath, turned from a nymph named Daphne.""  ""What happened to her?"" He looks a little worried.  I told him how I made Ero, the love god, angry, then shoot me with my arrow to make me indulge in love with Daphne while she was shot to hate me. Finally, she turned into a laurel tree to escape from me. And there were more women who ran away from me for Ero's sake.  ""You never know how scared I am that you may be another scam of Ero.""  I mean it.  The feeling that I love those women but not loving them myself disgusted me.  Hyacinthus grinned, taking my hand to his chest. His rhythmic, strong heart beat with my impulses, my heart never beaten so fast. He closed his eyes, his lips met mine. My mind went blank, filled with him, his lips, his breath, his warmth,  his everything.  For the first time, something was not under my control.   He then let go, looking at me. His eyes glowed with the world, with me.  ""I am here. I am real.""     ""Here is Delos, where I was born."" We arrived at the last stop of my plan.  Hyacinthus was excited to see my past. His eyes shone with curiosity. He ran up to the cabinet, where I lived when I was still a young god. I stayed at the same place and watched him looking around. He put his hand on the wood door, he turned back and looked at me, "" you are not coming with me?""  I shook my head. Nothing in there was worthy for me to look at and recall. The past laid in the past, and I am no Apollo who I was.  Hyacinthus walked out from the cabinet, still with his curiosity, ""who owns the other bed? And that loom? You were a hunter?""  ""The other belongs to my sister, Artemis, goddess of wild animals and the hunt. Yes, we hunted in the woods a lot. And that loom belongs to my mother, Leto,"" I have not spoken that name for so long.  ""Well, then I must salute to your sister and mother, or I would be rude.""  ""No need, Artemis does not live here anymore, and Leto is dead,"" I paused and looked at him, he had a worried look on his face, ""She was killed by a serpent named Python, who was sent by Hera for her jealousy. No worries,"" I smiled at him, ""The serpent was killed by me when  I was still a child. You know, I am a good hunter.""  He looked at me, full of sorrow in his eyes. I did not quite understand why he was sad  about my mother's death, even I did not grieve for her death. It was normal that the gods fight each other for jealousy. The ones with no power will be the sacrifice of the fight, and the strong ones like me, will win and enjoy the glory.  No need to grieve for the forgotten.   Hyacinthus seems to see my confusion. He gave me a hug, his hands tapping on my back, our hearts joining each other. I felt something melting in my heart. Maybe  I was sad.   ""Come, bring me to my place,"" he stepped on the chariot.        ""Here, put this on,"" Hyacinthus handed me mortal clothes.  ""For what,"" I wore the clothes. The fabric was rough and the weaving was not fine. I felt uncomfortable and  ashamed.  God in mortal's clothes, what a joke. My skin will remember this disgrace forever.  ""You showed me your lands and your home, now it is my turn.""  I thought he was going to let me visit his palace house, showing his wealth among the rest. Instead, he brought me to the harbor, dirty, messy, and smelly.   Ships and vessels moored and settled sail. Mortals walked around, busy at their work. Sailors yelled to sail, sellers yelled for sale. Young mortal ran around, chasing for money and bread. Female mortals weaved in the shop and carried fabric around. Dogs and cats hid in the dark or found food in the trash. In those dim light allay, homeless mortals laid on the ground, hoping for a rescue.  Something stopped me from laughing at them.   ""Sorry for staining your deity, but this is us.""   Us. Mortals.  What was I hoping for, we would never be the same. We were born to be different, so we would live parallel, the lines that could be so close, but never intersect.  He then went on, fulfilling the duty of a future king. He granted bread and covers for those homeless, hopeless ones. He smiled at them and wished them a good day. I did not understand why he helped them. They were no use for this state. It was already a great mercy to leave them alive rather than killing them.  ""People are the core of a kingdom,"" Hyacinthus seemed to read my mind, ""a king is only powerful when he gets people to protect. Without them, a king is just a delicate egg shell,"" he looked at the cracked egg on the ground, ""Here, try it,"" he handed me some bread.  I found a woman, covered in a ragged cloth, sitting on the ground and begging for some change to live through the day. I thought I was standing close enough. This was absurd, all I needed to do was to throw the bread in front of her and leave, and she would be grateful for the bread falling from the sky. No need to have a fake smile. I looked at Hyacinthus, he gestured to me to squat. Squat? A graceful god never squatted, only laborers and mortals did that. With a sigh, I bent my knees and lowered myself to the same height as the woman. I was never this lowly, this would be the stain of my deity.  ""Mor-- Lady, wish you a nice day,""  I reached out my hand with the bread. I looked away, trying not to stare at her. This embarrassment was killing me.  ""Thank you! Oh thank you, kind young man,"" the woman looked up, staring straight into mine. There was liquid at the corner of her eyes. Her face was covered with wrinkles and scars, burn scars, beating scars. Her eyes were like a dead hollow, but I could see the reflection of my light. This horrible figure stabbed me like a knife, injecting a feeling of silver, pricking at my spine.  Guilt and apology.  Her two hands grabbing my arm, trembling, ""May the great god of sun bless you.""  I grinned, would I bless myself? I looked at Hyacinthus again. Maybe I would, ""May the god of sun bless you too,"" I put my hand on her shoulder, letting my power of healing flow in her. The wrinkles and scars slowly faded from her face. She smiled, like a yellow flower on the cactus in the middle of a desert. It bloomed in me, releasing a yellowish feeling mixed with the silver.  Joy and sadness.   I went back to Hyacinthus. The new feeling still remained in me. It pleased me but also discomforted me. I would say I was a little scared of this feeling.  Feeling mortal.    I did not look at him, pretending to speak delightfully.  ""I think there was some problem with her eyes, the liquid that I cannot heal.""  He laughed. His laughter made me laugh too, ""That is no disease, it is tears.""  ""What for?""  ""It cannot be described. Sometimes it is sorrow, sometimes joy, sometimes anger. It can barely be held by reason.""  Then I would never have a tear.  Nothing escapes my chess of reason.   We moved on. Let that silver yellow flow in me.   There was a miracle that happened in that harbor of Sparta.        The night fell. The stars hung above us, the trees hid their green, the owls stared their eyes in the darkness. Artemis was somewhere in the world hunting her prey.  ""Ah, what a nice day,"" Hyacinthus leaned on a rock. Dim light reflected on his visage, making his face more angular.  More beautiful than ever.  His eyes shone with the stars.  I sat beside him. The grass surrounding us was lit up by me, ""why is it nice?""  He glimpsed at me with a weird look, ""why are you always looking for a reason? There are many things that do not have a reason,"" he leaned towards me, so close that his breath touched my neck, ""but if you really want a reason--"" he bit my ear gently and retreated with his bright smile, but there was a little shyness this time.   ""Well, then this will be a nice day for me too,"" I turned to him, pressing my lips onto his. Why would I say that,  every day for me is the same.  But maybe these days did go well. Hyacinthus responded and pressed harder. Tonight,  it will be nice.        One good thing about being a god was that I did not need to sleep, but I could. Hyacinthus lay on my shoulder, his chest raised and fell along his breath. My head rested on his, I closed my eyes.  I was sitting on my bed, not the one in my palace, but the one in that cabinet on Delos. Everything was at their same place: my bed next to Artemis's, our desk for crafting weapons, and that loom covered in ashes that our mother used to weave at. I pushed the door open and saw the tree that Artemis and I used to target. At the bottom of that tree, there was a woman weaving.  ""Mother?""   The woman looked up, smiling at me.  I could not believe what I was seeing, no prophecy showed my mother was still alive. I walked faster and faster, and I ran. My body felt smaller and smaller - I was a child. I rushed to her, but I was tripped by a rock. Mother stood up and granted me a hand. She smiled, the smile that I remembered in my childhood, ""Here, Apollo, get up.""  I reached out my hand and tried to grab hers. Behind her, I glimpsed a slender figure - a serpent, curling on a branch, opened his mouth and bit mother's neck. Instinctively, mother fell on the ground. Her purple robe was soaked in her red blood.     Dead in that purple with the red on the edge.    ""Mother!' I screamed.  ""Apollo?"" Hyacinthus looked at me with worry, ""what was it?""  I opened my mouth, but the words stuck at my throat. When did I start to find comfort from mortals? I need no comfort at all. I shook my head and smiled, ""Minor things.""  Hyacinthus said nothing. The night went on, and I fell asleep again. In my half-consciousness,   I felt warmth , like I was held in my mother's arms.        The sun shone in front of us, the wind blew up the corner of his clothes against my skin.  Itchy.   ""You sure you wanna play discus with me?"" I looked at him, and could not believe a mortal who is shorter than me for a whole head dared to challenge a god.  ""Yeah, is there a problem?"" He looked up straight into my eyes. My light shone in his eyes, but his light never faded.   ""Sure, then show me what a mortal can do,"" I stepped backwards, holding the discus tight in my hand. I twisted my back, tensing up my muscles...    ""Ha,"" the moment I threw the discus, it disappeared in the light.  He narrowed his eyes to try to follow the discus, but he suddenly looked at me with that bright smile, ""write me a song if I catch it."" Then, he ran forward like an arrow of my bow, fast, clean, determined.  His muscles tightened to a gorgeous shape as he ran. He looks free, free from the world, free from being a mortal. He got further and further, becoming a little dot on the paint of blue sky and green grass. I never knew the power of nature itself. The sun stayed in the sky, clouds stopped their steps, trees and leaves remained where they were. Then all together, with a gust of west wind, quivering, trembling...     Wait.    ""Hyacinthus!"" I ran to him, as fast as I could, the wind crying and laughing besides my ears.  How could I, how could I not notice, how could I forget? Jealousy is their daily entertainment. If they cannot have it, then no one can. This was a game about me and Zephyrus, and the wager is Hyacinthus.  ""Run Apollo, run. We made a bet about you, and I say the discus is faster,"" Zephyrus laid in the air beside me, laughing harder and harder.  I am Apollo, son of Zeus and Leto, this kind of small breeze cannot stop me. The ground under my feet flew back. The discus carried by the west wind was still far up in the air. Closer and closer, I can almost touch him, touching  my sun ...   ""No no no, Apollo,"" a surge of west wind made me lose balance, ""the audience are glad to see the son of Zeus is defeated by a discus.""  Hyacinthus noticed my existence. He turned back and saw me sitting on the ground. He cannot see Zephyrus, neither hearing the wind, nor hearing me.  ""What,"" Hyacinthus laughed, laughing so hard that he could not even open his eyes, ""a god can fall on the ground too? Here, get up,"" he granted a hand to me. The sun shines behind him, but it seems like it is himself shining. For a moment, my mother was standing in front of me. I tried to reach for his hand, grabbing the light.  The discus was getting closer. I had no time. I did not care what power I was using. The grass was decaying but reviving again. Songs were sung and poems were told. Thousands of prophecies flew through my vision. I was standing up, it seemed like the pressure of the wind was weaker. I leaned forward, reaching to his arm.  So close!  My hand broke through the barrier of the wind, grabbing his hand.   A prophecy blinded my eyes.  The flower.   The discus rolled on the ground. Trees and grasses slowly danced in their tempo. Birds twittered on the branches. Sunshine spilled on us.  Warm.    He was in my arms. A smile was still on his face. His chest stayed still. The blood from his forehead dripped into my hand.  Warm.   The light in him was fading.    No! No no no, this could not be.    I tried to capture those lights, tried to hold them in my hands. I used my power of healing, broken bones were repaired and opened skin was closed. I sang, singing every song he liked. Why do they sound  sorrowful ? My head dropped onto his chest, hoping to hear that rhythmic, strong heartbeat.   Nothing.   My eyes felt weird, weird liquid filled in them. A tear, that is what he told me.  My tear dripped into those lights. They glowed. Stems and leaves grew out first, then a little purple bud attached, popping up. Last, it bloomed. I held it in my palms, blood dripping into the flower.    That purple with the red on the edge.    I stood up, putting the flower on his chest. Slowly, he sank into the ground, and surrounding him, purple flowers broke from the dirt and bloomed.      That day, I truly felt sadness. But then I lose it. Something overcomes the grief, hiding it away. My heart, if I had one, became heavier as he sank. The tear on my face vaporized by my heat. I know things would end like this at the beginning, what made me choose to ignore and pretend? I was never like this.   Maybe it is wrong at the beginning. Maybe I should not have noticed him that day. Maybe no mortal and god can last long. Maybe not the weak can be appreciated. Like Leto, he is just a sacrifice of jealousy, the price he pays for being a mortal. No need to be cried for.  Power is the only useful one in this world.    For sure, I have no heart, because it lies there, within that purple and red.   ";;;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule;1;0;0;0;rule

I followed the trunk down and saw the trail of sticks and leaves that laid sprawled across Gaea's floor. And finally, the blood that dripped from my chin and onto the ground. A strangely familiar person was lying in my lap. She looked older than me, with long glossy brown hair. She was as tan as I was too. We looked related almost.. When I grow up I want to look like her.  Every breath she took sent a puff of smoke in the air. I noticed there was a large amount of blood soaking her shirt. Trembling, I lifted it up carefully and found a nasty gash on her abdomen as well as claw marks over her heart. I looked around once more, seeing if there was anything I could use to help with her wounds. Something I can use to stop the bleeding at least. It seemed as if every second I wasted made the body become heavier and heavier. Her eyebrows were scrunched together. It seemed like she was dreaming. Grabbing a handful of random leaves (the ones still intact at least), I pressed it against her stomach and closed my eyes. I had no clue as to what I was doing. The only thing replaying in my head was a desperate wish for her to get better, for her wounds to heal. I prayed for her to get better, for her to wake up okay.  Almost instantly, her breathing began to change, it went from slow and labored breaths to deep and peaceful ones. I opened my eyes to find two curious brown ones staring back. Carefully, I removed the leaves from her stomach to find no wound painted on it. How is this even possible? Was it me? Looking at her, I asked, ""Are you okay?"" Finding my voice to be hoarse. She looked at me, confused, as if wondering the same things I was. Who she was and what we were doing in the middle of a forest. ""I don't know either,"" I said quietly, reading her expression. The girl got off my lap and sat up. She started to cough, concern filled my eyes. ""Is there anything to drink?"" She croaked out. I shook my head, closing my eyes. I imagined waterfalls, rivers, lakes...  I opened my eyes, looking back at her. Normally I would say I feel comfortable because we're both girls but I felt that there was something deeper... That we're tethered to each other somehow; Broken out of my trance I noticed a river in the distance behind her. I smiled, ""There! It's a river,"" She looked behind to where I pointed. I can't believe it hasn't frozen over yet! We both got up and rushed as fast as we could. My head felt like it was spinning as we ran but once I dipped my feet into the water I felt better. All of a sudden, my vision got clearer. The faint headache I felt coming on, disappeared. And my body felt stronger. I sat down, getting myself more comfortable in the water and played with the pebbles at the bottom. The different textures and patterns of their colors made them so alluring. I turned around to find the girl staring at the water strangely. She seemed almost afraid. How could anyone be afraid of this? Although it was freezing cold, it soothed me. Being in here felt like a breath of fresh air. I would have called her dumb if I hadn't gotten pulled in from behind.  My vision quickly grew dark and foggy as I sank deeper. The water stung my eyes as I slashed around, trying to get away from whatever was pulling me down. My hair was all over my face blocking my view, and the cold water that once felt comfortable started paralyzing my body. I wasn't sure what to do. Whatever was attacking me seemed almost invisible... but strong. Its presence reminded me of something inhuman... like a god. But why would a god harm me? Aren't they supposed to be good? Where's the surface? It's so dark now, have I been here for a while? Is the girl alright? She's alone. I have to get to her, ""Focus on yourself, you're the one in danger not her,"" A feminine voice said in my mind. She was quickly drowned out by more thoughts. Scrambling, I grabbed one of the biggest rocks I could find and swung it around me. It collided against whatever held me and I swiftly swam back up to the surface. Air finally filled my lungs and I wiped my eyes. I glanced around me, trying to find where I was. Then I saw her, she had passed out once again. Her eyebrows scrunched together as if she was having another bad dream. I crawled towards her, my body now sore from all the fighting in the water. My vision was blurred, and my head was ringing. Coughing harshly, I finally reached her. In an attempt to comfort her, I held her in my arms and gently swayed her like she was a baby. Doing so also comforted me, it reminded me of my mom, where is she...? Then I heard a twig snap behind me.  I looked around. Goosebumps, not only from the harsh wind, but from the feeling of being watched, appeared on my arms. Another pair of twigs snapped and I turned around to find a terrifying bear. The first thing I registered was its size. It was ten times bigger than I was. And I know I'm small but this bear was definitely abnormal. Something in my gut felt off as I noticed its eye, which was halfway from being gouged out. There was blood that was still drying trailing down its nose. It was unnerving. Their sharp pointed claws had blood on them too, I instantly thought back to the claw marks that were on the girl's chest. Realization had set in. Quickly, I scrambled away, pulling her body with me. The bear inched towards us slowly, almost like it was waiting to pounce at us. I looked around for a place to hide, to fight with, anything. Then I remembered the river that was near us. Maybe the thing that attacked me would go for the bear also. I pointed behind the bear and yelled ""Look over there!"" The bear turned away. Hastily, I dragged the girl's body behind bushes just outside of the riverbank and sprinted towards the water. The bear's head snapped back towards me instantly. Roaring at me, I yelled back,""Come at me! Are you scared or something?"" With no clue as to what I was doing, the only thing in my mind was how I needed the bear to follow me into the water. Maybe if I caught a fish and dangled it in front of it? But that wouldn't even work, the bear was looking at me like I was its new treat. The bear kept creeping closer and closer. And I stepped backwards deeper into the water in response. I ended up slipping on a loose rock and fell backwards on my butt. At this, the bear jumped at me, splashing the water in my face and scowling at me. Its fishy breath was in front of my face and smelled disgusting.  At the same time, something else pulled my hair and dragged me back into the water. A voice rang inside my head, ""Child, you must learn to put yourself first, now you will suffer,"" One moment I was about to get gnawed apart, now I was about to drown by some entity. Kicking strongly, I tried to get myself back up and away from the bear. My desperate attempts to pull back my hair from whatever it was caught on wasn't doing well... And as I saw the bear start clawing through the water, I knew I wasn't going to get out of here alive. I searched for a rock nearby to see if I could do what I did before but found nothing. The entity then latched itself onto my leg. Leaving nasty marks. Blood rapidly mixed with the water's color. I felt so sick. With the pain and the lack of air I couldn't think straight. I couldn't tell if the bear was even there anymore either.  I thought I was being smart but instead I dove into my own death. My life started to flash before my eyes. I saw a little girl, she looked happy, and she always had a bright smile on her face. The little girl then started to grow up. She celebrated her 12th birthday with her family... Had her first date with the cutest boy she ever met when she was 15... And then when she graduated she partied all night with her friends. She got her first job at her family's company. And from then on it got worse. She seemed tired all the time because of all the late nights. And her body looked as if she was skipping all her meals. In these flashes, I saw others as well. They seemed important considering the amount of times they surrounded her throughout her life. One of them was this woman. She didn't seem that tall but by how the girl always reacted, I assumed there was more to her than her appearance. She seemed animalistic, how she treated the girl compared to others. And the lazy eye she had looked disturbing, considering she had only half of it. It reminded me of the bear that was attacking me. As more memories flashed by, she began turning more and more sinister, like a monster.  Then I finally woke up. I stared up at the orange sky, noticing the giant snow covered trees once again. Immediately sitting up, I looked down at my body, to see how my leg looked. But I found nothing. Something feels off.. Where's the bear? My eyes then caught sight of the river. And the small child floating in the middle of it. My heart stopped, I scrambled out of the bushes and ran towards her. Once I finally reached her I pulled her towards me. I brushed the hair out of her face. Her brown eyes stared up towards the sky, lifeless. Her rosy cheeks now had no color to them, and her lips were stained blue. She looked like me, we look the same age too. That was when I realized..  She was me. I looked down at her leg, and was disgusted by the view of its large bleeding wound. Did I die? Am I all grown up now...? This is so confusing, who's body am I in? Is this my fault? Tears streamed down my face. Through my blurry vision I looked more at my own body, noticing how much bigger I was. I thought about the memories I had seen... and finally understood. She was my inner child. She tried to protect me. And now that she's gone I'm nothing but a dull adult. I should have protected her instead. Now her death is on my hands. I feel so empty, like I'm missing a part of myself. Crying, I closed her... my eyelids and folded her hands in the middle of her chest. The current of the river took her body away as soon as I nudged it out. Then I heard the feminine voice again, ""You have been warned, child. You must act now,"" Abruptly, I woke up. Everything was in my head... but the pain in my heart is still fresh. Finally, I figured it out, this entity was showing me what would happen if I don't start living for myself.     But... what entity?";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;0;0;1;rule

57165361;;;;;crew;;;;;;Zeus;;;;;;implied;;;;;"    Eurylochus led a handful of men to the edge of the ship, signaling them to dive in just as a wave crashes against the wooden ship. The threadbare shirt he wore did nothing to protect him from the freezing water, but that was the least of his worries.        He quickly took count of the men and began swimming to the front of the ship, trusting the others to follow. He took in a deep breath, forcing his heart to slow down, and went underwater, following the faint glow in the distance. His eyes stung, but blinking in the salty water didn't help.        He pushed through the current till he came face to face with the source of the glow; a woman-like creature, with canines too long to be human and scaled green twin-tails that flapped in the water.    He watched the furious expression at being confronted transform into a more familiar face,  Polites? , before he had his arms wrapped around the neck of the creature. Spines erupted along the tail, the siren thrashed, but he held steadfast, couting away the seconds till the figure stilled. He pushed upwards and thankfully gulped in the night air.        He waited a few sseconds, and the others too emerged from the water. He brought up the rear as they crowded near the ladder, waiting for Odysseus' next command. He could barely tell what was happening above deck, but through the broken reflections in the water, he pieced together the image of his queen, Penelope.        He drank in the sight of his best friends' wife for a few serene moments, memories of their family and him and Polites from before the war flooding his mind before the shadow of a man waved from the top of a ship. Eurylochus drew the knife, steeled his guts and dived once more. He focused on those sweet, sweet memories of his family as he cut the tails of the unconcious sirens floating near the ship.             Half an hour later, he stood on the deck, still shivering slightly as he removed the beeswax from his ears. Odysseus was stoicly staring out into the night sky, melodramatic ass that he was.        ""So?"" Eurylochus asked the obvious.       ""The lair of Scylla. That's how we get out of Poseidon's grasp.""       And just like that, all previous humour vanished. ""So, we do the impossible. Just another day then?""        Odysseus looked apologetic, but still nodded, unwavering in his decision. They stayed silent after that till the sky lightened ever-so-slightly to allow Eurylochus to make out Odysseus' thoughtful frown.          ""You're quiet today.""       ""Not much to say."" His voice was gravelly, tired, but then again, whose wasn't? Eurylochus did not inquire further.          The silence grew, but Eurylochus could feel it growing closer, stifling him till he breathed out through his mouth and spoke up, ""I've got a secret I can no longer keep.""        The guilt, of not just lies, but of all the blood on his hands, was squeezing, choking him. Odysseus barely looked at him, but his slightly tense body told him he was listening.           ""I opened the wind bag while you were asleep."" There. Those simple words for betrayal of trust of his closest friend.        Odysseus just shook his head. ""Why?""          Anger would have been better. Anger would have been appreciated. Eurylochus knew anger. He knew the blinding rage and hurtful words and stabbing pain and he knew to relish the soft, sharp hurt it brought with it. But dissapointment? The twisting in his heart it caused was worse.          ""I'm so sorry."" Eurylochus whispered. ""Forgive me."" And Odysseus nodded and that was that.        Eurylochus did not want to start to decipher the dark look in Odysseus' eyes, the strange hunger present alongside the familiar guilt of leading your own men to death. They sat silent once more, and Eurylochus felt the rising tension as though he was waiting for his verdict.        Odysseus finally simply walked away, ordering Eurylochus in a cold voice, ""Eurylochus, light up six torches."" He did as he was told, eyeing the way the flame raced up the liquid-doused wood and flickered violently. He handed them out to his own men, relishing the little warmth it provided.           The ship sailed on, and men came up and down the deck as guard duty shifts changed. Eurylochus lingered by the edge of the ship, eyeing the horizon once more.        ""Captain. Somethign approaches."" A darkness that had nothing to do with the night towered in the distance, and Eurylochus' heartbeat sped up once more.  Its just another battle , he thought to himself, gripping the leather-wrapped hilt of his sword till tiny crescent-shaped nail marks were permanently carved into it.  He met the eyes of his men around him, those holding the torches as well as those behind them.          ""Hello."" The deep growl had Eurylochus' stomach curling, some ancient part of him telling him to run, to flee, to save himself. He stood his ground as the monster wailed, the voice echoing around the cave and giving the illusion of multiple beings.        ""Row."" Odysseus shouted, eyes widening in fright. ""Row for your lives.""        Eurylochus repeated the words to those at the oars, and that shook then out of their trance.        "" Drown in your sorrow and your fears. ""        The chill to Eurylochus' core had nothing to do with the wind. "" Choke on your blood and your tears .""        Eurylochus peered around the dark, both looking for and not wanting to find the speaker. "" Bleed till you've run out of years. ""        No one made a single noise as they rowed, everybody stiller than they had been in the wooden horse in Troy. "" We must do what it takes to survive .""        Eurylochus held his breath, Odysseus doing the same beside him. A sudden groan to their left was followed by the booming voice.        "" Give up your honour and faith. Live up your life as a wraith. Die in the blood where you bathe. ""           Eurylochus swallowed the sudden tide of guilt as the words hit his heart, but still, they seemed directed at Odysseus. He was looking into the darkness without fear, something even Eurylochus was reluctant to do.           Another groan in front of them, and Eurylochus ducked when something came out of the water and wrapped itself around the man to Eurylochus's right holding a flaming torch. The shrill scream pierced through the veil of darkness before the man was dragged underwater by that monstrous appendage.        Eurylochus stifled a shout of terror and instead huddled closer to the floor.        Demetrius, another one of his men, stood near him, holding the torch aloft. He bent and joined Eurylochus on the floor.        ""Extinguish it."" Eurylochus ordered in a harsh whisper. Demetrius smiled sadly. The torch flickered in the dry summer wind, shadows bouncing around Demetrius' face creating the illusion of a watery grin.       Eurylochus could see his steadfast eyes, though. The eyes of a man not afraid to die. ""I command it.""        Demetrius shrugged as well as he could while lying face down and holding up a torch. ""I'm sorry. We both knew this was long coming.""          ""No. Demetrius I get that- Andreas-""       Demetrius held his spare hand up. The shadows looming just out of reach of the torch seemed to grow closer. A dread that had permanently taken up home in his mind grew once more.        ""I may not see Andreas again, or Polites, but sacrificing myself for my crew, my king? Why, brother, that's the best kind pf death, isnt it?""           Eurylochus wanted to scream, to tell him to drop the torch in the water, to hold him down till he followed, but Demetrius got up, dusting himself off flippantly. Eurylochus could still see the slight tremble of his hands.        Before he could shout, could do anything, the stupid, brave man walked forward, steering well clear of the huddled groups of men. He waved the fire around, and the sudden focus of the monster on his person was palpable.       Demetrius turned and met Eurylochus' eyes one final time, apologetic, scared, but so obviously relieved too. With tears in his eyes and a grin on his face, Demetrius raised the torch high like a flag, closing his eyes, water trailing down his face, as Scylla dragged him to the depths of the ocean.           The rest of his men carry the damning torch seemed to realise the inevitability of the situation and, much to Eurylochus' horror, by silent agreement, another man followed Demetrius' lead, offering himself up as easy sacrifice.        Bile rose in Eurylochus' throat. His gut threatened to turn, and he swallowed his nausea, sobbing silently.        He met their eyes each time in the dark, his sense of duty preventing him from dishonoring his men by doing otherwise. His eyes blurred, but he steadfastly looked at them, returning their small salutes with his own.          After an eternity in the dreamlike terror, all the torches had been extinguished by water, and with it went all forms of light. Eurylochus was shaking. He huddled closer to himself, the overwhelming utter helplessness catching in his throat and joining the shame in his heart.  The swirling hurt and guilt expanded outwards and, as they emerged into the open night sky, sharpened into something red hot and ugly.        Odysseus was at his side as always. His stricken expression melted into a blank mask as his eyes slid to Eurylochus', but he knew what to look for this time, and saw this too was an act for his benefit.              The sky outside was a slowly lightening blue, the setting moon turning the world to grey. Slowly, the men uncurled and got up, and those who had taken cover under the deck cautiously emerging up top.        Odysseus offer him an arm up, and Eurylochus took it, probably gripping it too tight to be comfortable. He stared at the hollow eyes and tried to get the panic in his chest under control.        What happened to you , he thought, running his gaze over the other man, scared to see someone he didnt recognise if he looked too close. Out of the two, Eurylochus had always been the harsher one. The carrot, the stick and the brains and charm. Polites, himself and Odysseus. He barely knew who any of them were anymore.          Eurylochus balled his fists, digging his nails in flesh. ""Tell me you did not know that would happen.""        His voice mercifully did not tremble. Odysseus released his arm.        ""Say you didn't know how this would end."" He was avoiding his eyes, Eurylochus realised, and it was like a bucket of cold water was dumped on his heart.        ""Look me in the eyes,"" he pleaded. ""And tell me, Captain."" That dark gaze look turned to him, and Eurylochus felt spark that expanded into something big between them every second their eyes met. His breathing was quick, tear tracks drying on his face, but no fear, only the chorus composed of guilt and denial and his ever present anger.        ""That you did not just sacrifice six men."" His voice was a roar by the end. Odysseus calmly met hus eyes, but beyond his own reflection in the gleaming iris, he could see the crumbling walls and Odysseus desperately holding on to the same anger he was.        ""Use your wits and try and say I'm crazy and mad."" The one time he would not mind being proven wrong by Odysseus. He was pleading his oldest friend, his brother and king. Fresh tears burned his flesh and left him bare in their wake, something raw struck as Odysseus refused to look away, both sensing the approaching disaster but stared, transfixed by the cracking of bonds forged through time and war and disaster and loss. ""That this is all some trick the gods have sent.""           ""Tell me."" His voice broke. He continued despite the glass in his throat that cut him down from the inside with every word. ""That you did not miss home so painfully bad, that you gave up the lives of six of our friends."" Eurylochus spit out the words with disgust, not sure if it hurt more to blame himself or to blame his brother.          Every second Odysseus remained silent, another part of Eurylochus disintegrated into nothingness till only a bitter husk remained.        ""When we fought the cyclops, you were quick to hatch a plan. And when we fought Circe, even when I wanted to save ourselves, it was you who left behind no man. ""          ""But when we fought this monster,""  as if they'd actually raised arms against Scylla , ""We didn't take a stand."" He scoffed, trying to channel myriad of emotions through his words rather than his fists. ""You just ran.""  Like a coward , went unsaid. But not just a coward, no. He let their friends, the men who had followed his every word for ten years with full trust in his abilities to get them home, drop like flies to save his own life.        ""Say something."" He yelled, voice rough with emotion.          ""I can't."" Finally, the man snapped.          Eurylochus uncurled his hand and curled it again around his sword, a gift from Odysseus that he had used to defend his king for years, and cut off the final part of himself still clinging to his soul.        ""Then you have forced my hand.""          Ruthlessness is mercy upon our selves . The words floated up through the swirling fire that were his thoughts.        Fine, then . He settled into a fighting stance, feet apart and sword pointed at Odysseus' bare neck. He could see a vein visibly thump under his skin.           ""Lower your weapon."" The harsh words of someone who knew he would be listened to. Eurylochus went against every instinct screaming in his body.          ""No can do. You miss your wife so bad, youd trade the lives of your own crew.""          ""Dont make me fight you brother."" Odysseus frowned, but his hands still did not creep towards his own sword. ""You know you'd have done the same.""          ""If you want all the power, you must carry all the blame."" Eurylochus threw Odysseus' own words back, voice filled with venom.          Odysseus did not raise his sword even as Eurylochus drew closer. A wave of distaste filled Eurylochus at the arrogance, and he finally attacked, sword swiping through the air where Odysseus had been a moment ago. The sound of a sword being removed from a scabbard rang and Odysseus dodged and turned, arms raised defensively.       Eurylochus charged again, Odysseus parrying with relative ease. He pushed again and again, increasing the force behind each slash, his mind running through every trick in the book to find an opening. Odysseus did not allow him that, clashing swords till a bead of sweat dripped from his brow.           Their breaths puffed, but Eurylochus did not allow a moments respite, stabbing at his shoulder. Odysseus ducked and twirled, a leg hooking around Eurylochus'. He  twisted , and Eurylochus fell to his knees.        His heart missed a beat, but he recovered, tossing his own sword aside to wrestle the smaller man in the close quarters.        A punch landed on his face, blood gurgling down his mouth, and Eurylochus smirked, teeth covered in iron red. He snapped his head, meeting Odysseus' cheek bones with a satisfying crack. To his credit, Odysseus did not yell, instead just backed away and finally, finally began attacking with renewed vigour.           They traded blows back and forth, bloodlust in both their veins. Eurylochus grew desperate, his muscles cramping from the sudden activity. This man had built and torn down his entire life. He was at the centre of each moment in Eurylochus' existence, and it was only now that he saw who they truly were.  Monsters .          He took a gamble, faking an attack to his shoulder. Odysseus' was quicker, running on pure adrenaline, and a well aimed blow had Eurylochus doubling over. The next second, a cool metal pressed against his throat, hard enough to sting but not to draw blood.           ""I am not letting you get in my way."" Odysseus said, drawing a line of red on his neck, and Eurylochus noticed Odysseus' eyes. Wild. Desperate. A dog squaring against a bear, losing all semblance of humanity till only the desire to survive remained. Eurylochus swallowed, throat bobbing against his sword.           Odysseus was leaning over him, close enough for Eurylochus to smell the sharp sting of sweat and blood, the familiar scent of war. His eyes were hidden in shadow, a small cut on his cheekbone streaked red. He nodded his head ever so slightly as the sharp edge pressed harder, preventing him from breathing.        Blood sprayed over Eurylochus first. Odysseus staggered backwards, eyes wide as his hands came bloody from his stomach. He looked at Eurylochus in horror, then behind him, at Gregory, one of Eurylochus' men, holding a knife dripping with his own blood.        ""My brothers."" He croaked, before collapsing to his knees with a dull thud. ""Why?"" The haunted voice whispered before Eurylochus quickly knocked his sword hilt against his Odysseus' temple.        His eyes closed, face relaxing, making him look much younger. Eurylochus stood, one arm holding his sword, and met Gregory's eyes.        ""Tie him up. We sail to the nearest land."" The crew seemed uneasy, but no one argued.                    Odysseus came to with a groan. He tried to shield his eyes from the blinding light, sunsequently realising his hands were tied. He slowly opened his eyes, blinking rapidly till they adjusted to the midday sun. A dark shadow sat at his side, and Odysseus greeted his closest friend with a nod, regretting the decision a moment later. He groaned at a stab of pain. ""My head.""       Eurylochus merely stared at him, eyebrows furrowed but eyes cold. ""Where are we?"" He asked, looking around intrestedly at the picture perfect scenery. Blue skies, lush green grounds. A rocky beach and dense forest. A few men sat around in groups, looking out of place with their worn and dirt-covered clothes and weapons in the beautiful landscape. He thought he heard the mooing of a cow somewhere, but craning his neck to find it was also a bad idea. A much sharper pain pierced his side. A stab wound, hurting like hell but dressed in clean bandages. Eurylochus' work, if he had to guess.           ""Some island."" Eurylochus replied, a distraction from the pain Odysseus readily accepted. ""The first one we could find.""    ""It's bursting with cows."" Eurylochus added, frowning. A little redundantly, if you asked Odysseus. He could hear the mooing just as well. A cow strolled into view, and Odysseus raised his eyebrows appreciatively at the giant animal with soft eyes and shining white fur, before noticing the hungry look in Eurylochus' eyes as he considered the cattle before him.        Odysseus' stomach growled as if on cue, though maybe that was just his insides trying to recover from the being stabbed. ""They are just roaming about. There are no people here. There's just so much meat.""           Odysseus' stomach was empty, hadn't been completely filled in months, but their encounter with the lotus-eaters had taught him better.        ""Eurylochus."" He said urgently. ""Don't. You know there is no way this ends well. We- our men could be die."" Eurylochus snorted, and Odysseus had to admit the derision was well deserved.        ""Look, I'm sorry. But there was no other way.""           Eurylochus ignored his apology. ""There is no other food here either, nor is there anything in the ocean. We have nothing left. And hunger is so heavy.""        Odysseus' heart softened at seeing Eurylochus in pain for a moment, before his head thrummed, reminding him how he had been knocked out. The haze in his mind prevented any clear thoughts.           Eurylochus looked at him, shoulders drooping, before noticing something on his face and joining him on the grassy ground.        ""You're bleeding."" He said, pouring what was possibly the last bit of alcohol still remaining on his head wound. Odysseus hissed but did not move as Eurylochus wrapped a bandage around his head. He sat heavily beside Odysseus, leaning against the tree. He could maybe reach a knife on Eurylochus' belt, cut himself out, but his warning glare had Odysseus settling once more. He had no crew, no food. Not even a fully functioning body. Couldn't do much at the moment.       Eurylochus' gaze returned to the cows milling about, and Odysseus could see him fantasizing eating them.        ""There's really no one here?"" Odysseus asked; his turn to distract Eurylochus from doing something they would regret. Eurylochus regarded him for a moment.        ""Just a statue of the lord of the sun."" He answered. ""Don't nt know where its from, but the cows seem attracted to it.""          A warning bell sounded in Odysseus' brain, some legend about Apollo and cows that Athena had told him on a lazy afternoon as they relaxed after a lesson in his youth, but he could not, for the life of him, maybe literally, remember the foggy memories through his haze. He silently cursed Eurylochus.          Eurylochus got up suddenly, grabbing his sword and decidedly unsheathing it. ""Eurylochus, wait.""       The larger man stilled. ""Please don't ont tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do."" Odysseus said softly. Eurylochus turned to face him, and Odysseus could have sobbed at the look of pure devastation on his brother's face.        ""Ody, we're never going to get to make it home, you know it's true.""           A piece of Odysseus' heart shattered. The defeat in Eurylochus' voice had his gut twisting.        ""You don't know that's true."" Eurylochus hunched further, but made no move to leave. ""This is the home of the sun god."" He tried to argue.          ""I'm starving my friend."" Eurylochus said it so matter-of-factly, his voice devoid of any previous anger, that Odysseus flinched.        ""If you kill his cattle, who knows what he'll send."" He stated quietly.        Eurylochus' dark eyes met his own. ""I'm tired, my friend.""        ""But we're so close to home."" Odysseus pleaded, softly tugging against the ropes binding him. ""This can't be where it ends.""        ""You see a light at the end of the tunnel, Odysseus. I don't. No matter what, i am not getting Polites, my men, back."" Odysseus swallowed roughly.        ""How much longer must we suffer now?"" Eurylochus asked rhetorically, and Odysseus wished he had an answer.        ""Please don't do this."" All he could do was beg.        ""How much longer should we push through doubt?""        ""I need to get home, Eurylochus.""        ""How much longer should I go about my life like this?""        ""Eurylochus.""        ""When people die like this?""        ""We can get you home.""        ""I have no home left. Not anymore.""        ""Eurylochus. I'm sorry.""        ""I'm just a man."" Eurylochus said, and got up once again. The set in his shoulders was definite as he stalked towards his prey, and Odysseus tugged harder at his bonds.           The sun shining on Odysseus' face left him able to only see the dark silhouettes. Eurylochus' sword raised, and Odysseus shouted, ""Eurylochus, no!"", just as he brought it down with a powerful swing.           The red blood arced through the air, gleaming like stained glass against the sun midair, before splattering against the ground. The world hung silent for a few moments.       Odysseus whispered in horror, throat parched, ""You've doomed us.""           Eurylochus looked back up at him. ""You've doomed us all, Eurylochus."" He yelled, fury bursting forth like water through a dam.        What had he done?  I have to get back. To Penelope, to Telemachus.  Odysseus thought distantly, and that single thought propelled him. He tugged desperately against the ropes holding him back, ignoring the pain it brought, and with a final crack, they snapped.           ""Captain?"" Eurylochus reproachfully asked, lowering his sword.          ""We need to get away from this island."" Odysseus yelled. Crashing noises came from deep within the forest, a deep groan as the earth below their feet shifted. ""Now.""           The cows ran about, panicking, but by some miracle the men avoided getting hit as everyone ran to the ship as fast as legs allowed.           ""Grab an oar with all the strength your arms allow."" Odysseus reached the top of the ladder and hit the ground rolling. He clambered to his feet, approaching Eurylochus.           ""These cows were immortal."" He snapped. Eurylochus watched him with wide eyes. ""They were the sun god's friend.""        The anchor was pulled up, and ship slowly got off the beach as the final line of trees crashed into the ground with a resounding crack. ""And now that we've pissed them off,"" Odysseus snarled, staring up into Eurylochus' horror-drawn face and shouting, ""Who do you think they'll send?""        Eurylochus took a step back. ""Full speed ahead."" He yelled, officially wrestling back control of his men from Eurylochus' short reign.        Odysseus' heart hammered in his chest, anticipation and adrenaline twisting and overriding all feelings. ""Faster"" he yelled, looking behind them for any signs of a threat. The sky around them darkened. ""Faster."" The waves were beating against the side of the ship. Wind howled, and the smell of ozone reached Odysseus first. Thunder crashed, lightning blinding him for a moment before he realised there was someone standing in front of them.        ""We're too late."" He whispered, the throbbing of his brain loud in his ears, or maybe that was his heartbeat. One moment passed, the world remained frozen, and the next, all his men were standing behind the lord of the skies.             Odysseus dropped to his knees, kneeling as he set his sights on the king of the gods' corpeal form for the first time. He still had nightmares about the rumbling voice from the last time they had met. He could not stop the building dread in his gut.        Zeus smirked at him, cruel eyes glinting. He held a lightning bolt in his hands, and Odysseus shivered under the mere presence of the weapon used to slay titans.        ""Pride is a damsel in distress."" Began the king of gods. His voice like the rolling of thunder, the god miracled himself a huge, golden throne in the middle of the ship and settled into it, legs spread under the royal purple toga. Odysseus stood frozen, not daring to look away from the god in front of him. If it was any other time, Odysseus might have been in awe. As it was, he did his best to not move, lest he attract the famed wrath of Zeus. ""Hiding away where only I can undress her.""           The king cupped one hand around something in the air, and an ornate, silver goblet shimmered into existence. ""Try all she can not to confess. In the end, its all the same once I apply all the pressure.""           Odysseus mused distantly why Zeus was telling him this. Was it a lesson, or a comparison. Was he being too prideful? He wondered.           Zeus looked away from his drink, apparently finished with the speech, and raised a surprised eyebrow at Odysseus still kneeling on the ground. ""Get up."" He vaguly waved his ring adorned hand. Odysseus stood, knees creaking.           ""Tell me, Odysseus."" Zeus rumbled. Odysseus would not have been surprised if his heart had stopped in that moment. ""If I were to make you chose; the lives of your men and crew, or your own. Why do I think they'll lose?""          Zeus took a sip of the golden liquid with a satisfied sigh, before tipping the goblet in Odysseus' direction. ""Enlighten me, king of Ithaca. Since hunger was far too great, I wonder who'd take the weight of the damned and suffer a gruesome fate.""        ""You made a grievious error, son of Laeretes. You insulted the gods, my son, no less, and expected your act of crime to go unpunished?"" He asked, bushy eyebrows frowning incredulously.       ""Choose.""          ""Choose?"" Odysseus breathed out, voice shaky and tight with emotion.          ""Someone has to die today. You, or your crew? You have the final say, king of Ithaca.""          The king looked back at him, deep blue eyes filled with dark amusement. ""So, choose."" A slight smirk twisting his lips, Zeus gulped the rest of his nectar and sat back, eyes hooded dark with power.           ""Please, don't make me do this."" He begged, tears in his eyes. The same words he had uttered when given the choice to kill Hector's son or to never see his family. The first time, it had been his family or the child.     Now, it was him or his men.  I can't let them die,  he thought desperately.          Zeus said nothing, simply lounging on his chair, fingers trailing along the body of the lightning bolt. An immortal, all-powerful deity, forcing Odysseus to make impossible choices, for what? Entertainment? Some twisted feeling of power? Odysseus pushed the thoughts out of his racing mind.          Choose? He could choose to save his own hide, to return to his dearest Penelope, to his sweet Telenachus, to go home and be happy? Or he could choose his men. The thirty six men who he had sworn to protect. Men who had given their everything to him for over twelve years, who were his citizens and his army and his family.           In the end, there was only one option.             Eurylochus' voice pierced through the darl veil of thoughts. ""Captain?""       ""I have to see her, Eurylochus."" Odysseus begged him to understand. He wondered if the other man was thinking about the conversation between them and Polites after the first time he met zeus. How overcome by guilt he had been, how close to the tipping off the ledge.  Now, look at the pair of them , he thought darkly.  Killers. Traitors.          ""But we'll die."" The quiet whisper would haunt him for the rest of his life. Odysseus looked away, not wanting to see the tears on his mens' face.        Eurylochus stubbornly stared at him, pulled his into the swirling darkness of his tearful eyes, and a thousand unsaid words passed between them in that instant.        ""I know."" He said, shaking with silent sobs.  I know you'll die. I know you're sorry. I know I'm a monster.  Tears refused to stop flowing down his face.          Odysseus was falling, and for the first time, he didn't know what to do. His heart twisted, guilt crashing down upon him in waves that had him shivering. He dug his fingers into arm, hard enough to provide momentarily relief, before a new wave of pain washed over him as he looked over the men who had followed him to literal hell. Tired eyes, broken figures. Not a single dry eye.  I'm sorry.  Empty words that would change nothing.          Zeus, seeming unaware of Odysseus' inner bdnd, sat up on his chair.        ""Well, this has been fun."" He rose to his full glory, using the lightning bolt as a cane as he got to his feet, robes swishing under some unseen wind. ""I wish you luck, king of Ithaca. You will need it. Until next time.""           The king of the gods waved his hand, and the world disappeared around Odysseus. ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
56347633;;;;;unknown Hightowers;;;;;;Melinoe;;;;;;unknown;;;;;"Melinoe is the goddess of nightmares and madness. She can speak and control the ghosts that reside in the mortal world. She has spent centuries helping her father, but desires something different. Melinoe has been watching the past, present, and future of the Targaryens. She has also sent them nightmares to warn them.   Melinoe looked up to where her father sat. ""Have you heard of the Targaryen's?""  ""The idiots who worship the weak gods. It's quite amusing when their souls pass through here instead of wherever they believe they do. As if their gods are as powerful as us,"" Hades sneered.  The goddess of nightmares nodded and feigned innocence and curiosity. ""Anything interesting happening there?""  Her father looked at her and sighed. ""Whatever you're thinking the answer is no.""  ""Come on! I'm so bored here. It's the same routine every day for thousands of years! It's getting tiring to torment people here,"" Melinoe complained.  ""Why don't you visit Olympus?"" He said absentmindedly.  Melinoe disappeared, black smoke surrounding her body and reappeared right in front of her father's throne. ""That got boring 200 years ago! and Uncle Zeus has banned me for turning him into a fish.""  The room had went silent and Hades was staring at his daughter in stunned silence. Melinoe just smile innocently. Her uncle Zeus absolutely hated the sea. And he obviously didn't take being a fish in his brother's territory well. At all. Instead Melinoe was banned from the heavens, the seas, and Athens. Her cousin Athena didn't like how she tormented the mortals with ghosts. Or madness. But what else is she supposed to do if not torment beings that are below her?  Hades burst out laughing, startling Melinoe. She stared at him with a hint of disbelief. He was always brooding that seeing him smiling was both scary and relieving.  Was it really so bad that she wanted something different? She just really wanted to see the dragons in person. And to see if there was more entertainment than here.  ""So is that a yes? Please! If you don't agree I will make the Underworld my personal playground,"" she glared. They both knew she was being serious and Hades didn't really care. He loved his daughter but it would be nice for the Underworld to have some quiet.   ""Go ahead daughter. But at the first sign of real trouble, you come right back.""  Melinoe held in her squeal and rushed to give her father a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Then she rushed to her room.  She really didn't need to pack anything, but she needs her onyx pendent so that the ghosts won't overload her. It was a birthday gift from her father. It was the one valuable object she has. When she had retrieved it she had stopped and looked down at herself. The thin dress she is wearing is half black and white, just like her hair. It was parted the same way as her hair which she always thought was pretty. Meaning she had white hair on the left and that part of the dress was also white. She also wore a light crown upon her head, showing her goddess status. Her eyes were pure white, a contrast to her abilities. Ironically, there was nothing light about her goddess powers. The white represented the afterlife. Represented the fact that there is life after death and where you go depends on the choices you make in your human life.    Melinoe was excited to finally see the dragons. There are of course dragons in the Underworld, but they're more... skeletal and dead looking. Which was pretty awesome, but she wanted to meet living ones.   Her cousin, Apollo, had been letting her see the future for the Targaryen's and had let her know now is the time. Melinoe really wanted to wait until they were killing each other but her cousin had always advised against it. He's of course no fun, but at least he assisted her.   Melinoe had disappeared to King's Landing, leaving behind only black smoke. She appeared to what looked like a funeral. She made sure she was invisible to the human eye and watched the proceedings. There seemed to already be a divide between the Greens and Blacks. Melinoe giggled when the man speaking had made a subtle insult to Rhaenyra's children. It seems these humans are as stuck up as Athena. Throughout the proceedings she couldn't help but notice the ghost that appeared pregnant and sad.   The ghost made eye contact with her and approached the Goddess. ""I'm ready.""  Melinoe smiled sadly and reached her hand out. ""May you and your child have peace in the Elysian Fields.""  The beautiful woman appeared brighter and smiled as she closed her eyes. The Goddess watched as her soul vanished and knew her mother would have a soul to take to paradise. Woman who die in childbirth deserve to be taken to the Elysian Fields.   The Goddess saw and felt the tension between the factions. It was hilarious to her that Alicent was obssessed with Rhaenyra. The pious woman hid behind her false gods and claimed to be virtuous. How silly.    Melinoe followed Rhaenyra but quickly went to someone else as Daemon approached her. She remembered watching that scene and didn't want to be apart of it. She gasped in excitement as she saw the little green boy approach the large dragon. How was this little boy not afraid?   The boy, Aemond, approached cautiously the Goddess saw the dragon eyeing him up. It was like the dragon was measuring his soul to see if he was worthy. It seemed to be a positive assessment when Aemond climbed on her back and flew into the sky.   ""I want to ride a dragon,"" Melinoe pouted. She wondered if there were any more dragons and went to look. She stopped in her tracks when she felt the presence of ghosts. There were so many that if it wasn't for her pendant, she would've collapsed. She let out a shaky breath and calmed herself.   Turning around, she walked in the direction of the castle. Her pace quickened when she heard crying and yelling. Finally!  She teleported to the room, becoming impatient with walking. She was a goddess, she wasn't going to do a mundane task like running. She saw Aemond with a bloody eye and Rhaenyra's child with a bloody nose. Children seem to be quite vicious.   Rhaenyra and Daemon came in, appearing disheveled and Melinoe laughed. They really couldn't have picked a better time. ""Who did this?""  ""They attacked me!"" ""He attacked Baela!"" ""He broke Luke's nose!"" ""He stole my mother's dragon!"" Melinoe heard all at once. She really tried to keep it in but at the last child's comment, she burst into laughter.   She broke through her glamour and startled everyone in the room by her laughing. When the guards looked at her eyes, they began to advance forward.  ""I wouldn't do that if I were you, mortals.""  They froze in their step and the false pious woman demanded to know who she was. Melinoe was bored of this woman already and all she did was demand an answer. I felt pity for those who had to listen to her. on a daily basis. ""I don't listen to mortals, but I am Melinoe, the Goddess of Nightmares and Madness.""  Everyone seemed to be frozen in shock, but I heard startled chuckles. You know, Melinoe didn't like being laughed at. It's quite an insult. Everyone watched as her eyes glowed a brighter white and how black smoke appeared out of her right hand. Their eyes followed the smoke and it revealed a familiar woman. A woman whose soul hadn't been taken yet.   Queen Aemma.  The children cried and hid behind their parents while the others watched on in horror. Queen Aemma approached her daughter who had silent tears streaming down her face. ""My sweet daughter. I am so proud of you and I will always love you.""  It seemed the Queen had finally found peace. Melinoe felt a heaviness in her arms and looked down to see a beautiful baby boy. She smile softly and called out to the dead Queen. ""Your soul is ready, Queen Aemma. And someone is waiting for you.""  The ghost turned to the Goddess and approached with a bright smile. She took the baby in her arms and turned to King Viserys, who looked as if he was going to be sick. The dead Queen thought of saying something to him, but knew it would hurt more if she was silent. She turned to the Goddess and indicated she was ready to go.  Melinoe once again reached her hand out, ""May you and your son roam the fields in Paradise. Don't worry, your other children are waiting.""  She disappeared slowly and Melinoe raised an eyebrow to the occupants in the room. The ones who wore green appeared to be terrified, while Rhaenyra appeared to be content. Melinoe approached the Heir to the throne. ""Don't worry, my mother will make sure Queen Aemma and her children will always be happy.""  Melinoe clapped her hands, shocking everyone out of their stupor. ""Now where were we?"" she out a hand on her chin before jumping and turning to Daemon's daughters. ""Oh I remember. No one can steal a dragon, child. If the dragon didn't deem Aemond as worthy, she wouldn't burnt him to a crisp.""  ""It wasn't his to take,"" the girl snapped. Daemon saw how annoyed the goddess was and gripped his daughter's shoulder to silence her. What awful manners this child has.   Melinoe chose to ignore the small mortal and approached Alicent. She could feel the eyes on her and she saw how the false Queen shook. Melinoe giggled as she caressed her face. ""You're going down a dark path, false Queen. And you will have no Gods to save you.""  The woman let out a gasp and clutched the pendent on her chest. ""Stop your lies! The Seven will protect me!""  ""Are humans always this amusing? Didn't you hear what I said? The Seven don't exist."" Before the Targaryen's can say anything, the Goddess raised a hand. ""The Valyrian gods exist, but they are weak compared to us. The magic of Valyria has almost run out.""  Everyone listened carefully to her words and had no choice but to believe her. She moved away from Alicent and walked towards the King. He was still looking at the spot where his dead wife was. Pathetic. ""And you. Viserys, the weak. When my brother and I sent those nightmares to you, you were meant to learn from them.""  The King snapped his eyes to the Goddess and went to protest. But she had interrupted him. ""Didn't you feel the dread every time you woke up? They were nightmares, you idiot. A son would bring the destruction of your family.""  Melinoe rolled her eyes and walked towards the center of the room and made eye contact with every single person. Her smile unnerved everyone and the children seemed to be the only ones not afraid of her. Interesting. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a sword coming at her head. She lifted her hand and stopped the sword and the person who held it. She slowly turned and saw it was the guard dog.   ""You're quite stupid aren't you? Prince Daemon. What did I say I was the goddess of?""  Prince Daemon smirked. ""The goddess of nightmares and madness, your divinity.""  ""That's correct. And as you've seen I can control ghosts."" Melinoe scoffed at the audacity and stepped back. ""Honestly, you're not worth it to be killed by a Goddess. In fact, I think there's someone here who would very much like to slit your throat.""  Daemon walked forward, but stopped when the Goddess held up a hand. ""Not you."" Her pure white eyes went to Rhaenyra. ""You. I'm sure you'd want the honors after how he treated your sons.""  The Goddess had thought she would say no, but Rhaenyra stood firm when Daemon gave her his dagger. Before Rhaenyra could do anything, a loud ""No!"" was heard. Everyone turned to see Alicent with Viserys' dagger going towards Rhaenyra's son, Lucerys.  Rhaenyra and Daemon were too far to stop her and all Rhaenyra could do was scream. She had stopped when she the Goddess standing in front of her son. Alicent's eyes went wide before the dagger pierced through the Goddess' chest. There was a moment where Alicent smiled with glee but it dropped when she saw the fury in those white eyes.  Melinoe chuckled darkly and gripped the false Queen by her neck. That seemed to catch the attention of the Green's and she could hear Alicent's father demanding to have the Goddess killed.   ""You know I came to the human world to ride a dragon and have fun, but now I will destroy the Green faction. I've never seen mortals so idiotic before and I will surely have a talk with Athena about her useless creatures,"" she seethed. Black smoke appeared and held the Green's in place. ""I cannot be killed as I am a Goddess. But the intent is still there.""  Melinoe gripped Alicent's throat tighter, making her try and claw her way out. The goddess leaned forward and gazed into her eyes. ""I will make sure your soul never finds peace. You will never see your mother or your children again.""  Alicent's eyes widened. ""Please don't kill my children! They did nothing wrong! I was at fault, don't punish them for my sins.""  Her children were tense and Melinoe can feel fear coming from them. ""Unlike you, I don't kill children. What I can do is have their minds erased so they will never remember you.""  That seemed to have broken her as she sobbed uncontrollable. Melinoe was annoyed by her cries and was quickly becoming bored. She squeezed her neck until she felt Alicent's life drain from her body. She let go of her and ran her hands over her dress, trying to ride herself of the mortal. Melinoe made eye contact with the ghost who was still crying. ""May your soul never find peace and let Hades deal with all of you.""  With those words, her soul disappeared along with every other green in the room. Melinoe knew her father would get the message and he wouldn't be please. Ignoring the mortals who were  watching her cautiously, she approached Aemond, Aegon, and Helaena. These poor children. She caressed each of their faces and felt a wave of sadness when each one of them flinched before leaning into her touch.   ""There's no need to be afraid anymore, little dragons,"" she said softly. ""Though I do have a gift for you. A gift of youth. It will erase your memories and give you a new start. Or you can have your memories erased and reside with Rhaenyra.""  Aemond and Aegon looked horrified at the last option. Aegon looked at the Goddess skeptically, ""If we take the.. gift who will raise and take care of us?""  Melinoe clapped her hands together and giggled. ""Great question, little dragon. Before I tell you, everyone who is not a Targaryen needs to leave the room.""  The room cleared so fast and it was amusing to see them trying not to trip over the bodies that covered the floor. When only Targaryen's remained, she spoke. ""Have you ever wondered why you can connect to dragons? It's because of the blood that runs through your veins. You are descended from the weak Gods and you have a very slim piece of divinity in you.""  She turned towards Aegon to answer his question. ""Because of the divinity in your blood, you can be raised by a god/goddess of your choice.""  Gasps were heard and Viserys chose now to grow a spine. ""You cannot just take my children.... your divinity.""  ""Father, shut up,"" Rhaenyra snapped. She was pale, but anyone can see she was relieved. ""Did you not see what happened to half of the people in this room? It seems you'd like to join mother as fast as you can.""  Melinoe snorted and covered her mouth. Heads turned to her and she cleared her throat, trying to stop the laugh that wanted to crawl it's way out of her throat. ""Oh, child. Your father will never enter the Elysian Fields.""  Viserys looked as if he was going to be sick. He knew that meant he'd never see his wife again. ""I don't understand.""  The goddess feigned sadness and sighed, ""Let me put it this way. In your quest for a male heir, which you ignored my warnings about, you killed 6 children and your wife. Because Queen Aemma had become with child so young and had no rest between pregnancies, her body wasn't strong enough. And whose fault is that? Yours.""  Melinoe enjoyed his gasps of pain as he realized the consequences to his actions. She couldn't help but dig the knife deeper. ""Queen Aemma is with her 6 children in Paradise. And you. Will. Never. See her. Again.""  He broke down sobbing and collapsed to his knees. Don't worry, he didn't die. It's not his time, yet. Melinoe ignored him and turned back to Aemond, Helaena and Aegon. ""Do you have an answer, little dragons?""  She expected them to be frightened of her. After all, she did kill their mother and grandfather. Oh, can't forget she killed their guard dog too. What a waste of space those mortals were.   When she met their eyes, they were full of hope. Maybe a little bit of distrust. Helaena was the first to speak. ""I accept. And I think you know who I would choose, your divinity.""  Melinoe smiled softly at the little seer. ""My cousin, Apollo, would be honored to raise you as his daughter.""  The seer smiled widely and hugged the goddess. Melinoe froze, but quickly returned the embrace. Maybe children aren't so bad to have.   The goddess looked to Aemond and Aegon who looked even more hopeful. They both agreed to the gift, but Aemond wanted the Goddess to choose for him. Melinoe thought about the temperament of the boy. Her beloved cousin, Ares, loved his children. He might've been bloodthirsty but there was nothing he wouldn't do for his kids.   ""The god of war would be a great choice for you, Aemond. I see how fierce you will become and Ares will love and protect you,"" she mused.   A scoff was heard and Melinoe turned to Daemon with an amused look on her face. ""Is there a problem, Prince Daemon?""  He stiffened and the smirk dropped from his face. It seems he forgot who was in the room with him. His daughter's hid behind him, fearing the Goddess would harm their father for speaking out. ""The Hightower's don't deserve this honor, your divinity. They should join their kin.""  Rhaenyra gasped and turned to her uncle with a look of horror. Before she could defend her siblings, the Goddess did it for her. ""They are children who were raised to believe you and Rhaenyra would kill them. And it seems like they had a right to be concerned as you just threatened them.""  She stepped towards the man and enjoyed how he tensed. She was significantly shorter than him, but that didn't stop the fear Daemon felt. ""It's funny how you seem to forget they are still your blood. They even have dragons they are bonded to. Your hatred for them is unwelcome and childish.""  Melinoe dismissed him and turned to Aegon who looked at her in awe. ""Do you have anyone in mind, Aegon? Though with your love for the arts, Apollo would be a great choice.""  Aegon immediately shook his head. He looked bashfully at the Goddess before mumbling something even she couldn't understand. Melinoe smiled encouragingly at him, ""Go ahead and say it.""  ""Can you do it? I mean can you raise me as your own?"" He blurted. The goddess looked at him in surprise and contemplated it. Normally she'd say no, but she has come to the conclusion that children aren't so bad. Besides, she can teach him how to torment her father.   Melinoe smiled in delight, but frowned. "" I would love to, but I'm not perfect Aegon. I can be a bit of a nuisance sometimes and I don't think I would be a good mother.""  ""Will you hit me? Or insult me?""  The goddess looked at him appalled, ""Of course not!""  ""Then I want you to be my mother,"" Aegon demanded.   Melinoe clapped excitedly and brought the three in for a hug. ""I am excited! It's been soooo long since there have been small children around! I can't wait to terrorize the Pantheon!"" And with that exciting thought in mind, all 4 of them disappeared in a puff of black smoke.       ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
40607286;;;;;Tecmessa;;;;;;unknown;;;;;;unknown;;;;;"Eurysaces, the name means broad shield. That's what my brother named this child. This cute one is now four years old and he lost his father. His father's death is sad but the most miserable thing is, that he left us by his own hand. And that was my fault.     The day he died I went to Mysia and fought until the team get enough goods and return. After I came back, I was shocked when people surround me immediately and curse me to die. Before I ask what happened, someone grabbed my hair harshly and said, Ajax killed all cattle and lambs then fled.  ""He's gone now, so you're the one who should pay.""  ""Die, you traitor!""  My mind was hazed. I was busy escaping death. Yes, soldiers try to crush me with rocks. When I nearly lay on the land and breath heavily, old kings stopped them. I remember Idomeneus get me up and head to the council. Sons of Atreus denounced me roughly but when Calchas put his hands on my shoulder and whispered, his words are all I concerned about.  ""My son, Fate is not doomed yet. You still have time, but you must move fast.""  ""He's alive?""  ""Yes, but hurry before fates take him.""  He swift me and I ran. No, sons of Atreus blocked me. I need to go, I demand them to let me go but they said I can't. They accused me that I'm a traitor. They said me and my brother planned to kill kings and leave Troy with treasures. I was nervous to imagine losing Ajax and was desperate to go find him, so I sent Alastor instead. After sending him first, I got out of the camp as quickly as I could and ran. My breath gets heavier and sharp pain stabbed my lungs.  Finding Ajax wasn't difficult. I heard Tecmessa's shrill cry from the shore. All my hope shattered poorly. Fates took him.  I cried a lot. I didn't know how to stop crying at that time. Friends told me that I was almost passed out when I first saw his corpse. They help me get up and expect orders from me. At first, I didn't know what to do. I look around and notice Eurysaces isn't here. I gasp. Breath sharply, I almost shouted.  ""Where's Eurysaces?""  Tecmessa quickly takes her son here, where her husband and her child's father lay. My brother's corpse. While my friends told me what happened during my absence, all my mind was fixed on Tecmessa and Eurysaces. I can't take my eyes off from them. To see them crying makes my heart hurt.  ""Did he leave any will?""  ""...Ajax said you will be the child's protector. He wanted you to take him to Salamis. To king Telamon,"" Pandion said.  To Salamis.  ""I see. Anything else?""  Pandion shakes his head. So, that's all. Duty has fallen.     It's a hard thing to take care of a child. Especially after a battle. Every time I go out for battle, I fear that I could die immediately even before leaving my will. After my brother's death, I pray to the gods every day. I wasn't faithful before but things changed.  I must be safe until I took Tecmessa and her child to Salamis. Protecting a woman and child during this endless war is a hard quest. There are many enemies in here, in our ally. Taunt, despise, rape, disregard, assault, I know these very well. They were never stranger during my childhood. After all those years, I still remember everything so vividly. How can I forget? But the child in front of me, and the woman who's sick right now are in a worse situation than mine. And I should protect them. Not just because it's Ajax's will, but I wanted to since I first saw them.  Eurysaces, the child who has such beautiful curly hair, soft hands and feet, blushes on his cute cheeks, and has such shining eyes, and a cheerful voice. His every expression, his every act, every word are precious. I wasn't his father but I love him, truly. How can a person hate and give no love to children? But sadly, I know and experienced them. My father, and the adults I met... some of them tried to hurt me and my own father just sit his golden throne and watched. He never helped me even when I kneel before him and begged with tears. He won't greet me and won't forgive me when I go back to Salamis. He will blame me and might order exile. No, he will.  Take him to Salamis, to our father Telamon.  Telamon always hated me and will curse me when I return to Salamis. I dare not wish his love for I'm a bastard and also slave-born. I think about Eurysaces. I can't certain but I think he will love Eurysaces. He's different. Eurysaces is his grandson, and he's Ajax's child... He deserves every love from his grandfather. Telamon should be, for the boy isn't a hateful child like me. I draw a picture of Telamon treating him kindly. By imagining this, my heart gets more comfort than before.  Now the child closed his eyes. Tecmessa is sick today, and also she hadn't slept well this week. I should lay him in my bed and sleep tonight. At first, the boy looked awkward when he should left his mother for some time. Sure he is. But after hours later he is now tired from playing and Hypnos slowly invite the young boy to his realm. Soon Eurysaces will sleep in my arms. I hope. For I'm also tired.  I brush his hair softy. Little child, my darling nephew. I never saw a pure creature than him. The day I hold his little body when he was a baby, that memory will never fade away.  ""I promise there will be no harm to you,"" I whispered faintly, try not to bother his sleep.  I swear to gods that I will always protect Eurysaces and Tecmessa, make no one can harm them. Even I, who might lose myself just as Ajax did. I begged to the gods have love and mercy for us.  Gods, let him never experience what I went through. Let him never understand the pain I experienced. Let Tecmessa won't be raped again, let her live in peace until her death. Let Eurysaces protect his mother just like his name when he becomes a grown man, unlike me.";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
39722094;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Leuce runs into the fields and looks around, making sure no one is around. She is holding a basket on one arm and woven fabric in her other hand. She lets her shoulders drop with a sigh. She feels a presence behind her and turns around. She smiles at the tall figure when she sees who it is. ""Oh, I was so worried you would not visit.""  ""My apologies for my tardiness, the storm last night caused an influx of shades, but no matters. I am here now."" He takes her free hand in his own.   Leuce looks down at his feet. He holds her chin to lift her head back up. ""It is I who is not worthy of meeting your gaze, my lady.""  Leuce smiles.  ""What did you want to spend the night doing?"" He takes the fabric from her hands and she sets down her basket.   ""I was hoping you would join me for some sweets."" Hades face twists into a frown he mistakenly lets out. ""... I've displeased you.""  Hades lays out the fabric and gestures for her to sit. ""No, no, I just don't have a need for sweets so much."" He kneels and grabs her hand. ""I will of course partake in whatever you suggest I indulge in.""  She takes out a wrapped treat from the basket as well as some fruit. ""Mother and I made a honey cake today."" She unwraps it and places it on the blanket. She takes a piece of the cake with her hands and offers it to him. He takes it and takes a bite.   ----  Leuce stands alone in her bedroom. She sits on her couch and kicks her feet impatiently. She takes her sandals off and tosses them to the floor. Hades enters her room at the clattering sound.  ""Are you alright?"" Leuce crosses her arms and huffs. ""You are upset with it here.""  ""I am restless. I have nothing to do. I miss up above and the nature."" Hades frowns and crosses to her. He extends his hand to her and she takes it.   ""It is not just cold and dark down here. You have spent all week here. Come."" He stands up and pulls her to the doorway. They weave through the winding halls of Hades. He takes her outside his residence.  ""I shall take you on a full tour another day,"" They enter a bright, yellow field, blooming with life. ""But this is Elysium."" They hear a small group of people laughing over the hills. Leuce lets go of his hand and basks in the warmth of the sun, sitting in the grass.  ""It is like you were to pluck the sun out of the sky and place it here."" She smiles up at him. ""How did I not know there is good down here?""  ""Hm."" Hades sits down next to her. ""Perhaps because you are not dead."" Leuce giggles and shakes her head. ""You mortals have such a dreadful outlook of death. If you are good, you deserve good.""  They peoplewatch,  or perhaps shadewatch , Leuce thinks to herself, stifling a giggle, for a few hours. Leuce can't really tell down here. The sun hasn't moved an inch in the sky.   ----  Hades has lost count of how many games they've played together. He is no longer her tutor in petteia.  She plays white, he plays black.  She has become a worthy competitor, he finds quickly. She has a logical brain, besides her creative homely skills in weaving.  She beats him twice that day. He blames it on a lack of sleep, for the sake of his outer ego, but he doesn't really mind.  ----  Leuce is laying on her couch. She is old. She is tired. She is feeling lonely though for most of her life, she was never alone. ""Aidoneus..."" she calls for him weakly.  Hades enters her room. He stops by the door. He can tell she is not well. The god of the dead knows what death looks like. ""Leuce,"" he kneels by her and takes her hands in his own.      Neither of them say anything.     He slowly moves her top half up on the couch so he can hold her. Thanatos quietly enters the room and quickly exits. He holds her for a long time, quietly sobbing.      He picks her up and carries her out of the room. He takes her out of his residence and to the Elysium Fields. He focuses all his energy into his hands and transforms her into a sapling.      ""A white poplar tree.""     He plants the tree in the center of the fields, and brushes the dirt off his hands onto his chiton. He rests against the tree and cries once again.  ----  ""Husband.""  Hades' thoughts are interrupted by his wife's voice behind him. He's in the Elysium Fields, hands touching the leaves of his beloved tree. He turns to face his wife. ""Yes?""  ""Come. It's time. I must go up with my mother. Be my chaperone."" Persephone reaches out her hand and he takes it. They walk out of their residence, their kingdom and their realm and he delivers her to her mother as he does at the start of every spring. ";;;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;0;0;1;rule
48848398;;;;;Cassandra (dream);;;;;;Ajax;;;;;;implied assault;;;;;When Riliane is young, she learns stories. Myths from worlds long gone past, dug from the ruins of a museum that dug them up from ruins. Stories where the gods can be kind or cruel, stories with dashing heroes and creatures she doesn't dare imagine. Her favorite is that of the Trojan princess Cassandra. A tragedy, and yet she memories it and carves the tale into her heart.     When she is still younger, they call her intuitive. She always seems to know when trouble will happen and avoids it. They call it reflex, hypervigilance caused by near constant assassination attempts. When she tells them she dreams of them, they tell her she is plagued by nightmares, and tell her they will fade as she grows.     When she is older, and still gets visions of things yet to happen, they call her mad behind closed doors, before swearing her to secrecy about such things in public. She is taught to feel ashamed of a talent that has saved her life many a time. She is no witch, and her dreams are not purple, so of what significance are they other than a sign of her sanity escaping. She shares a dream once, of a drought, in the council room, and that is all it takes to be outcast.     The drought happens, of course, but why worry about that when the world could point and laugh at the crazy princess, who sees things in her sleep and is convinced they are real in the daytime. If she was not the heir, they would have locked her up in a tower somewhere or sent her to a convent to be forgotten, because it is much easier to discredit than to listen.    But she is the heir, so they do the next best thing: betroth her as soon as possible and make sure the ministry will always have more power than she does. Any supporter she has after that, the ones that call her a prophetess or a Saint, quickly dissappear. But now she has a word for what she sees: prophecies.     She sees her mother's death long before it happens, yet cannot bring herself to mourn the woman who sealed her fate. So she doesn't cry, not at the funeral or her initial death. And the few tears she sheds are not for the late queen, but for the loss of her future. And the loss of a brother, not allowed to come to the palace to serve the insane princess. Perhaps that is what truly seals her fate.     She sees the future in all its bloody glory, and she knows the ministry will be her end. They are foolish, quick to take insult, and quick to line their pockets. They will spark war, and people will die, and they will come for her head. They could use her foresight, but that would require hoping off their pedestals they made for themselves. And that is unthinkable to them.     So she allows it all, does not even speak if she doesn't have too. But she thinks. Thinks of the tailor's daughter she will be soon, and thinks of that brutal fate. She thinks of the Postman, before realizing it wouldn't change much to live that way now. But most of all, she thinks of Cassandra. And little by little she realizes how very alike they are. She wonders if they are one in the same, and the next night she dreams of Troy burning, and of Ajax. She vomits afterwards, before taking a bath and trying to scrub away the skin he touched as he held her down.      When the revolution happens, she stands on the balcony farthest from them, though they all but surround the castle. Still, there are spots they have not circled around to. And so she looks out. And she wonders if she's willing to live a bit longer only for another Ajax or Agamemmnon to come for her. She is not. And so she jumps off the balcony. And Cassandra dies, not for the first or last time.;;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
30281253;;;;;Araminta Sizemore;;;;;;herself;;;;;;suicide;;;;;"1  The black veil gives a women decent privacy with her thoughts.  Corrie Worth, newly widowed, brushed crimson on her lips with a practiced hand, adjusted her hat over graying curls, and lowered the veil. Black gloves, bought at Woolworth's, weren't of the quality usually demanded by the wife of the third-richest mine owner in Harlan County; but sometimes keeping up appearances meant letting down standards.  She stepped into the waiting black Cadillac with the assurance of a woman who'd been driven all her life.  2  Her very first Cadillac had appeared when she was walking to school, barefoot to save her shoes, on a road more stones than dirt.  Looking back at herself with grown-up eyes, she saw an underfed girl who at sixteen looked no more than a city girl's twelve, still in braids, with her calico dress a little too short but no money to replace it. Her mother did miracles, farming the rocky soil and the steep mountainsides, but weather's a fickle friend.  The back door of the Cadillac opened, and Dixon Worth offered her a bag of peppermint candy to get in. She was too stupid with hunger to say no.  3  For Dixon Worth's funeral, the preacher took as his text 2 Corinthians 4:8-9. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.  The slip of a girl on the other side of the church wept with the concentration of a person who's biting the inside of her cheek and thinking about when her dog died.  Corrie would have lent her a veil if they could have admitted to knowing each other.  4  Sheriff J.H. Blair was one of the first to shake the preacher's hand after the service. Corrie suspected she could have danced naked on Dixon's coffin without shaking Blair from his certainty that he'd caught the right men when he jailed those striking miners as murderers.  What will they stoop to next? had become the center of dinner-party conversation among the mine-owning families. A new widow wasn't invited, of course, but word got back to her. This time, they attacked one of us on in the dark. Next, they'll be murdering us in our beds.  A more horrifying idea followed, one that had to be couched in a whisper. Next, they'll be raping our daughters.  Remembering how she'd wed Dixon--trembling and shamed, fearing that she'd made a baby, fearing that she'd incited him somehow--Corrie could almost laugh at fearing the miners.  A black veil hides a widow's unseemly swings of emotion.  5  The girl waited until Corrie had laid her rose on the coffin before she stepped forward with a straggling handful of daisies.  She had the fine features and sinuous movements of a naiad somehow stranded in these coal-rich hills, forced to guard a stream where the mines spewed waste. She might have meant to marry a coal-miner or go to Lexington for factory work or even chase the Hollywood men from the recording companies to get a contract singing songs older than the hills.  For less than a flicker of rain, Corrie's green eyes met the girl's clear blue gaze. The girl mouthed thank you.  6  Corrie had guessed when she found the pink lipstick on Dixon's silk handkerchief, but she hadn't cared until word got back through the servants that little Araminta Sizemore had tried slicing her wrists.  She'd sent a pair of cream-colored gloves--the good ones, from the shop in Lexington--with a message written small and folded into one finger.  7  Her own nightmares about miners involved hanged men, ropes still around their necks, accusing her. Once Dixon's safely in the ground, she'll turn to Sheriff J.H. Blair for comfort, and he'll mysteriously lose the keys to the jail, just long enough for the miners to escape. Their lives won't be worth much in Harlan County, but that's nothing new.  The thought of Blair sweating and grunting atop her nauseated Corrie, but it wasn't not right that any more people suffer for Dixon's sins.  8  Peppermint tea, so refreshing was the murmur among guests at the house after the funeral. Talking about Dixon's murder wasn't proper, not in front of his widow.  9  Raising the pick over her head had taken all Corrie's strength, but the wet, crushing noise when it entered Dixon's head had made the effort worth it.";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
37903318;;;;;Orpheus;;;;;;Maenads;;;;;;tearing;;;;;"Orpheus is signing.       He sung, his love for me. His all consuming love for Eurydice.  My sisters with shaking hands and trepidation in their eyes wove flowers in my hair. Pretending not to noticing the deadened quake in my thighs. He had saw me dance, heard me sing. And with his lyre decided we would be. He sung his songs, plucked his instrument and all who heard believed that he and me were in love. I did not know this mortal man's name, I did not love him. But the gods loved him, his honeyed voice and strings he plucked.     I could not say no....      Believe me. I tried.     Orpheus is playing      My sisters dressed me in a gown, white like our funerals.  They sang the songs they told Orpheus was love, but were the rights of our dead. Crushed lips on my berries, I can feel his rough hands on my skin. Before our marriage, pinned me down. Shoved himself between me, red is staining the white of the gown.      His white dripping down my brown thighs.      Orpheus is preparing.      My sisters take my hands, the nymph I love brushes her fingers over my lips. Orpheus is ripping up her bushes.  And the last thing I have of her is the scent of her flowers when he presents me a bouquet.      Orpheus is threatening.      My sisters walk me to a river, and we dance. Locked hands and slow for my shaking thighs and bruised insides to keep tempo. One touches my face, her hand is cold as she minds me of her own love. It is said she was turned to stone and her head removed.     Orpheus is waiting.      With closed eyes, I trust their steps and follow suit in mine.      Orpheus is watching.      I felt his eyes on me, tracing my brown skin through the white gown. The curve of my hips, the swell of my breasts, the painting of blood and himself he left in my folds. His gaze is a blight upon me.      She had never forced me into her bed.      My friend, a viper, lies in wait. And when my foot, callused and rough lands near her; she strikes.      Orpheus is wailing.      Hermes takes my hand, apologizes as he takes me from him.  My sisters had hidden coins under my tongue, and quickly before he can stop the god-- I spit my fair into his hand.  The god looks surprised, but with golden sandals and a winged helmet he takes me to the underworld. He believes Orpheus's lies when he said I love him.       He spoke to me about Orpheus, his music is wonders and Apollo himself is jealous of his hands.      I in turn spoke to him about the scent of her bushes, the taste of her berries, the feeling of her laugh pressed into my hair.  The soft swirl of her around me as we danced, how raspy her voice was when we sang.      Her murder by his hands.     Hermes is silent.      Orpheus is singing.      The messenger god is kind when he hands the rower my fair, I am alone when he rows me across the River Styx. I dip my hand into the river, the rower screams at me. But the nymph is one I know, and she will not harm me.  Her face appears in the reflection of mine, we are both red-eyed and swollen.      The three headed dog escorts me to his queen and his king. I kneel before them both, and I ask for my love.      Orpheus is walking.       The Queen of Dead and Flowers knows that a mortal man should have never made his home in my thighs, and she knows the nymph I have loved and followed.       She is there, a flower blossoming in her presence.  She lifts my face, and I am able to taste her berries crushed on my lips.      She loves me.      Pleading, I dance, I sing, here my thighs do not ache. My insides are not bruised.      Before, I was even greater than Orpheus.       The Queen and King cry when I tell them of the paint of blood and white on my flowers folds.  Persephone wails when I sing of the murder of my love, Hades covers his mouth when he learns the viper did what I asked.      Orpheus is arriving.      As I dance, as I sing I beg them not to honor his demands. I sing as if I am sparring. Each verse is a blow to their immortal ears. His rough hands against me, his forcing himself upon me, his threatening to break my fingers and slit my throat if I dared to out play him.  The disgrace of having to be touched by him.      Persephone understands me. And Hades plans for me.        Orpheus is entering.      The Queen and the King listen to his plea, comparing his song to mine. I hold her hand tight.      The Queen and the King have to hold their shoulders back as he spews his lies. How I love him, the treachery of the snake, the flowers, stones and the trees crying for them.      They were not crying for him and me in mourning. They were crying for me and my love. Their tears had no purpose for him.      Orpheus is lying.      Hades says he will allow me to journey with him to the mortal world. Provided he does not look back to me.      Persephone will whisper in his ear, in the darkness doubt, of her husband.      Orpheus is celebrating.      I follow where he leads, his song singing of what he will do to me when we enter the sun. Demanding me to answer when the Queen's voice is too strong.      Persephone, when we are half to the mortal world tells me not to answer. I feel her hands on my waist, the swell of where my womb presses against my skin and the folds of fat on my belly. I feel her love and protection heal the injuries of my half living half shade form.  Restoring me to what I am.  Her acts of rage were ones she learned from me.      We had danced before she became the queen. Now I have the confirmation that she still remembers me.      Orpheus is doubting.     He steps to the sunlight, the Queen trailing behind and whispering one final deceit.  I stay behind, one final step before I would be trapped with him.      Orpheus is turning.      I see my sisters behind him, celebration as our queen gently, puts her hands on me and to her I follow where she leads.      Orpheus has failed.      Her lips I trace with my fingertips, her hands are soft upon me. Kisses where he laid his marks upon me, leaving her sweet flora scent where his male musk was forced upon me.      Our Queen and Our King ask us to sing. And with her raspy and my sweet voice.      Eurydice is singing.   ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
24160720;;;;;unborn child;;;;;;Ajax the Lesser;;;;;;miscarriage;;;;;"When Cassandra is making her decision, she sees all of the possible futures. She hears what people will say about her. Opportunist. Whore who couldn't keep her word. Liar. Wicked. Ambitious. Bitch who doesn't know her place. Cunning. Cold. Proud. Selfish. Witch without a piece of a women in herself with a cursing touch. An amazon who wouldn't be broken under the severe pressure. Cassandra heard all of that when she made her decision.  There is some truth on all of the rumours - it was ambitious and maybe even a little bit selfish to ask for such a gift a man she already desired so much. But is it really so bad to want more from live? To want more than a handsome husband and twenty children? To want to see the world? To experience something? To be unique?  And besides she was convinced that Apollo will leave her someday. Sooner or later she will have to live without the godly tinsel. Was it so bad to want to keep at least a little piece of him? Would someone object if everything turned out differently?  But this was never a possibility in the future, so Cassandra could never be sure.  How a prophetic gift was filling her pieces of future started to fly through her head. Golden in the beginning how everything was illuminated by Apollo and happiness and their shared love. She saw them making love and it was just a glimpse, but she was overwhelmed anyway. And then she saw him, their perfect son, living image of Apollo aside from his dark curls which were all hers. And she loved him, she loved him so much, because to her he was already alive.  And then everything darkened because Paris came to them and her father was resolved that he could fight the destiny. He trusted her and Helenus that Paris means danger, but his heart was too soft, and he couldn't do what needed to be done and accepted him to the family instead. And this Cassandra was a mother and contemplated escaping while it was still possible, but in the end... she couldn't desert her family. Still hoping that something could be done. And the war is coming. And the war is here. And her son is growing so quickly, because these dark times aren't fit for children and heroes are growing up quickly when it is needed.  And he is just five, but he looks like fourteen years old. And she is pregnant again and all she sees is a darkness and death. Her brothers dying like flies and she knows that they don't return when they are marching to their last battles. There is nothing she could do, and she is going insane. And her little girl is born, all Apollo with his glowing golden curls except for nose which is all her own. And she is hardly baby at all, after a week she looks like a one year old, after a month she looks like three-year-old and after a year she is a fourteen years old maiden.  Her son who looks like an adult now is fighting for Troy and she is dying with fear even though she knows he have his father's protection. And her fear was justified because one piece of a future later, she is holding her dead son in her arms. He is just seven years old, even though he is taller than her. And she is blind with a grief and everybody is celebrating ending of a war, but she still knows this isn't it. She is trying to tell them, but they thought her insane with grief and she just don't have a strength to argue with them and she is pregnant again and she knows that her end is near and Apollo is gone, mourning on his own and she needs him so much right now.  And then the city is flooded by them and she knew this will happen and managed to escape to temple of Athena with her daughter. She known they would never desecrate temple of Athena, she was their goddess, their sponsor. She thought they are at least a little safe there, but then the future started shifting and Cassandra was terrified. They were trapped here. They were trapped here, and Achaeans were barbarians. Ajax the Lesser entered the temple and Cassandra tried to shield her daughter with her body. All their fight was for naught. He raped her daughter right there on Athena's altar, made her watch the whole act. And when her turn came, she was so numb with pain and grief she wasn't even fighting. She was looking into Athena's eyes instead asking her to make him pay for it. She lost her unborn child right there on the floor of the temple and the only thing that was holding her alive was her daughter. She lives and Cassandra must take care of her.  In that moment Cassandra was done. All she wanted was to stop these images and feelings which flooded her head and body, but she couldn't stop it. She couldn't stop it and she must see it to the grim end.  They aren't capable to punish Ajax, but Cassandra knows Athena will punish them all for that and it lessens the pain a little. They divide the women among themselves like livestock and she couldn't be even sicker anymore. Diomedes claims her daughter and Cassandra is horrified because she is glad it is him; he could keep her daughter alive; he is sensible, and she sees his safe sale home. She is horrified because she is glad for her daughter's slavery. King Agamemnon claims her, and she sees her own death then and everything skips forward.  She is staying in front of the Mycenae gates, her daughter is dead then, one of the casualties of travelling. And she sees her own death, waiting behind the gate, and all that will follow. And at this point she thought that the fate couldn't surprise her, but then she sees the world burning, the sun crushing to the ground, Apollo raging, monsters plundering and plague spreading. She sees Apollo blaming Zeus for everything but knowing he can't defeat the most powerful god of all. But destroying is so much easier that winning and Apollo doesn't care about anything right now. And she sees it, she sees the end of the world, she sees his death, she sees everybody's death. And that's the end of it.  Cassandra sees all of it when she makes her decision. And she isn't sure if anything can be prevented, but she knows she must change things and it hurts so much, because she knows what she is giving up. She loves him now; she loves their children. Maybe deserting Troy would be enough, but she knows she couldn't risk it and then there is only one option left. She hurts him. She hurts him so badly he would never forgive her. And he curses her in return and there is no turning back now.        Apollo watches her standing in front Mycenae gate. He watches her die. He thought it would be freeing, maybe even satisfactory. Instead he feels sad and hollow. There is still withered flower of his love deep in his heard. His anger cooled down at last and he doesn't understand her any better now. He still can't understand what happened then. The truth died with her and he is prepared to let it go, but before that he'll make sure that she will be avenged.";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

591456;;;;;Sicani people;;;;;;Medusa;;;;;;violence;;;;;Eldest of the sisters, Medusa alone stood the guardian of the Eastern gates of Sicani by the lapping sea. With unblinking gaze, she watched against the rising of the sun and the tides of invaders that sought to take the wide olive groves of Sicani for themselves. Her sister, Euryale, guarded the western gate with brazen hands and fearsome cries. The people of the city stood with her there. They held their shields together as impenetrable scales under her guidance. Stheno, the youngest, the softest of aspect, hers was to face the mountainous north with its crags and eagles' reach. With her yellow wings, she often flew to perch there. The great eagles and the seahawks, they flocked to her and took the flesh of the sea from her brazen hands.  The sea that lapped upon the harbor, they did not guard against. Were they not the daughters of the chthonic sea? They were the daughters of Phycys and Ceto coiled down far into the deep. They were the daughters of wine deep darkness and salt and echoes.  Medusa was in love.   She did not show it easily. That was not her nature. Her nature was unblinking. Her nature was the strong slide of great coils through the rolling hills bestrewn in ancient olive groves.   In the springtime of the year, when the yellow pollen fell from the trees, she first looked out from the Eastern gate and met the gaze of grey-eyed Athena. She, the daughter of a younger god, whose father consumed her mother in a single swallow. His monstrous aspect hidden between red smacking lips and a golden beard.  Medusa, she was unafraid. She strode out from her gate. Her spear in her hand. She pushed back the frozen mask of her helm, the bronze of it an eternal scream of righteous rage. The pollen fell golden upon her face. It trembled upon her lashes. Her bronze hair tumbled free. It alone indicated the tumbled nature of her feelings in that moment. That golden hour when she first met the gaze of grey-eyed Athena, wise as a serpent and contained too in her aspect.  They gazed into each other on that morning.   It would be imprudent to describe then what occurred between them. What happened when the eldest of the Gorgon sisters and Pallas Athena first met. It would be best to then say that Medusa opened her gates to Athena and let her into the city to dwell there.   On the highest hill within the polis, Medusa built for Athena a temple with wide open doors. That all might come in and find wisdom.  In the temple of Athena, they were often together. Athena at her loom, as Medusa watched her clever hands at their weaving. It was their home. They met with Euryale and shared bread drizzled with olive oil. They met with Stheno and played games.   They were in love. They pleated their fingers as one might weave the threads in a loom. They played at games together.   It would be imprudent to say more and yet, who writes with prudence that tells the tales of gods?  The kisses of their lips were as rich and golden as an olive oil of first press. Not virgin sisters kisses these, no. Medusa was a daughter of the chthonic sea. She kissed as fiercely. Athena, whose first words were a battle cry, she gave nothing way, but willing battled for Medusa's regard. Athena was the goddess of craft and arts and skill. Her fingers were clever. She crafted such things as to give her love delight. Athena greatly loved to rest her clever head upon the wild bronze masses of Medusa's hair and speak the names of clouds as they lay upon the flat roof of the temple. Medusa greatly loved to pay tribute to Athena and hold her tightly wrapped in her coils. They delighted in each other.   They were in love.   The lapping sea brushed against the sea steps that led down into the water. It was summer and all was blessed in the world. The olives grew round and ripe in the ancient olive groves that stretched into the rolling hills of the East.  In autumn of the year, the people of Sicani plucked the olives and took in the harvest. They fortified the walls of their homes. They painted the doors blue against the winter winds.  The lapping sea surged in its tides against the port of Sicani. It rose and fell. The boats of the fishermen rose and fell with it.  The wintertime came. With it the storms of grey skies and rain. In sorrowing aspect, Athena left for a journey to spend the shortest days with her father on high Olympus. That there might be some wisdom there.  They parted with sorrowing hearts and hopeful fingers.   Medusa was unafraid. Stheno mourned the loss of long days of flying in blue skies. Euryale used this time in training with the people. But Medusa reveled in the rain. She walked down the sea steps and she swam in the sea. Was it not her mother? Was it not her father?  Alas, Medusa had forgotten it was no longer chthonic days. There then her crime. To forget and for an instant close her eyes against the salt of the sea.  For in that winter storm, Poseidon looked upon her with her clouds of bronze hair floating in the fierce waves and found her beautiful. As she slithered back up onto the sea steps, he called to her and offered all the bounty of the sea if she would lie with him, but once. Her aspect was unchanged. She looked at him with unblinking blue-green eyes and picked up her spear in answer.  She forgot. What is a spear against the sea?  The waves roared. They crashed upon the harbor. There was no sea wall. The waves rushed past. They flooded the streets. Salt water poured past the doors painted blue. Whole families drowned. Grandmothers clutching at the plump legs of the babe just born. Euryale did what she could. She gathered her soldiers and led the people to the higher ground. Stheno battered as well she could against the wind and led them to the high passes in the mountains.  Medusa, she remained. She alone was the guardian of the Eastern gates.  But this was the sea. She fell back higher and higher within the emptied city. Poseidon pursued her. She cast her spear and the waves parted before it. She climbed the steps to the temple of Athena. She went into the temple with wide open doors that all might come in and find wisdom there.  It would be cruel to speak of what occurred there on the floor of the temple of Athena. What occurred on the marble that Medusa herself had carved for her love. The sea desired. The sea took. When the waters finally receded, buildings had been thrown from their moorings. Ships lay tilted upon the flat roofs where the people had gathered in halcyon days.  And the dead. There were so many dead.   Medusa screamed. She was rage personified.   She thrashed with her coils. She did as much damage then as the sea had done. Her screams were unending. She wrent the sky with them.  In the mountains above, Euryale wept. Stheno hid her face behind her wings. The Sicani cried out in fear.   The sisters parted from them then. They went to their sister, but Medusa could not be comforted.   Athena returned.   Tears poured down her stalwart cheeks. But Athena could only be the goddess that she was. She spoke of temperance and strategy and appeals to the law of Olympus. The blue-green gaze of Medusa met grey-eyed Athena then. She asked then what of the law for Metis? What of Athena's mother, consumed by her father, the young king of the gods. This was the rule of law. She did not say these words. She shouted them as she crashed her mighty coils. Athena gave her then the only comfort that she could.  Medusa's aspect, she changed to the face of her bronze helm. An eternal scream that her voice might rest. Her bronze curls that she had so loved, that had so drawn the sea lapping softly at the sea steps, she transformed into venomous serpents that none might trifle with her again. Her eyes, the eyes of the daughter of a chthonic sea, she made as stone and to look them was to become stone. Even the sea. Even the ever changing sea would be stone were it to look therein.  She might have then have waited. But for all her wisdom, Athena was a child of a younger god. Medusa bid her leave and Athena left. Her love grew gravid with the children the sea had forced upon her that day. She would not let fall from her body. She kept them inside herself. She ripped up the ancient olive groves. She destroyed the temple. She destroyed the city. Until even Euryale and Stheno were forced to make way from the city that was polis no more. Only the dead lived there.   Only statues of heroes that sought to slay the monster that dwelt there. They wanted the treasure of Siciani. The golden casks of olive oil transmuted by time and legend into boxes of gold.   There was no treasure. The olive oil had long since gone rancid on the touch of the sea.  Athena in time grew wiser then. It is not prudent to speak of the gods being unwise. But even the most clever can grow in wisdom. What were the thoughts of the goddess of craft and skill and defense when she sent Perseus with a shield as bright as a mirror to her love? It cannot be known.  But thereafter upon the shield of grey-eyed Athena, wise as a serpent, she bore the face of Medusa in her eternal rage. A goddess of wisdom may not be inclined to forgetfulness. She may also consider that in the end, even gods may die and the sea may turn to stone.;;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

She shouted them as she crashed her mighty coils. Athena gave her then the only comfort that she could.  Medusa's aspect, she changed to the face of her bronze helm. An eternal scream that her voice might rest. Her bronze curls that she had so loved, that had so drawn the sea lapping softly at the sea steps, she transformed into venomous serpents that none might trifle with her again. Her eyes, the eyes of the daughter of a chthonic sea, she made as stone and to look them was to become stone. Even the sea. Even the ever changing sea would be stone were it to look therein.  She might have then have waited. But for all her wisdom, Athena was a child of a younger god. Medusa bid her leave and Athena left. Her love grew gravid with the children the sea had forced upon her that day. She would not let fall from her body. She kept them inside herself. She ripped up the ancient olive groves. She destroyed the temple. She destroyed the city. Until even Euryale and Stheno were forced to make way from the city that was polis no more. Only the dead lived there.   Only statues of heroes that sought to slay the monster that dwelt there. They wanted the treasure of Siciani. The golden casks of olive oil transmuted by time and legend into boxes of gold.   There was no treasure. The olive oil had long since gone rancid on the touch of the sea.  Athena in time grew wiser then. It is not prudent to speak of the gods being unwise. But even the most clever can grow in wisdom. What were the thoughts of the goddess of craft and skill and defense when she sent Perseus with a shield as bright as a mirror to her love? It cannot be known.  But thereafter upon the shield of grey-eyed Athena, wise as a serpent, she bore the face of Medusa in her eternal rage. A goddess of wisdom may not be inclined to forgetfulness. She may also consider that in the end, even gods may die and the sea may turn to stone.;;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
591456;;;;;Metis;;;;;;Cronus;;;;;;consumption;;;;;Eldest of the sisters, Medusa alone stood the guardian of the Eastern gates of Sicani by the lapping sea. With unblinking gaze, she watched against the rising of the sun and the tides of invaders that sought to take the wide olive groves of Sicani for themselves. Her sister, Euryale, guarded the western gate with brazen hands and fearsome cries. The people of the city stood with her there. They held their shields together as impenetrable scales under her guidance. Stheno, the youngest, the softest of aspect, hers was to face the mountainous north with its crags and eagles' reach. With her yellow wings, she often flew to perch there. The great eagles and the seahawks, they flocked to her and took the flesh of the sea from her brazen hands.  The sea that lapped upon the harbor, they did not guard against. Were they not the daughters of the chthonic sea? They were the daughters of Phycys and Ceto coiled down far into the deep. They were the daughters of wine deep darkness and salt and echoes.  Medusa was in love.   She did not show it easily. That was not her nature. Her nature was unblinking. Her nature was the strong slide of great coils through the rolling hills bestrewn in ancient olive groves.   In the springtime of the year, when the yellow pollen fell from the trees, she first looked out from the Eastern gate and met the gaze of grey-eyed Athena. She, the daughter of a younger god, whose father consumed her mother in a single swallow. His monstrous aspect hidden between red smacking lips and a golden beard.  Medusa, she was unafraid. She strode out from her gate. Her spear in her hand. She pushed back the frozen mask of her helm, the bronze of it an eternal scream of righteous rage. The pollen fell golden upon her face. It trembled upon her lashes. Her bronze hair tumbled free. It alone indicated the tumbled nature of her feelings in that moment. That golden hour when she first met the gaze of grey-eyed Athena, wise as a serpent and contained too in her aspect.  They gazed into each other on that morning.   It would be imprudent to describe then what occurred between them. What happened when the eldest of the Gorgon sisters and Pallas Athena first met. It would be best to then say that Medusa opened her gates to Athena and let her into the city to dwell there.   On the highest hill within the polis, Medusa built for Athena a temple with wide open doors. That all might come in and find wisdom.  In the temple of Athena, they were often together. Athena at her loom, as Medusa watched her clever hands at their weaving. It was their home. They met with Euryale and shared bread drizzled with olive oil. They met with Stheno and played games.   They were in love. They pleated their fingers as one might weave the threads in a loom. They played at games together.   It would be imprudent to say more and yet, who writes with prudence that tells the tales of gods?  The kisses of their lips were as rich and golden as an olive oil of first press. Not virgin sisters kisses these, no. Medusa was a daughter of the chthonic sea. She kissed as fiercely. Athena, whose first words were a battle cry, she gave nothing way, but willing battled for Medusa's regard. Athena was the goddess of craft and arts and skill. Her fingers were clever. She crafted such things as to give her love delight. Athena greatly loved to rest her clever head upon the wild bronze masses of Medusa's hair and speak the names of clouds as they lay upon the flat roof of the temple. Medusa greatly loved to pay tribute to Athena and hold her tightly wrapped in her coils. They delighted in each other.   They were in love.   The lapping sea brushed against the sea steps that led down into the water. It was summer and all was blessed in the world. The olives grew round and ripe in the ancient olive groves that stretched into the rolling hills of the East.  In autumn of the year, the people of Sicani plucked the olives and took in the harvest. They fortified the walls of their homes. They painted the doors blue against the winter winds.  The lapping sea surged in its tides against the port of Sicani. It rose and fell. The boats of the fishermen rose and fell with it.  The wintertime came. With it the storms of grey skies and rain. In sorrowing aspect, Athena left for a journey to spend the shortest days with her father on high Olympus. That there might be some wisdom there.  They parted with sorrowing hearts and hopeful fingers.   Medusa was unafraid. Stheno mourned the loss of long days of flying in blue skies. Euryale used this time in training with the people. But Medusa reveled in the rain. She walked down the sea steps and she swam in the sea. Was it not her mother? Was it not her father?  Alas, Medusa had forgotten it was no longer chthonic days. There then her crime. To forget and for an instant close her eyes against the salt of the sea.  For in that winter storm, Poseidon looked upon her with her clouds of bronze hair floating in the fierce waves and found her beautiful. As she slithered back up onto the sea steps, he called to her and offered all the bounty of the sea if she would lie with him, but once. Her aspect was unchanged. She looked at him with unblinking blue-green eyes and picked up her spear in answer.  She forgot. What is a spear against the sea?  The waves roared. They crashed upon the harbor. There was no sea wall. The waves rushed past. They flooded the streets. Salt water poured past the doors painted blue. Whole families drowned. Grandmothers clutching at the plump legs of the babe just born. Euryale did what she could. She gathered her soldiers and led the people to the higher ground. Stheno battered as well she could against the wind and led them to the high passes in the mountains.  Medusa, she remained. She alone was the guardian of the Eastern gates.  But this was the sea. She fell back higher and higher within the emptied city. Poseidon pursued her. She cast her spear and the waves parted before it. She climbed the steps to the temple of Athena. She went into the temple with wide open doors that all might come in and find wisdom there.  It would be cruel to speak of what occurred there on the floor of the temple of Athena. What occurred on the marble that Medusa herself had carved for her love. The sea desired. The sea took. When the waters finally receded, buildings had been thrown from their moorings. Ships lay tilted upon the flat roofs where the people had gathered in halcyon days.  And the dead. There were so many dead.   Medusa screamed. She was rage personified.   She thrashed with her coils. She did as much damage then as the sea had done. Her screams were unending. She wrent the sky with them.  In the mountains above, Euryale wept. Stheno hid her face behind her wings. The Sicani cried out in fear.   The sisters parted from them then. They went to their sister, but Medusa could not be comforted.   Athena returned.   Tears poured down her stalwart cheeks. But Athena could only be the goddess that she was. She spoke of temperance and strategy and appeals to the law of Olympus. The blue-green gaze of Medusa met grey-eyed Athena then. She asked then what of the law for Metis? What of Athena's mother, consumed by her father, the young king of the gods. This was the rule of law. She did not say these words.

A broken and twisted face of horror that walked among the people and gods plucking life from those who stood too close.

Three kings, the youngest and ruler of the sea, frozen in his seat pondering if he should agree with his brother, the middle, king of all and destined to punish me to my death, the eldest yet forgotten, eyeing me with indifference that shielded a pestering love. I was to be judged for the crimes I've committed among the mortals in the yesteryears of my immortal youth.     ""Kore,"" Zeus's voice boomed through the grand temple. He always had to be so loud, demanding attention from budding insecurities that lay in the pits of his mind.  I shifted my eyes towards him and peeked through the wet and tangled kinks of my hair. I could sense how uneasy he was with the heaviness of my eyes boring holes into his. I said nothing, keeping myself as eerie and untamed as he knew me best.     He began to talk. Saying something of the other and gesturing to the room around us. I didn't care, I couldn't, these insufferable gods and goddesses knew nothing of compassion and emptiness as I did. They knew nothing of what it meant to be born with the heart of a mortal that was decomposing from within. I felt an ache ripple through my chest and I moved a hand up to grip my dress.

54516907;;;;;soldiers;;;;;;Clardusa;;;;;;slashing;;;;;"         Prologue    Long ago in Greece, in the temple of the goddess Anithea, there lived a priestess who worshipped said goddess daily. The villagers went to the temple only to admire the beautiful Priestess over the goddess, which started to frustrate her. Although the Priestess was beautiful and loyal to the goddess, she was vain, selfish, and unkind. She took advantage of their generosity, thinking she could get away with anything due to her beauty and that she had her purity due to being Anithea's Priestess.  One day, the sea god Posiwin arrived at the temple, and when his eyes first saw the woman, he fell in love with the vain Priestess. He tried wooing her with gifts and charms, but she rejected him, calling his trinkets trash. When he tried again, it seemed to work, but the vain woman called him a repulsive fish and rejected his offerings. Enraged by her rejection, he chased her through the temple and mated with her while she was praying to her goddess for help.  The fish then did her in front of the goddess statue, looking down on them. After being satisfied with what he'd done, the sea god fled the temple just as Anithea arrived at her domain to see her Priestess, worn and panicking, with her clothes torn and hair a mess. The Priestess begged the goddess to punish the sea god for defiling the temple. Anithea was enraged that the girl had allowed herself to be taken advantage of in her temple.  The Priestess, blazing with fury, unleashed a torrent of shouts at the goddess for failing to pursue the sea god for his transgressions. Growing even more incensed by the audacity of the Priestess trying to dictate her actions, the goddess realized that the Priestess showed no remorse for her behavior. In response, the goddess decreed a punishment befitting the Priestess's callousness and transformed her from a once radiant beauty into a monstrous Gorgon, the embodiment of her inner ugliness.  The metamorphosis was a terrifying sight to behold. It happened so quickly that the Priestess attempted to apologize, but it was too late. Shimmering wings of gold burst forth from her back, her once smooth skin transformed into glistening scales, her flowing locks morphed into a writhing mass of venomous serpents, her delicate hands turned into razor-sharp claws with a metallic sheen, her feet evolved into powerful talons, tusks erupted from her mouth while her teeth elongated into menacing fangs. Her visage twisted into a grotesque, snake-like appearance.  The Priestess, now transformed into a Gorgon, fled in terror from the temple and sought the help of the nearby villagers. However, when they saw her, they were instantly turned to stone. Misunderstood and feared, the Gorgon was mistaken for an aggressor and was relentlessly pursued by the villagers. As she fled, she delved deeper into the dense woods, where she caught a glimpse of her reflection in a clear pond and recoiled in horror. Confronted by her monstrous form, the Gorgon sought refuge in the desolate remains of a temple dedicated to the very goddess she once revered but now rejected.  As her sanity slowly deteriorated day by day and night by night, she found herself descending further into the abyss of the monstrous nature that the world and the gods had branded her with. Despite numerous valiant attempts by brave warriors to defeat the beast on behalf of the goddess, just like her own heart, they all met the same fate, turning into statues that adorned the ruins surrounding the temple she called home.          The eerie and petrifying visages of terrified individuals stood frozen in time, encircling the ancient temple. Emerging from the temple's depths, the gorgon Clardusa, cloaked in a veil of shadow, ventured to survey the faces of the unwelcome intruders. Countless had sought to end her life, only to meet the same stony fate as those who preceded them. Upon reaching out to touch one of the statues, she recognized the likeness of a woman from the nearby village. This villager had arrived with a blade, seeking vengeance for her husband's transformation into stone. The frozen countenance of the statue conveyed the unyielding fury of its former living form.  She hears a noise in the distance of the wind and quickly hides behind one of the pillars. After hearing someone land, the sound of footsteps walking toward the noise stops as the invisible person becomes visible. He hears faint breathing coming from the pillar where Clardusa is hiding. He holds his blade behind the pillar around her neck with the pointy part on her cheek, causing small blood to come out from her cheek. As the blood falls into a puddle with a drop, her eye sees his reflection in the water below her, but it is small enough so he can't see her, but she gets a good look at him.  The individual was wearing a distinctive ensemble of mythical items. They donned the helm of darkness, a gift from Gaydes, and the harpe sword made of Adamantine, bestowed by Reus. Their winged sandals were a treasure from Julimes, while the mirror shield was a divine offering from the goddess Anithea. Lastly, the Hesperides gave them the kibisis, a special sack for carrying objects. Considering their possession of these extraordinary items, one might surmise that this person is a demigod. Furthermore, it seems likely that they had located Anithea's residence and may have been sent by her to carry out a sinister task, possibly involving the gruesome act of decapitation.  She needs to think fast. Trying to attack him head-on would most likely result in her death. He asked who she was, not knowing she was the Gorgon he sought. The Gorgon calls herself Minerva and asks for his name, to which he replies, ""Perball."" He tells her he's looking for Gorgon Clardusa, who is in this domain, and then asks why she is not turned to stone like the others. Minerva tells him that she recently arrived at the forest before him, and the Gorgon usually naps inside the temple at this hour.  After a brief pause, he expresses his gratitude for the information and instructs her to depart the woods, which she readily acquiesces. Perball then stealthily makes his way to the temple, utilizing his winged shoes to move silently and turning himself invisible as he enters. Taking advantage of his absence, Clardusa ascends to her temple by taking flight.  As she gently rests her head on the excellent, ancient stone, she strains to hear the faint echoes reverberating from the temple's depths. To conceal her presence, she artfully positions a decoy version of herself in the dimly lit interior, expertly crafted to mimic her form. Through this clever subterfuge, Perball would be convinced that he has stumbled upon the slumbering Gorgon, complete with convincing, pig-like snoring sounds.  Using the mirror to guide him, Perball got close to Clardusa's body, and then, with one fell swoop, he beheaded the ""gorgon"" with his blade. Perball put the head in the sack as he left the temple. After hearing the noise, Clardusa let out a sigh of relief. She could hear the rhythmic flapping of wings as Perball, the troublemaking pixie, flew away from her home. When she was finally confident that the coast was clear, Clardusa called out to the two hidden creatures. Emerging from their hiding spots were two remarkable creatures.  The first was a magnificent winged horse named Pegasus, its presence exuding grace and majesty. The second was a tiny, peculiar winged piglet named Chrysaor, its appearance contrasting sharply with that of Pegasus. Notably, Chrysaor carried a gleaming golden sword strapped to its back, an unexpected sight given its diminutive size. The two are Posiwin's twin sons. Clardusa gave birth to them a few years ago from her mouth. At first, they repulsed her because she was the sea god's kin. They were immune to being turned to stone. Eventually, she got used to them as they kept her company and prevented her from going insane.  Chrysaor approached his mother with concern as he noticed a small amount of blood on her face. He gently hugged her and licked the blood, worried about her well-being. Clardusa reassured him, and even Pegasus, the gentle creature, nuzzled the Gorgon, also showing his concern. With a smile, she comforted them, letting them know that everything was alright and no harm would come to her. In return, she embraced her sons, expressing gratitude for their care.  Perball, still in the forest, was alerted by Anithena, who appeared before him. She told him that he had failed to kill the Gorgon. Perball denied this and then pulled out the head as proof to her, only for her to point out that the head was a fake. He quickly turned his head to discover that it was nothing but a clever trick. The false head was a stuffed imitation, filled with fur and slithering snakes that viciously bit his hand, forcing him to release it. Filled with fury, he plotted his next move to confront the Gorgon again, realizing that this formidable creature was not as easily defeated as he had initially presumed.     Upon their return to the temple, Perball and the soldiers dispatched by Anithea were met with a relentless downpour. Suddenly, a blinding light cut through the rain, illuminating a previously unnoticed statue with its imposing wings outstretched, seeming to protect the ancient temple. Undeterred, they pressed forward, entering the dimly lit temple and seeing torches flickering on the walls. A sudden, chilling sound shattered the stillness, and before they could react, one of the soldiers was struck from behind, falling lifeless into the water. The gorgon emerged stealthily, her lethal arsenal at the ready - a bow, arrows, and a menacing sword. The soldiers lunged forward to confront the gorgon. Yet, their valiant efforts were swiftly met with a swift and deadly counterattack as the gorgon wielded a razor-sharp blade concealed on her back, mowing them down with terrifying precision.  Perball hides in the temple walls, using the mirror shield to make the gorgon think he is there as it hits its arrows at the shield. Perball, using a different shield, waits for the monster to come to him. The monster slithers more and more to where he is, and just as the gorgon is next to him, a quick swing from the sword beheads the beast. He hears a squeal like a pig as the decapitated head starts running around. When looked at in the shield's reflection, the head was a tiny piglet with fake snakes on the head. He tries to run but trips due to his legs, which are bleeding from the wound. The decapitated body removes its disguise as a winged horse grabs the Pig and throws him to its back. Said Pig, holding him tight and not letting go. They run outside the temple, with the piglet squealing for his mom's help.  Clardusa, startled by the commotion, elegantly descended from the sky and discovered Chyroar in distress. As she drew near, she noticed the crimson trail of blood seeping from his wounded legs, inflicted by the treacherous Perball. Without hesitation, Clardusa plunged her brass fingers into her flesh, unleashing a radiant healing energy to mend her son's grievous injury. Unbeknownst to her, Perball, shrouded in invisibility, stealthily advanced toward them, closing in from behind. With malicious intent, he gripped the nape of Clardusa's neck, preparing to deliver a fatal blow with his menacing blade. Suddenly, with a thunderous impact, Pegasus intervened, lashing out with a powerful kick that forced Perball to release his grip. Consequently, Perball's helmet tumbled from his head, exposing his visage and dispelling his invisibility.  Clardusa, with her heart pounding in her chest, seizes the fleeting opportunity and takes flight with Chyroar tightly clutched in her arms. Perball, his mind a whirlwind of emotions, watches with rage and helplessness as the gorgon escapes his grasp. As Pegasus swoops down in a valiant attempt to intercept Clardusa, Perball, fueled by fury and determination, regains his senses just in time to fend off the majestic horse's attack. With a calculated and powerful blow from his shield, he incapacitates Pegasus, sending the noble creature crashing down in a cloud of dust.  His gaze locked onto Clardusa, a smoldering ember of vengeance raging inside him. Perball grasps his sword with steely resolve and flings it at the fleeing gorgon. The blade strikes true, piercing Clardusa's left wing, eliciting a painful and eerie shriek from her. Despite the unbearable torment, she clings to Chyroar with unyielding determination as they plunge further into the depths of the ancient forest. Determined to finish the beast, Perball dashes into the woods to claim her head and present it to the king.";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
54516907;;;;;piglet;;;;;;Clardusa;;;;;;beheading;;;;;"         Prologue    Long ago in Greece, in the temple of the goddess Anithea, there lived a priestess who worshipped said goddess daily. The villagers went to the temple only to admire the beautiful Priestess over the goddess, which started to frustrate her. Although the Priestess was beautiful and loyal to the goddess, she was vain, selfish, and unkind. She took advantage of their generosity, thinking she could get away with anything due to her beauty and that she had her purity due to being Anithea's Priestess.  One day, the sea god Posiwin arrived at the temple, and when his eyes first saw the woman, he fell in love with the vain Priestess. He tried wooing her with gifts and charms, but she rejected him, calling his trinkets trash. When he tried again, it seemed to work, but the vain woman called him a repulsive fish and rejected his offerings. Enraged by her rejection, he chased her through the temple and mated with her while she was praying to her goddess for help.  The fish then did her in front of the goddess statue, looking down on them. After being satisfied with what he'd done, the sea god fled the temple just as Anithea arrived at her domain to see her Priestess, worn and panicking, with her clothes torn and hair a mess. The Priestess begged the goddess to punish the sea god for defiling the temple. Anithea was enraged that the girl had allowed herself to be taken advantage of in her temple.  The Priestess, blazing with fury, unleashed a torrent of shouts at the goddess for failing to pursue the sea god for his transgressions. Growing even more incensed by the audacity of the Priestess trying to dictate her actions, the goddess realized that the Priestess showed no remorse for her behavior. In response, the goddess decreed a punishment befitting the Priestess's callousness and transformed her from a once radiant beauty into a monstrous Gorgon, the embodiment of her inner ugliness.  The metamorphosis was a terrifying sight to behold. It happened so quickly that the Priestess attempted to apologize, but it was too late. Shimmering wings of gold burst forth from her back, her once smooth skin transformed into glistening scales, her flowing locks morphed into a writhing mass of venomous serpents, her delicate hands turned into razor-sharp claws with a metallic sheen, her feet evolved into powerful talons, tusks erupted from her mouth while her teeth elongated into menacing fangs. Her visage twisted into a grotesque, snake-like appearance.  The Priestess, now transformed into a Gorgon, fled in terror from the temple and sought the help of the nearby villagers. However, when they saw her, they were instantly turned to stone. Misunderstood and feared, the Gorgon was mistaken for an aggressor and was relentlessly pursued by the villagers. As she fled, she delved deeper into the dense woods, where she caught a glimpse of her reflection in a clear pond and recoiled in horror. Confronted by her monstrous form, the Gorgon sought refuge in the desolate remains of a temple dedicated to the very goddess she once revered but now rejected.  As her sanity slowly deteriorated day by day and night by night, she found herself descending further into the abyss of the monstrous nature that the world and the gods had branded her with. Despite numerous valiant attempts by brave warriors to defeat the beast on behalf of the goddess, just like her own heart, they all met the same fate, turning into statues that adorned the ruins surrounding the temple she called home.          The eerie and petrifying visages of terrified individuals stood frozen in time, encircling the ancient temple. Emerging from the temple's depths, the gorgon Clardusa, cloaked in a veil of shadow, ventured to survey the faces of the unwelcome intruders. Countless had sought to end her life, only to meet the same stony fate as those who preceded them. Upon reaching out to touch one of the statues, she recognized the likeness of a woman from the nearby village. This villager had arrived with a blade, seeking vengeance for her husband's transformation into stone. The frozen countenance of the statue conveyed the unyielding fury of its former living form.  She hears a noise in the distance of the wind and quickly hides behind one of the pillars. After hearing someone land, the sound of footsteps walking toward the noise stops as the invisible person becomes visible. He hears faint breathing coming from the pillar where Clardusa is hiding. He holds his blade behind the pillar around her neck with the pointy part on her cheek, causing small blood to come out from her cheek. As the blood falls into a puddle with a drop, her eye sees his reflection in the water below her, but it is small enough so he can't see her, but she gets a good look at him.  The individual was wearing a distinctive ensemble of mythical items. They donned the helm of darkness, a gift from Gaydes, and the harpe sword made of Adamantine, bestowed by Reus. Their winged sandals were a treasure from Julimes, while the mirror shield was a divine offering from the goddess Anithea. Lastly, the Hesperides gave them the kibisis, a special sack for carrying objects. Considering their possession of these extraordinary items, one might surmise that this person is a demigod. Furthermore, it seems likely that they had located Anithea's residence and may have been sent by her to carry out a sinister task, possibly involving the gruesome act of decapitation.  She needs to think fast. Trying to attack him head-on would most likely result in her death. He asked who she was, not knowing she was the Gorgon he sought. The Gorgon calls herself Minerva and asks for his name, to which he replies, ""Perball."" He tells her he's looking for Gorgon Clardusa, who is in this domain, and then asks why she is not turned to stone like the others. Minerva tells him that she recently arrived at the forest before him, and the Gorgon usually naps inside the temple at this hour.  After a brief pause, he expresses his gratitude for the information and instructs her to depart the woods, which she readily acquiesces. Perball then stealthily makes his way to the temple, utilizing his winged shoes to move silently and turning himself invisible as he enters. Taking advantage of his absence, Clardusa ascends to her temple by taking flight.  As she gently rests her head on the excellent, ancient stone, she strains to hear the faint echoes reverberating from the temple's depths. To conceal her presence, she artfully positions a decoy version of herself in the dimly lit interior, expertly crafted to mimic her form. Through this clever subterfuge, Perball would be convinced that he has stumbled upon the slumbering Gorgon, complete with convincing, pig-like snoring sounds.  Using the mirror to guide him, Perball got close to Clardusa's body, and then, with one fell swoop, he beheaded the ""gorgon"" with his blade. Perball put the head in the sack as he left the temple. After hearing the noise, Clardusa let out a sigh of relief. She could hear the rhythmic flapping of wings as Perball, the troublemaking pixie, flew away from her home. When she was finally confident that the coast was clear, Clardusa called out to the two hidden creatures. Emerging from their hiding spots were two remarkable creatures.  The first was a magnificent winged horse named Pegasus, its presence exuding grace and majesty. The second was a tiny, peculiar winged piglet named Chrysaor, its appearance contrasting sharply with that of Pegasus. Notably, Chrysaor carried a gleaming golden sword strapped to its back, an unexpected sight given its diminutive size. The two are Posiwin's twin sons. Clardusa gave birth to them a few years ago from her mouth. At first, they repulsed her because she was the sea god's kin. They were immune to being turned to stone. Eventually, she got used to them as they kept her company and prevented her from going insane.  Chrysaor approached his mother with concern as he noticed a small amount of blood on her face. He gently hugged her and licked the blood, worried about her well-being. Clardusa reassured him, and even Pegasus, the gentle creature, nuzzled the Gorgon, also showing his concern. With a smile, she comforted them, letting them know that everything was alright and no harm would come to her. In return, she embraced her sons, expressing gratitude for their care.  Perball, still in the forest, was alerted by Anithena, who appeared before him. She told him that he had failed to kill the Gorgon. Perball denied this and then pulled out the head as proof to her, only for her to point out that the head was a fake. He quickly turned his head to discover that it was nothing but a clever trick. The false head was a stuffed imitation, filled with fur and slithering snakes that viciously bit his hand, forcing him to release it. Filled with fury, he plotted his next move to confront the Gorgon again, realizing that this formidable creature was not as easily defeated as he had initially presumed.     Upon their return to the temple, Perball and the soldiers dispatched by Anithea were met with a relentless downpour. Suddenly, a blinding light cut through the rain, illuminating a previously unnoticed statue with its imposing wings outstretched, seeming to protect the ancient temple. Undeterred, they pressed forward, entering the dimly lit temple and seeing torches flickering on the walls. A sudden, chilling sound shattered the stillness, and before they could react, one of the soldiers was struck from behind, falling lifeless into the water. The gorgon emerged stealthily, her lethal arsenal at the ready - a bow, arrows, and a menacing sword. The soldiers lunged forward to confront the gorgon. Yet, their valiant efforts were swiftly met with a swift and deadly counterattack as the gorgon wielded a razor-sharp blade concealed on her back, mowing them down with terrifying precision.  Perball hides in the temple walls, using the mirror shield to make the gorgon think he is there as it hits its arrows at the shield.

39728892;;;;;narrator;;;;;;unknown;;;;;;sword;;;;;"     Before the Trojan war, but after Aphrodite and her lost love, Adonis, there was me. Luctus Sine Lumen. I have never found a place to belong with people, I reside far outside of Athens, along the edge of the woods near an eerie lake and a field of flowers. At this time I am about 22, My parents had never really been around. My mother left when I was young, and my father drank all the time so, I found my interest in painting and sculpting by the age of six.         No one ever seemed to really want to see my paintings, but I think they're pretty good. I never had any friends- ok well I had one. Adrina, but she was busy taking care of her new family- so I usually just talk to the gods. When my father was around, he told me to never depend on Aphrodite. He told me over and over again that she was good-for-nothing and claimed that love was a facade for fools that are enamored by others. My entire life, my father had belittled the goddess of love, and the idea of it in overall- since, of course, he had been left by his own love. Not that I care of course, I never really paid him any attention, but even then, i still don't really trust the idea of love. I've had crushes of course, but I've never confessed, or dated anyone, or gotten married. I've just been by myself.            My heart has always been in my sculptures and paintings. Never on people. When I was painting, my brush ran over my canvas several times again and again, until it was obvious that I was painting a woman. It was Aphrodite. I had no idea why I suddenly wanted to pay tribute to the goddess in such a manner, but I did so anyway. I suppose I had a childish idea of hope for true love. I spent days painting this woman. Her beauty in the painting was of course- unmatched, and she was watching. The gods could hear someone's prayers to them, their deepest desires, and even if i wasn't aware in the moment, there was the wish in the back of my mind that I would fall in love- maybe to someone as beautiful as the people in my portraits.                Aphrodite took great pleasure and pride in seeing such an act of devotion to her- even if I've never had the opportunity to go and rightfully pray in any of her temples, I still spent a very long time depicting someone of enormous perfection that looked similarly to the goddess. Because of this action, Aphrodite, who was of a great ego, felt the need to grant a wish of mine, and since I had longed deep down to feel what it is to be truly loved, she was going to prove she capable of granting such a desire.               Aphrodite had decided what she was going   to do for me so, she waited, and watched me for a while, catching all of my small comments about how i liked the different outcomes of different pieces. At one point, I had been sculpting the figure of a man, out of clay and rock. The goddess could hear all of my comments-- much to my dismay. Ones about how gorgeous this man was compared to all of the rest of humanity. It was then that she planned it out. On the first day of detailing this man, she would give the sculpture personality, on the second, compassion, the third, a brain, on the fourth, she gave him desire and love for his sculptor, on the very last day that I had worked on the sculpture, when I completed it, the goddess would give the statue life.             I threw myself forward slightly, just enough to wrap my arms around the sculpture. I had sat there for a while, until I felt the warmth of another's skin against my own, and until I felt the pressure of someone else's arms snaking around me. It's as if you can feel how genuine someone is by how they hug- how tightly, how long, and by what they say to you in such a situation. In this instance, what was said by him would stay with me for an eternity, long after I pass on.          ""I can see you...""               I took a minute, but when I finally let my eyes drift upwards, to see who was hugging me, my breath staggered a little and the corners my lips tugged hesitantly into a smile as my glossy, teary eyes swiftly cleared up. There I saw eyes of a deep green color- like jade stones. My eyes scanned around. I cant believe I didn't recognize him immediately. I designed him. The sharp jawline and the shape of this perfect nose belonged to my statue. I gasped and reached my hands up to touch the man's face. He was given life from Aphrodite,and he would from now on, only live for his sculptor. Always. Forever. I was speechless, but I could see the man's eyes looking at me, and then the creation spoke again,          ""You're...gorgeous""             I've never heard such a thing said to me before- under any circumstances at all ever- especially not by a man I sculpted and spent over a week to perfect....or by a man at all. My mouth opened slightly and I tried to stand myself up, earning the assistance of the other man. Once we were both stood up, I sort of regretted making him so muscular and tall. Outside the window were two crows. To avoid awkward eye contact, for a moment, I just stared out at the birds- watching as another bird joined, the three birds stood in the grass for quite a bit before two of them left, leaving one by itself in the field. After a few seconds of that, I turned back to the stranger, having worked up the courage to speak.         ""Do you have a name?"" I spoke in a little bit more of a hushed voice than the other man did-but even so, it was loud enough to hear         ""Aphrodite called me 'Novellus"""" the other responded. Novellus was a name that suited this man quite well- In my opinion at least.         ""Novellus. It is perfect. My name is Luctus. Luctus Sine Lumen"" I answered the taller man immediately.              After we introduced ourselves, I allowed Novellus to stay in my house with me. We often picked fruits together, Nove had often tossed apples towards me, which I thought was rather odd, since no apple trees grow around us, but I chose not to think on it too much. As months went by, I fell in love with the 'son' of Aphrodite, just as the goddess herself intended. Everything went perfectly. Novellus adjusted to life as a human man and learned how to pick up on social cues. He took care of me every single day. In the winters, he would hardly leave my side. Seasons passed, and we both resided in our little home in the forest, selling some of the artwork to some locals in the town, and laying on the forest's soft grass base to watch the stars and the clouds each day. We loved each other, and always would until the end of time, and as for Novellus, he told me he would see me each and every day, until he couldn't. Even if he were going blind, he would never wish to look upon anything but me, which was far more than I ever could have asked for.    This is meant to be a short story. So there will be some time skips in this chapter.       within the year after I created him, he stayed with me. He refused to leave my side, and I don't think I wanted him to. I would say things like, ""Follow me. We are going to go pick up some foods from the city"" or maybe some days I would ask him to come with me to pick flowers and care for the wildlife and always.  Always  he would do it. He always went with me. That man is the best thing that has ever happened to me and everyday, I thank Aphrodite for granting him to me.            A year or two after that, things were great, but the fourth year after I created him, a war between the cities began. The Trojan war. It was horrible. Me and Novellus stayed in the countryside. We avoided the war, and the blood and gore as best we could. Nothing was worse than going into town and seeing men being carried into their homes, returning from the battlefield wounded or even dead. Blood dropped from their bodies as if it was water. It became so normal after a while, but people never stopped screaming. Their screams still ring in my ears sometimes. The children were always the worst to oversee. They cried. More than I thought was possible for any living thing. I felt sort of guilty- because I never had to worry about losing my lover. He was immortal. I don't think I could handle it if I lost him.            Months passed and it was fine- although the animals began to act weird. But only around our home. Plants started dying and we had to go further and further every time we needed to get some. It must be Artemis who has decided to cause havoc in the forest. It was well known that Aphrodite hated her because their beliefs were far different- as a result, she often killed Artemis' followers or made them fall in love, but I don't know why she would want anything to do with me or Novellus.            This went on for a very long time and the war got closer and closer to the town, and forest in which we resided. Novellus constantly offered to go and fight them off- to keep our home safe and protect me- but that was unnecessary. He insisted every day that he should go help fight the war. I was somewhat worried what that kind of experience would do to him. I knew he was immortal but an immortal life is not worth living if you are haunted by the lives you have taken.        ""My dove, let me go help the town fight. I cant die, you know that.""       ""I know, Nove, but I know what war does to people, and it's not worth it.""        ""Well then let me go aid the wounded""            I agreed to this idea because I know how desperately he wanted to help. It was torture to have to just stay on the side and watch people die and families mourn. He went to go help the injured every day he could, but the war drew closer. He left one morning a little earlier than usual to go help and I went into the other side of town to give some of the folks the plants I found deep in the gardens we grew, since our closer ones were dying. I liked to listen to the townspeople gossip as well. It was usually very interesting to hear but this time, it was anything but.        ""Did you hear? One of those woodland boys went to fight in the war""       I immediately stopped. My head turned like the shadow of a sundial.        ""What?""            When I spoke, I thought i sounded fine, but the lady I had said it to- the way she reacted seemed like she was looking at a child who burst into tears. She looked at me with such regret.        ""Oh wait! You're that boy! One of the ones from the fore-"" I cut her off.        ""What did you just say...""       ""I- uhh...did you not know? Your friend...he left for the war a few hours ago""           The way I stared at her must have made her feel some sort of sympathy because she looked like she wanted to rub my shoulder like distant relative would when they see you for the first time in a year.        ""What are you talking about?"" I responded sharply. My slight anger that he disobeyed me immediately changed to pure worry.        ""Well the war came closer to the woods first, and when he overheard that he immediately left towards it.""           There was such a mix of emotions I was feeling, and so many thoughts in my head that I couldn't hear what she was saying after that- I had tuned everything out. I wasn't in control of my body anymore. I blinked and I was running back home. I tripped over my own feet plenty of times and stumbled more than I could count. I couldn't see anymore. It was all so blurry and my face was wet. I was crying. Not crying. Sobbing. I made it to the field before the forest and already there were plenty of the dead. I ran there and I didn't see any living soldiers, only dead ones. Some from our army and some from the other's. When I tripped for the last time, it hurt to get up.            I glanced up from my spot on the ground and I saw him. He was knelt on the ground in front of the creek. The water ran red with blood. A doe was laying dead in the water. It was obvious the soldiers had no mercy for the animals. I tried to pick myself up and I managed to make it right next to him. He was frozen. He stared at the water and his hands were shaking.        ""Nove?""    ""Novellus!""             I shouted a bit as I shook him but he didn't respond. I turned and looked around as grabbed his hand and held it tightly. I could see the house was a mess, the door was broken and things had been shattered. The wildlife was almost all gone. I knew the doe that was in the creek, I knew half of these soldiers that were bleeding out onto the grass- painting it a shade of crimson.            I tried to get Novellus to get up and come inside with me- I even tried to take him to the town but he didn't move. After that, I gave up. I let my hand caress his left cheek and I wiped the blood off of his face, then the water was used to clean his hands. I cleaned his smooth skin of the blood and regret, but I knew he would be different after this. That's when I heard shouting. People shouting. More soldiers.            This bit was mostly blurry. One of the men tried to pull me away from him, but I screamed and cried and remained next to him. He was alive. I could feel his hand gripping mine, but he wasn't completely conscious. I pushed the soldier over and managed to knock him out. I tried once again to pull him. The only thing that left my mouth were soft mumbles and cries.       ""Novellus...please. You have to get up. Please.""            At that point I was on my feet, pulling at his arm- and then I wasn't. I felt a sharp pain in my gut and I fell to my knees again. I touched my stomach and it was blood. I was bleeding. Behind me was a soldier who had just removed his sword, freshly coated in my blood. I couldn't really speak- I just made incoherent soft whimpers and gasps of pain. It hurt. It hurt so bad.            That was when he turned around. He was finally conscious again, as I was being dragged by one of my arms, across the grass. There were about 3 soldiers there now. Novellus immediately grabbed the sword that had been next to him and sliced one of them completely in half, the second one was decapitated, and the last one, he stabbed him- in the same way I was stabbed. He knelt by my side and I cried softly.            My love tried to quiet me and calm me. He whispered and held me in his arms. I could tell he was panicked and manic. I paused after a while and winced. I nearly forgot I was bleeding. The only thing I could do was watch his face. His beautiful face. I could tell he knew I was in pain. He knew I was dying. But he refused to believe it.        ""Nove...""        ""No- shhh stop. Don't say anything- you're going to be fine.""            I held his cheek with as much strength as I could get and I pulled his face to mine. We were covered in dirt, blood and sweat. Our foreheads met and both of our eyes shut.            I heard him cry. I did not speak to him but I opened my eyes and pressed a kiss onto his lips and cried with him. There is a saying I've heard before. Est quaedam flere voluptas which translates to- there is a certain pleasure in weeping. there is.        ""You don't have to follow me this time, Nove""            After I spoke that he seemed to weep harder and hold me tighter. I couldn't really hear him. But he was speaking. It all became fuzzy.            I bleed the blood of man. I know this because i have seen it. I did not think I would belong in this world like others do, so I tried to leave. I am not an immortal creation of the gods like he is. I designed him and the gods granted my most valued wish. I worry what he will do when I've gone from here.             I'm sorry, my love- I know you will be upset with me, and then with the gods that created you. I am not meant to live forever, and you are not meant to die forever.                                 Last chapter Les gooooo       Even though I was gone, I still felt him holding me. When I died, I was allowed by the gods to watch over him for a while, though once I passed on, or given a new life, I would forget what I saw in these moments, there was so much I wanted to say.            He held my body for the longest time, while he wept. I've never seen him cry before. He screamed. He shouted for his mother, the one who gave him life- Aphrodite. He told her to bring me back, and then he begged her to end his life.            Aphrodite rarely ever answered wishes in person. But she stepped out into the forest from behind a tree. Near her, there was a Stag. She raised her arm and the deer approached the creek and sat. Everyone in the forest was in mourning.            The goddess then walked towards Novellus. She held his face with a gentle hand- like a motherly touch. Here, he begged her again, to kill him...to which she refused. He cried and didn't stop hugging my body.        ""Please mother!""            The man raised his hand and placed his palm over Aphrodite's hand that was on his face. She seemed empathetic.       ""You are not alone in your anguish, child, but a bitter heart eats its owner.""            Everyone knew about Aphrodite's experience with heartbreak and grief because of what happened to Adonis, but in this moment, he, of course was thinking selfishly. The ones who weep always claim no one knows how they feel, but she knows how you feel, beloved- I know how you feel.            I was reincarnated a few times and had some good lives but I never saw him again. There was not a single moment I didn't wish to somehow come across him and stay with him forever. It's the most painful when you remember everything. When you remember what his voice sounds like and how his hands felt holding you. I'm always going to try and go back to him. Every single time.           Dum Spiro Spero   ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;0;0;1;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
39728892;;;;;narrator;;;;;;unknown;;;;;;unknown;;;;;"     Before the Trojan war, but after Aphrodite and her lost love, Adonis, there was me. Luctus Sine Lumen. I have never found a place to belong with people, I reside far outside of Athens, along the edge of the woods near an eerie lake and a field of flowers. At this time I am about 22, My parents had never really been around. My mother left when I was young, and my father drank all the time so, I found my interest in painting and sculpting by the age of six.         No one ever seemed to really want to see my paintings, but I think they're pretty good. I never had any friends- ok well I had one. Adrina, but she was busy taking care of her new family- so I usually just talk to the gods. When my father was around, he told me to never depend on Aphrodite. He told me over and over again that she was good-for-nothing and claimed that love was a facade for fools that are enamored by others. My entire life, my father had belittled the goddess of love, and the idea of it in overall- since, of course, he had been left by his own love. Not that I care of course, I never really paid him any attention, but even then, i still don't really trust the idea of love. I've had crushes of course, but I've never confessed, or dated anyone, or gotten married. I've just been by myself.            My heart has always been in my sculptures and paintings. Never on people. When I was painting, my brush ran over my canvas several times again and again, until it was obvious that I was painting a woman. It was Aphrodite. I had no idea why I suddenly wanted to pay tribute to the goddess in such a manner, but I did so anyway. I suppose I had a childish idea of hope for true love. I spent days painting this woman. Her beauty in the painting was of course- unmatched, and she was watching. The gods could hear someone's prayers to them, their deepest desires, and even if i wasn't aware in the moment, there was the wish in the back of my mind that I would fall in love- maybe to someone as beautiful as the people in my portraits.                Aphrodite took great pleasure and pride in seeing such an act of devotion to her- even if I've never had the opportunity to go and rightfully pray in any of her temples, I still spent a very long time depicting someone of enormous perfection that looked similarly to the goddess. Because of this action, Aphrodite, who was of a great ego, felt the need to grant a wish of mine, and since I had longed deep down to feel what it is to be truly loved, she was going to prove she capable of granting such a desire.               Aphrodite had decided what she was going   to do for me so, she waited, and watched me for a while, catching all of my small comments about how i liked the different outcomes of different pieces. At one point, I had been sculpting the figure of a man, out of clay and rock. The goddess could hear all of my comments-- much to my dismay. Ones about how gorgeous this man was compared to all of the rest of humanity. It was then that she planned it out. On the first day of detailing this man, she would give the sculpture personality, on the second, compassion, the third, a brain, on the fourth, she gave him desire and love for his sculptor, on the very last day that I had worked on the sculpture, when I completed it, the goddess would give the statue life.             I threw myself forward slightly, just enough to wrap my arms around the sculpture. I had sat there for a while, until I felt the warmth of another's skin against my own, and until I felt the pressure of someone else's arms snaking around me. It's as if you can feel how genuine someone is by how they hug- how tightly, how long, and by what they say to you in such a situation. In this instance, what was said by him would stay with me for an eternity, long after I pass on.          ""I can see you...""               I took a minute, but when I finally let my eyes drift upwards, to see who was hugging me, my breath staggered a little and the corners my lips tugged hesitantly into a smile as my glossy, teary eyes swiftly cleared up. There I saw eyes of a deep green color- like jade stones. My eyes scanned around. I cant believe I didn't recognize him immediately. I designed him. The sharp jawline and the shape of this perfect nose belonged to my statue. I gasped and reached my hands up to touch the man's face. He was given life from Aphrodite,and he would from now on, only live for his sculptor. Always. Forever. I was speechless, but I could see the man's eyes looking at me, and then the creation spoke again,          ""You're...gorgeous""             I've never heard such a thing said to me before- under any circumstances at all ever- especially not by a man I sculpted and spent over a week to perfect....or by a man at all. My mouth opened slightly and I tried to stand myself up, earning the assistance of the other man. Once we were both stood up, I sort of regretted making him so muscular and tall. Outside the window were two crows. To avoid awkward eye contact, for a moment, I just stared out at the birds- watching as another bird joined, the three birds stood in the grass for quite a bit before two of them left, leaving one by itself in the field. After a few seconds of that, I turned back to the stranger, having worked up the courage to speak.         ""Do you have a name?"" I spoke in a little bit more of a hushed voice than the other man did-but even so, it was loud enough to hear         ""Aphrodite called me 'Novellus"""" the other responded. Novellus was a name that suited this man quite well- In my opinion at least.         ""Novellus. It is perfect. My name is Luctus. Luctus Sine Lumen"" I answered the taller man immediately.              After we introduced ourselves, I allowed Novellus to stay in my house with me. We often picked fruits together, Nove had often tossed apples towards me, which I thought was rather odd, since no apple trees grow around us, but I chose not to think on it too much.

48677368;;;;;speaker's son;;;;;;speaker's son;;;;;;killed;;;;;"I found myself becoming Menelaus. My husband tossed into a useless war, and then further, into unfriendly homes, taken in by wretched men and Gods. But never dead. Sing to me, Sacker of Cities, about a vagabond. He who was stolen by the sea, even as he trampled on the hearth of Troy, and his wife waited dutifully for his return. Always faithful. Always Penelope. One flesh, one bone, one heart, do you remember that I never loved you? No, I was you. Remember, roadless one, that the goddess of weaving is also my patron. I am also a liar.   I was queen Dido, I alone governed my kingdom, and we had never been more prosperous. Even the slaves ate well, and it was all due to my leadership.     It was noonday when you arrived, Aeneas, and your eyes glowed bright black, ensnaring me in the web your dutiful mother wove. Could you have not taken me without help?    I came to my senses after I died, of course, but you never did.You wanted me as your mistress even after I became a silent wraith.     I take some perverse happiness in knowing that your city too, will surely fall.      I was raped.     There, I've said it, the cat is out of the bag, the girl is out of Sparta, whatever you thought I did, you were wrong.     But did you really think it would be anything else? Paris was pretty, but he wasn't mine. None of them were, because you can't truly love a woman like you love gold.     That's what nobody seems to understand.     And what none of   you   seem to understand, not even after I'm dead and rotting in my grave, my dear suitors, is that I never chose to be beautiful. Give that role to Clytemnestra.    So I gave Helen to Paris. Okay, I'm a Goddess. What did you expect?     No,   I'm not every man's wish fulfillment wet dream given human form. Where on   earth   did you get that idea?     I'm the Goddess of sex, desire, and power. I stood over Ares with a sword on his chest when he propositioned me, and he knew I could leave him with a godly scar and it only excited him more. I stepped on his throat and he gagged and got hard underneath me.     So yes, I gave Helen to Paris. I'm a Goddess. What did you expect?    Can't we talk about something other than the various men we fucked?     No? I didn't think so. Those were the only unique things about our pitiful lives.     There's nothing I desperately want to say about Jason- He was a hero, I was forced to love him, he sailed away, he was a bad man. It's the gods I hate.     I never knew what lust was until they started meddling. Bodies disgusted me, I only wanted to tend to my herbs in peace. The Gods made my body desire Jason, but my mind revolted, even up until the day I died.     Stop making me a   victim.   God.     How many times do I have to say it to make it clear? He cried on the beach every night. I'm a god, and he was a mortal. Do the math. We women don't have to be the victims in every story, you know. Don't I get to follow my nature as a deity?    Does it make you uncomfortable that a woman could do that to a man instead of the other way around?    Make me a villain- it's the role I deserve. But do it right. I'm not just evil, I'm also powerful.        I bet you're wondering why I'm here. Or maybe you figured it out a long time ago, and you're simply laughing at my shame.     When did you get your doubts? Was it Pentheus? Ariadne? The Maenads? Or was it just my own sad nature?    I sometimes find myself becoming Aphrodite. Love, madness, beauty- it's all the same to me, it all leads to the same wild feast of tearing Orpheus into shreds. It's not in my nature to humiliate myself, but it's also not in my nature to be a man.     Now, what would you like to drink? Bourbon? Wine?     Dear father, I hope you die.    The people here are kind, and I wish I thought about you less than I do, but even now, you control the whole of Rome, reaching into parts of Egypt. Not the parts I'm in, I hope.     Your prodigal daughter, I would have gotten in the way of your godhood, bringing home both men and women with wild abandon.     I like to think you wouldn't have done this to me if you weren't Deus Romae,  but you would've. If you didn't have Agrippa, you could've saved some of your love to give to me.        I don't want to talk about it. Achilles and Agamemmnon, Chryses and the war and the plague. I was hidden inside a tent for most of it, anyway.    Days were good, nights were hell, I danced and cooked and wept for my Trojan sisters that were jailed like me.    I was beaten least out of all the girls. Achilles didn't like the look of bruises on me- my skin was too fair to hide the marks, and for all his faults, he wasn't a sadist. I was never an Athena or an Artemis. Just Hestia, a woman of the hearth.        Okay, Okay! I know what I did wasn't   mature.   But I was   right.   I don't regret the hill I chose to die under.     I punched Creon before I died. I fought right up until the end, even when he lowered me into my grave I was still screaming, damning him with every bit of breath I had, using my blood to seal that curse.     There's nothing worse than a disrespecter of the dead, you know? Killing is one thing-  eternal torment is  another.     I had a soft heart. If I hadn't died for Polyneices, I would have never slept again.     Oh Aphrodite,     I slept in gardens of roses, crowns of lavender on my head, and there was barley underneath her fingernails.     Is this the sorrow I must bear, Aphrodite? For I have been ensnared in a web of desire, and I see her lips, flushed and smiling, in my sleep.     I am sick on daisies-     Why was I cursed, Aphrodite, to love a woman who has pledged herself to Artemis, the moon-faced goddess?     Her skin reminds me of the sand, her eyes; the seashells, and when she speaks, the ocean roars.     Release me, Aphrodite! I am sick on her smile.    (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I am not ashamed to be a woman of the hearth. After all, we cannot all be Aphrodites, Artemises, Athenas. Some of us have to tend to the hearth.     Do I not belong in the list of women who have changed history? Am I not man enough? Am I too soft, peaceful, too willing to situate myself as a peacemaker rather than a fighter of the law?     I have no man and no woman. I have no mother and no father. I am   Hestia,   protector of the hearth, patron of unsatisfied young women and lover of light. I am Hestia.   Oh my god guys I've been writing this play about sappho and legit every page takes me a full hour to write, if not longer, because I have to translate all of the sappho fragments I want to use in the play and I'm piecing it altogether like a puzzle and anyway I really hope my friend knows someone who would want to put it on as a play. It's not my best work but it's certainly my hardest work.   So little is said about me, I wonder if I exist outside of Briseis and my father.     There's not much to say, really. I was just another one of the slave girls, nothing special about me except that somebody cared enough to come after me, and a god cared about him enough to let me free.     And isn't that the story of every woman in the war?     We were nothing, really. Just girls unlucky enough to be caught in the wrong place, and therefore, we were subject to the insatiable appetites of men no different than the men of Troy.     Frankly, what men do is their own concern. I cared about Polyneices, of course I did, do you think I'm some kind of   monster?   I just didn't think there was anything I could do without getting my own self killed.     Antigone proved that.     She always cared too much for her family, even when they didn't care for her.      I was a pragmatist. Get in, get out, try to have a little joy. Be ugly enough that nobody important  wants you, pretty enough to be married. In, out, done.     Antigone always had grander aspirations, which I think is what killed her.     Oh come on, I know how you people see me now. I used to be beautiful. Cow eyed, they called me. Now, I suppose I'm just another pinched-face nanny.     They have an   obsession,   down on earth. Either you're beautiful and free and young, or you're old and bitter and hateful. Tell me, was I any less vengeful than Aphrodite? Than Athena?     I loved Zeus. I loved his body, his power, his wars. I also loved   not having to win that love every single goddamn day.   And what do I get for that? I get called a prude and a shrew.         (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    It was a pithos I opened, which is different from a box. A box means curiosity. It means lack of restraint.     A   pithos   means I was just trying to get some oil, which makes it worse, in a way.     Every religion has a hungry woman at the base of it. She who wants to eat more than she wants to wait.     What is she waiting for? Her husband. He will provide food, provide glory, until the day he doesn't. If I was made to be a perfect slave to Zeus, why do I go to Hades because I was   hungry?    I wrote ""every religion has a hungry woman at the base of it"" and now I'm applying for a 1200 dollar research grant to talk about hunger and the feminine in greek mythos. I think I've really got something here. I expressed to my professor that I feel like it's not original and he said ""people have been studying this for 3000 years. You signed up to not be original."" So. I hope I get the money. I want a new computer.   What was I supposed to do? The last thing my husband did ere he set sail for Illium was to kill my child. He didn't kiss me goodbye, he didn't give his sons a parting word, no. He killed my daughter.     How is my daughter worth any less than Helen? They killed her for   Helen,   my own sister, who would have died easily for my daughter. Come to think of it, she would have died for less, but that's besides the point.     He killed my youngest daughter, that's a crime I can't forgive.  He murdered my Iphegenia in cold blood.        Here's a secret: I'm not a protector of girls. Oh sure, I'm wild and I'm woman  ,   but I was made by a man who told stories to a man who survived by the history of men and was placed into academia by men and for men, to be talked about and remade and written about by men.     So I'm the protector of virgins, not of women.     I care for the clean and the pure, for the young and the proper, for the women that are women that are hunters that are temple-worthy soft and beautiful.     The others go to Bacchus.        I begged you not to leave, Hector, I begged it of you. But no. You knew better, so you abandoned us in the castle, leaving me to nurse my son in his last hours alone, with no comfort and no protection as the wily man found me. I became a slave, Hector, the person you could not bear to see me become. I bore children for Greek men, your own son dead underneath the rubble of Troy, and for what? Your pride? You could have given Helen back yourself under cover of night if you really wanted me to live.        He left me on an island, and two days later, a wine god wants to make me his wife. I won't say anything unflattering about Bacchus- I wouldn't dare- But the men in my life have never once been a blessing.     Did you know that when I was little, I wanted to become a priestess? My father forbade it, because then he wouldn't have a girl to use as a pretty little pawn in his political games.     Maybe that's why I wanted Theseus's hand in marriage. To spite my family. Maybe I just wanted to leave that god damned island.     (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I might be the only one of these women who's gotten myself through life unscathed.     Unscathed, of course, being a relative term.     Here's the thing: I was mostly normal, and for all the women that Odysseus exchanged words with,   mostly   normal was good. It meant that I was half a human, and therefore I might not be wrapped up in the way of the gods. Making Odysseus walk behind me was the best choice I ever made in my sad, sorry life, and it might have been one of the only ones too.     Oh well. Count my blessings, I will.       My welsh teacher is going to teach me how to press grapes this weekend and thats somehow not the weirdest thing I'm dealing with   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    There is so little of me left, and what I have is saturated with pain. I wish I had written more. I wish I had written better. I wish what I had written had not been laced with honey-sweet sorrow, so thick and cloying that it melted away the better part of me. Grieving becoming my only bedfellow, and me, becoming more and more a part of the tenth muse- unwilling or unable to pull away from her. What could I have become, I wonder, if the loving part of me had survived? What kind of love could I give?      So the thing about erinna is that she's known for her sad poetry, right? Specifically about her lover, baucis. But we only have one bit of a bigger poem she wrong and three epigrams- everything else she wrote is lost. And it makes me think: yes, she wrote sad poetry but there must have been some glimmer of hope, had more of her writing survived. She must have written something good, and the amount of poetry that we lose to time is a tragedy in and of itself.   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I am a warrior with a sword, I have bested Ares in battle more times than I can count, I am Pallas Athena, the warrior maiden of wisdom, and the keeper of crafts from the lowest slave to the highest nobleman.     I am well renowned for having no mercy, I am tied to Odysseus in a way that I cannot escape, I loved his consort more.     It's a strange thing, to be a god and a servant at the same time. Strange, that my life still depends on wit and will, even now. Should not the world be my domain?    Athena is so interesting. She's a woman. She has no mother. She is a man in all the ways that it matters. She patronizes weaving. She patronizes war. She is the odysseus of the gods- who is another man-woman figure.   I told him not to go. He asked my advice, and I told him that going to see the man who killed my son would be stupid. But I was the stupid one, thinking that he would actually listen to me.     He was killed on the altar, right before I was killed just the same way, begging for mercy from the son of the man whose hands my husband kissed on the beach. Oh, what a tangled web we weave.     Like it could have been better- Troy was going to fall, whatever friends my husband made across no man's land.      What was there to complain of, except that she had been loved?      There was a lot to complain of. The horrible lot that I was dealt, for one, and the way that my husband wouldn't seem to give up, let me drink from the Lethe in peace. It was love, but it was that kind of destructive love that keeps your soul on earth far longer than necessary. The kind of love that kept Achilles from burying Patroclus until Hector was dead. I'm not angry, not exactly. I'm disappointed, and I'm sad, and I wish I had never met Orpheus.    I took on the role of Lesbia, of Cynthia, of Delia, I am nothing but a Gorgo to history anymore. A lament of poetry, remembered through my lover. Perhaps I should have done more.     I doubt that.     What else could I have done? I exchanged kisses with Erinna, she wrote about our childhood, running through the waves and splashing on the shore, and everything we have lost- death ruins it all, she said.     Did she mean to remember me through centuries of reinterpretation and language? Was I the lover she looked for in the smoke? Tell them- I am Baucis.     My son was stupid. But you already knew that.     I was given to Peleus as a war prize. But you already knew that, too. Here's something you don't know: I hated Achilles.     I loved him too, but I hated the parts of him that reminded me of Peleus, I hated his smile and his god-damned honor, I hated him, and I loved him with all the force of a mother unwilling to give up her son.     Maybe I wish I had a daughter.     Maybe that was why I tried to make him into one on Skyros, though it never worked.     (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I'm still out here, feeding pigs to men and making men into pigs, and I'm not sorry.     I know the ending of my story. I marry Telemachus, and who knows what happens after that? I don't matter beyond the family of Odysseus.     Kiss me and kill me, sail away- he wasn't a kind man, not in the slightest, which was unsurprising after all he went through. I was one of those trials, and I'm not sorry about that, either. Am I evil for fulfilling the purpose I was built for?     The most terrifying woman is a witch with a mouth.    Still waiting to see if I got that research grant to study women's mouths in greek literature.... I'm gonna check right after i post this   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)     I spoke the greek of the home, of the women who could not leave, of the trapped. But you, Pindar, you spoke the greek of the city-states and the streets. I worshiped the women and I was quiet, but I am content with that, though you are remembered better. Did you ever think to see echoes of us in our later iterations?     I have told stories from the coast of Mytilene to the shores of New York city. I have lived in homes abandoned and the fragrant crowns of Sappho have pillowed my fall.  And what has that made me?      If you haven't read corinna go do so. She's so good.   What is a Mark Antony to a powerful woman?     More power, of course. He sips at my pearls and wine, gets drunk on sex and power, all the while, Octavius takes the senate for his own.     You would think that the way I used both Julius and his adoptive son would have made me a more powerful figure in Roman history, but I just became the exotic slut.     We humans have always been the same, I suppose.     What am I to do? What role am I meant to play? And don't you dare tell me to be a woman again.     Women marry monsters. It's what we do.     Not by choice, mind you, and certainly not of our own volition. But men are the monsters that control our lives, and we bear their children and weave their clothes and send them off to war and rejoice when they die and then go on living with a strange sort of melancholy in our hearts.    Who can blame me for wanting to see the monster I married? To know if I married a monster?     Women marry monsters. It's what we do. I thought that I was smarter, but it was never  my choice.     I'll tear your flesh from your body, eat it raw and whole, soak you in unwatered wine and when you are tender and supple underneath my tongue, I will rip you to pieces and laugh.     I am not beholden to a man. There is no system that I serve. I am wild and free and like a puppet on a string, I must be an anti-woman.     You see, I am not a girl, not exactly. I am the image of one, the scarecrow of a maiden. In all the ways that it matters, I am quite clearly   not   a woman.        I'm actually rather proud of my son. Angry, yes, but proud. He grew into the man that I raised him to be.     That was, perhaps, an oversight on my part.     If you raise a monster you get a monster, if I raised a thief I got myself a thief, since I raised a murderer, he killed me and kept the secret badly.      I deserved it. We always do. But Nero grew into a woman, and that disappointed me, and I wonder if that says more about me or about him, that I will not let him be what I am.  ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule

If I was made to be a perfect slave to Zeus, why do I go to Hades because I was   hungry?    I wrote ""every religion has a hungry woman at the base of it"" and now I'm applying for a 1200 dollar research grant to talk about hunger and the feminine in greek mythos. I think I've really got something here. I expressed to my professor that I feel like it's not original and he said ""people have been studying this for 3000 years. You signed up to not be original."" So. I hope I get the money. I want a new computer.   What was I supposed to do? The last thing my husband did ere he set sail for Illium was to kill my child. He didn't kiss me goodbye, he didn't give his sons a parting word, no. He killed my daughter.     How is my daughter worth any less than Helen? They killed her for   Helen,   my own sister, who would have died easily for my daughter. Come to think of it, she would have died for less, but that's besides the point.     He killed my youngest daughter, that's a crime I can't forgive.  He murdered my Iphegenia in cold blood.        Here's a secret: I'm not a protector of girls. Oh sure, I'm wild and I'm woman  ,   but I was made by a man who told stories to a man who survived by the history of men and was placed into academia by men and for men, to be talked about and remade and written about by men.     So I'm the protector of virgins, not of women.     I care for the clean and the pure, for the young and the proper, for the women that are women that are hunters that are temple-worthy soft and beautiful.     The others go to Bacchus.        I begged you not to leave, Hector, I begged it of you. But no. You knew better, so you abandoned us in the castle, leaving me to nurse my son in his last hours alone, with no comfort and no protection as the wily man found me. I became a slave, Hector, the person you could not bear to see me become. I bore children for Greek men, your own son dead underneath the rubble of Troy, and for what? Your pride? You could have given Helen back yourself under cover of night if you really wanted me to live.        He left me on an island, and two days later, a wine god wants to make me his wife. I won't say anything unflattering about Bacchus- I wouldn't dare- But the men in my life have never once been a blessing.     Did you know that when I was little, I wanted to become a priestess? My father forbade it, because then he wouldn't have a girl to use as a pretty little pawn in his political games.     Maybe that's why I wanted Theseus's hand in marriage. To spite my family. Maybe I just wanted to leave that god damned island.     (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I might be the only one of these women who's gotten myself through life unscathed.     Unscathed, of course, being a relative term.     Here's the thing: I was mostly normal, and for all the women that Odysseus exchanged words with,   mostly   normal was good. It meant that I was half a human, and therefore I might not be wrapped up in the way of the gods. Making Odysseus walk behind me was the best choice I ever made in my sad, sorry life, and it might have been one of the only ones too.     Oh well. Count my blessings, I will.       My welsh teacher is going to teach me how to press grapes this weekend and thats somehow not the weirdest thing I'm dealing with   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    There is so little of me left, and what I have is saturated with pain. I wish I had written more. I wish I had written better. I wish what I had written had not been laced with honey-sweet sorrow, so thick and cloying that it melted away the better part of me. Grieving becoming my only bedfellow, and me, becoming more and more a part of the tenth muse- unwilling or unable to pull away from her. What could I have become, I wonder, if the loving part of me had survived? What kind of love could I give?      So the thing about erinna is that she's known for her sad poetry, right? Specifically about her lover, baucis. But we only have one bit of a bigger poem she wrong and three epigrams- everything else she wrote is lost. And it makes me think: yes, she wrote sad poetry but there must have been some glimmer of hope, had more of her writing survived. She must have written something good, and the amount of poetry that we lose to time is a tragedy in and of itself.   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I am a warrior with a sword, I have bested Ares in battle more times than I can count, I am Pallas Athena, the warrior maiden of wisdom, and the keeper of crafts from the lowest slave to the highest nobleman.     I am well renowned for having no mercy, I am tied to Odysseus in a way that I cannot escape, I loved his consort more.     It's a strange thing, to be a god and a servant at the same time. Strange, that my life still depends on wit and will, even now. Should not the world be my domain?    Athena is so interesting. She's a woman. She has no mother. She is a man in all the ways that it matters. She patronizes weaving. She patronizes war. She is the odysseus of the gods- who is another man-woman figure.   I told him not to go. He asked my advice, and I told him that going to see the man who killed my son would be stupid. But I was the stupid one, thinking that he would actually listen to me.     He was killed on the altar, right before I was killed just the same way, begging for mercy from the son of the man whose hands my husband kissed on the beach. Oh, what a tangled web we weave.     Like it could have been better- Troy was going to fall, whatever friends my husband made across no man's land.      What was there to complain of, except that she had been loved?      There was a lot to complain of. The horrible lot that I was dealt, for one, and the way that my husband wouldn't seem to give up, let me drink from the Lethe in peace. It was love, but it was that kind of destructive love that keeps your soul on earth far longer than necessary. The kind of love that kept Achilles from burying Patroclus until Hector was dead. I'm not angry, not exactly. I'm disappointed, and I'm sad, and I wish I had never met Orpheus.    I took on the role of Lesbia, of Cynthia, of Delia, I am nothing but a Gorgo to history anymore. A lament of poetry, remembered through my lover. Perhaps I should have done more.     I doubt that.     What else could I have done? I exchanged kisses with Erinna, she wrote about our childhood, running through the waves and splashing on the shore, and everything we have lost- death ruins it all, she said.     Did she mean to remember me through centuries of reinterpretation and language? Was I the lover she looked for in the smoke? Tell them- I am Baucis.     My son was stupid. But you already knew that.     I was given to Peleus as a war prize. But you already knew that, too. Here's something you don't know: I hated Achilles.     I loved him too, but I hated the parts of him that reminded me of Peleus, I hated his smile and his god-damned honor, I hated him, and I loved him with all the force of a mother unwilling to give up her son.     Maybe I wish I had a daughter.     Maybe that was why I tried to make him into one on Skyros, though it never worked.     (See the end of the chapter for notes.)    I'm still out here, feeding pigs to men and making men into pigs, and I'm not sorry.     I know the ending of my story. I marry Telemachus, and who knows what happens after that? I don't matter beyond the family of Odysseus.     Kiss me and kill me, sail away- he wasn't a kind man, not in the slightest, which was unsurprising after all he went through. I was one of those trials, and I'm not sorry about that, either. Am I evil for fulfilling the purpose I was built for?     The most terrifying woman is a witch with a mouth.    Still waiting to see if I got that research grant to study women's mouths in greek literature.... I'm gonna check right after i post this   (See the end of the chapter for notes.)     I spoke the greek of the home, of the women who could not leave, of the trapped. But you, Pindar, you spoke the greek of the city-states and the streets. I worshiped the women and I was quiet, but I am content with that, though you are remembered better. Did you ever think to see echoes of us in our later iterations?     I have told stories from the coast of Mytilene to the shores of New York city. I have lived in homes abandoned and the fragrant crowns of Sappho have pillowed my fall.  And what has that made me?      If you haven't read corinna go do so. She's so good.   What is a Mark Antony to a powerful woman?     More power, of course. He sips at my pearls and wine, gets drunk on sex and power, all the while, Octavius takes the senate for his own.     You would think that the way I used both Julius and his adoptive son would have made me a more powerful figure in Roman history, but I just became the exotic slut.     We humans have always been the same, I suppose.     What am I to do? What role am I meant to play? And don't you dare tell me to be a woman again.     Women marry monsters. It's what we do.     Not by choice, mind you, and certainly not of our own volition. But men are the monsters that control our lives, and we bear their children and weave their clothes and send them off to war and rejoice when they die and then go on living with a strange sort of melancholy in our hearts.    Who can blame me for wanting to see the monster I married? To know if I married a monster?     Women marry monsters. It's what we do. I thought that I was smarter, but it was never  my choice.     I'll tear your flesh from your body, eat it raw and whole, soak you in unwatered wine and when you are tender and supple underneath my tongue, I will rip you to pieces and laugh.     I am not beholden to a man. There is no system that I serve. I am wild and free and like a puppet on a string, I must be an anti-woman.     You see, I am not a girl, not exactly. I am the image of one, the scarecrow of a maiden. In all the ways that it matters, I am quite clearly   not   a woman.        I'm actually rather proud of my son. Angry, yes, but proud. He grew into the man that I raised him to be.     That was, perhaps, an oversight on my part.     If you raise a monster you get a monster, if I raised a thief I got myself a thief, since I raised a murderer, he killed me and kept the secret badly.      I deserved it. We always do. But Nero grew into a woman, and that disappointed me, and I wonder if that says more about me or about him, that I will not let him be what I am.  ";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
38985855;;;;;girl;;;;;;Artemis;;;;;;violation;;;;;"Artemis watched as her huntresses practiced their archery. They were the finest archers that the world had ever seen. They could hunt and track for leagues without issue. Even the devotees of her brother and rival, Apollo, could not match the skill of these women here. Plus, without the interruptions of men, these women had nothing to focus on but honing their skills. These mountains of forestry were true paradise for her. Though she would be lying if she said that she did not have other purposes for acquiring the most beautiful women she could find and training them to be her devotees. Even though she was supposed to be one of the divine maidens, she could not help but be tempted by these gorgeous women. She wanted them, wanted to claim them. Sitting in her temple, Artemis contemplated how she was going to get her first concubine. These huntress had been taught that their femininity and virginity was sacred and that none were supposed to take it. She would now have to find a way to get them to believe otherwise.   Then lightning struck her brain as an idea came to her. She could host a grand challenge, a competition and the winner would spend a night with her in the temple alone. She would promise it would be a night of great boons and honor. A prize worth a thousand lifetimes. That would entice even the most reluctant to compete she thought. Though the competition mattered little other than getting one of them to stay with her for a night. Walking out of her temple, she quickly put on her loincloth, barely able to contain her excitement. Holding up her hand to the sky as she called out,   ""Huntresses! Come to me!""   Once they were all assembled, she smiled.   ""I am going to host a very special challenge. A hunt unlike any I've ever had you do, tracking a beast deadlier than any you've ever faced. Any of you can choose to abstain from the challenge if you wish, but those of you who compete have a chance for a boon worth more than any gold or jewels. A night with me showered in my splendor and a gift worthy of a goddess. She smiled, proud of her con.   ""What say you?""   She asked before giving any further details.  Out of the many hunters she had, most were weary of their goddesses objective. Some of the older girls knew the goddess was usually hiding a trick or two up her sleeve when it came to granting rewards and boons. But in the end, three of the girls offered themselves for the task, willing to go out and hunt the beast like no other in hopes of pleasing their patron....  That had been two weeks ago. And now, the lone survivor of the girls had returned with a Griffins coat in tow and her body fully battleworn. She presented the coat of intricate feathers to her goddess and immediately felt cleansed of all dirt and grime from simply being in Artemis' luminous presence.   ""My lady..... might I claim the boon now and share your company within your temple?""  Caeda requested softly, keeping her head bowed whilst kneeling at the steps leading up to Artemis' temple.  Seeing the Griffin coat, it made her smile, as Artemis already had plans for what she could do with it. Slaying a griffin was no small task for a mortal, and to do it alone where others had failed, that was no small boast. This woman indeed was a strong huntress and warrior. The thought of fucking this woman, robbing her of her precious virtue, it was thrilling to her. She could barely contain her desire and her lust. She watched as the girl's wounds vanished, her strength returning and fatigue fading. At the girl's words, she beckoned her to follow with the motion of a single finger. Then she turned and entered the temple. With her back to the girl, she immediately took off her loincloth and then spoke.   ""You shall indeed receive the boon of my company and your gift, but this is my temple and we do not allow things like clothes or armor to be worn in these sacred halls. This is a place of nature, and as such we are to be as nature made us.""   Artemis spoke in a clear tone, looking over her shoulder and waiting to see the young girl strip.   ""I'm waiting.""   She drawled impatiently, twisting her back a bit more and folding her arms across her busty chest. Still, she kept the swollen rod between her legs hidden for the most part.  Caeda followed silently up the polished marble staircase, in awe at the power radiating from the staircase alone. Once she was at the entrance, her cheeks burned a deep crimson as the goddess commanded her to disrobe.   ""...a-as you wish my lady...""  Caeda murmured softly. She began to pull off her armor and weapons, setting them down before her clothing fell away as well and her nude body showcased the faint scars that littered her skin. She wore them proudly, having gained them in the servitude of her goddess after all. Caeda walked up to the goddess and shuddered at the cool breeze that entered the temple around them, causing her nipples to harden significantly.   ""....what now my goddess...""  Seeing the girl's young, slender, and muscular form before her, she could not wait any longer. She needed her now. She grabbed the girl by the throat, lifting her off the ground and carrying her over to the bedchamber that had been prepared for the Goddess, even though she did not need sleep. She smirked as she forcefully slammed her down onto the bed. She moved her body next to the girl's head, letting her see the monster of a shaft that was pointing out from her pelvis. With a chuckle, she looked at the girl.   ""You get your 'gift' of motherhood. You will be the first to bear the child of Artemis!""   Then she moved over top of the teen, straddling her legs and holding them together with her own stronger legs. Sure, it would be easier to penetrate her with her legs spread, but she did not want this to be easy, plus doing so would have made it less painful for the girl as well.   ""You're going to bear me a strong, beautiful line of daughters... you'll be part of my finest breeding stock now..""  Artemis breathed out heavily.  ""Aren't you?""   Her tone was full of challenge as she looked down on her seventeen year old maiden.   Caeda's hands shot out, holding tightly at Artemis' godly grip around her throat, fearing for her life in that moment until she was thrown into the deity's bed and pinned.   ""My lady no! Not my virtue!""  She reasoned, trying to push the unmoveable weight of the goddess from overtop of her naked body. Caeda had no luck in moving Artemis, so she grasped desperately for the edge of the bed, pulling herself with all of her strength until her body roughly turned and she tried to get away, feeling the godly monster of a penis slap between her firm asscheeks instead. This also gave an easier route to her hairless pussy without having to spread her legs at all.  ""Let me go! Goddess please!""  Caeda couldn't move anymore, Artemis' godly weight growing heavier with the more she resisted.  The goddess looked down as the woman begged, trying to push herself free. She smirked, just the sheer fact that she would try to deny a goddess showed more fighting spirit than most mortals. She would indeed bear a strong, powerful child. Though, resistance cannot be tolerated. She smacks the girl firmly across the face as she growls in her ear.   ""You will do as your goddess commands. Do not question me again.""   She hissed in a stern, almost cruel tone.   Seeing the bare pussy on full display for her, she placed a hand on the girl's lower back and pushed down a bit, making her bend more. Then she took her hand and ran it along the girl's slit. Glistening juices immediately coated her finger, and as she sucked her finger clean the divine taste had her moaning in bliss.   ""You act like you don't want this, but your body tells the truth.""   She placed the tip of her cock against the hole, then pressed just enough that the head would start to spread her lips but not fully enter her.   ""Do you love your goddess?""   Artemis asked curiously with a smirk.  Caeda's nipples hardened painfully as a chain reaction to the contact of Artemis' fat cock head pressed up against her cunt. She shuddered and let the tears flow freely, the tear droplets wetting the bed as her womb began to burn. Being in the presence of a fertility goddess whom intended to breed caused her womb to eagerly ready itself to create life from the potential divine seed.   ""....please goddess.... I love my goddess... don't do this to me!""  Caeda's voice cracked as she begged. She was shaking as her wet cunt began to spread, not putting up the slightest fight against the godly cock that was going to enter her.  The goddess just watched as she saw the girl sobbing onto the bed. She smacked her ass firmly with one hand an then continued to push her hips further down. First, the cock head entered the narrow, human passage. It was a good thing her walls were so wet and had already started stretching for her. She could hardly contain herself, but she did not want this over quickly. Artemis wanted to savor every one of this girl's reactions. She wanted to take her time with this oro huntress. She started kissing her neck as she slowly slipped deeper until she met a bit of resistance and smirked.   ""Push your hips towards me and rip your virtue on my cock, or I'm going to get very rough with you.""   Artemis then smacked the girl's ass for emphasis. Her cock was already throbbing in the tight, wet canal.   ""You thought I gather women as gorgeous and powerful as yourself with no intention ofclaiming them? Don't tell me you're that naive.""  Caeda gasped out, her body trembling as she pushed up on her hands, wincing from the ass jiggling slap. She didn't want to anger her goddess, the love she held for the moon deity outweighed the fear and anger she felt about losing her virtue.   ""Y-Yes m'lady...""  Her hips shifted as she pushed up on her palms and then rocked a little bit, flinching from how painful the cock felt inside of her stretched out cunt. Taking a deep breath, she suddenly went for it, slamming her hips back fully and destroying her hymen. A loud cry escaped pass her lips and she slumped down into the bed again, blood coating the goddesses cock as proof of her virtue sacrifice to her patron.   Whilst outside of the temple, some of the huntresses avoided the suspicious cries of their sister in the temple being raped by the moon goddess.  Artemis was loving this, the loyal obedience, the unquestioning loyalty. This girl did not want to be fucked, did not want her virtue taken, but because her patron goddess had demanded it, she sacrificed her virginity to the mammoth rod of her goddess. The feeling of the fat, juicy toned ass slamming against her pelvis felt incredible, and she loved the way it jiggled from the impact. Then as the goddess leaned herself forward, a wide smile grew across Artemis' face, seeing the blood trailing down her shaft.   ""Such an obedient little slut.""   She said and smacked the girl's ass, this time far more playfully.   Then she pushed the teen's head down onto the bed, and let her hand run down the girl's back to her waist.   ""But we're not done yet.""   She grabbed Caeda's hips in both hands, pulling them back roughly and began to thrust, her balls slapping loudly, painfully against the girl's clit. She did not care that the girl screamed, she did not care if the huntresses outside grew curious. Right now, she had a fertile female to breed, one whose body was more than accommodating her every need. She slammed in faster and faster, knowing her balls would bruise the girl's clit, just like her rod would bruise her cervix. Artemis moaned as her cock began to throb.   ""Are you ready for my seed? Are you ready to bear my child?""  Artemis moaned, lowering her lips to Caeda's ear and licking the lobe lightly.   Said girl huffed into the bed, breasts swaying and jiggling with every thrust. She felt herself burning from the inside out, the goddesses girth incredibly hot and pulsating wildly in her cunt. There was truly no stopping the goddess. Not when she seemed to have a very clear mission at hand.   ""....my lady.... please....""  Caeda pleaded, gasping out haggardly as her pelvis bulged with every thrust, accommodating such a large cock. To carry a god's offspring should be the biggest honor, but she felt more terrified than anything.   From across the temple bed chambers, Artemis had a secret audience of one of the younger Huntresses. She was only ten years old, Vivian was her name. The child was wide eyed in wonder, watching the goddess make her sister huntress moan and cry into the large bed. Viv was so confused by what was going on.  The way her body felt was incredible, Artemis had begun to see why men seemed so obsessed with conquering women. In fact, she was beginning to wonder if she should just breed all her huntresses and then go out and find more. The more she slammed into this girl, the more her balls ached and her cock throbbed. She gripped the teen by the back of the head, pushing her hard into the mattress. She began slamming her hips into her with all the force she could muster.   ""You don't have to beg me to breed you, lovely. That's what I'm going to do!""   Then at last she began to cum, shooting rope after rope of a thick golden cream into the girls cunt. She did not stop thrusting, letting her juices run out of the girl and onto the bed beneath them. Then she smiled when she finally pulled out, shooting more of her spunk over Caeda's raped body.   ""You're the first to be blessed by my seed dear, but make sure you tell no one of what happened. Am I clear?""  Caeda's womb accepted the seed hungrily, causing her belly to glow softly before the light began fading as Artemis' cock pulled out of her stretched pussy. Godly seed oozed out of her gaping cunt as sobs wracked the teens sweaty body and she fisted the bedsheets in defeat. It took her a few minutes to recover before she was able to get up from the bed, bowing in respect to her goddess before hurrying out of the temple with tears in her hazel eyes. Caeda dressed quickly at the temple stairs and avoided the gaze of all the other huntresses whilst striking out to go hunt something and burn away some anger.   ""M'lady.... why was Caeda crying?""  Vivian spoke up, coming out of the shadows and playing with the hem of her dress. She really should not have been spying on them.  The goddess was pleased with her self. Despite the fact that she had just committed one of the acts that she claimed only men would do to these huntresses, the rush she felt from it was incredible. Her desire to further ruin and mate with more of her huntresses increased exponentially. She wanted to break someone. Then she heard a small, timid voice. Her eyes went wide with panic and anger. She grabbed the small child by the back of her neck.  ""YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU ARE NEVER TO ENTER MY CHAMBERS WITHOUT PERMISSION!""  Her voice rang out, filling the entire room. She backhanded the girl across the face before throwing her face down onto the bed.   ""You will speak when spoken to. This was a training exercise for Caeda, she failed. Let's see if your will is stronger.""   It was of course a lie, but the child was likely too naiive to know that. She growled as she slapped the kid firmly on her ass once, then again and again. Grabbing the panties of the young girl, she ripped them off. Then she began to spank the girl's bare ass, turning it pink.   ""Beg for my forgiveness! Beg to be spared from my wrath!""  Vivian screamed out, not one for pain tolerance like the older girls as she was spanked ruthlessly with her heavy handed goddess. The child sobbed and trembled in the bed, kicking her legs every so often to try and scoot away from the lust hungry moon goddess.   ""I'm sorry! M'lady! Sorry!""  Viv cried out, her red butt jiggling as she kicked away again but couldn't get very far. It was like a game of cat and mouse, the goddess was simply toying with her until she decided what to do with her.   ""F-Forgive me!""  She hicupped, burying her watery eyes and red face against the bed covers to try and muffle the cries that were escaping her soft lips...  The goddess, seething from rage, still spanked the child's ass while she begged until the skin was glowing red and would sting when touched. Afterwards, she laid the child flat on the bed, rolling her onto her back, knowing that her now sore ass was going to be pressed into the mattress, causing her pain. Then she ripped open the girl's dress with one hand. The petite body made a smile grow across Artemis face. Looking down at the girl's tiny bare cunt, she licked her lips.   ""I'm going to make you stronger too...""   She grabbed the girl by the throat as she began to rub her cock on the girl's slit. It was still slick with the mixture of her cum and Caeda's juices. The thought of adding Caeda's juices into this girl made her smirk.   ""You want to be a strong huntress, don't you?""  Artemis waited for the child's answer, but once she got it, she began to squeeze the girl's throat. She cut off her air supply as she got ready to shove her cock in. There would be no screaming this time. She did not want to risk someone older and less gullible walking in. Wasting no more time, she began to push her hips against the girl. Her tiny pussy seemed far too small for the huge cock. At first she was just pushing against the surface as the hole seemed to refuse to give. Then finally with enough pressure, she forced her way in. She did not stop, she completely buried herself in this girl, shredding her hymen and causing her stomach to bulge up nearly to her chest.  Sad as it was to admit, the ten year old was far to caught up in the tunnel vision consuming her vision, to fully process the blinding pain that was following as her cunt was forcefully ripped into, way more blood soaking the goddesses divine cock and acting as a decent lubricant. As her organs rearranged, most likely bruising internally, a cold chill filled the room quite suddenly. It wrapped around the pair and was followed by the scent of insence and strong masculine cologne.   ""You're proving to be a much more interesting niece than any other I've had the pleasure of watching grow into godhood.""  That voice, bone chilling and deep as it was, belonged to none other than the god of the underworld, Hades himself. Cold and strong, his hand wrapped around Artemis' slender throat, his jewelled rings digging against her luminous flesh. Hades was one of the big three, he was not a weak god in any way or form.   ""...look at you.... choking this child to the brink of death... your power precedes you Artemis.... so let me fix that...""  Hades' clothing shimmered in black smoke, baring his naked body to the temple as he forced Artemis to slam down onto the bed, lodging her cock even further up the child's ripped cunt as he mounted her from behind and unceremoniously began choking her lightly as his monstrous cock began to invade her sacred untouched cunt.   "".....take my cock like a godly whore....""  Hades hissed before slamming his hips into her, lodging his dick balls deep into her cunt. He was stretching her so much, her gold blood drenching his cock and dripping down his hairy ballsack as he began to thrust into her. Every hump causing her to push into the girl beneath them as he chose to rape the moon goddess and be the one god that ever claimed her cunt virginity.  She kissed the girl as she ravaged and raped her small, helpless form. Pushing her tongue into the girl's mouth, her power would keep the girl alive, even if she was literally killing her by choking her. The thrill of holding such a power over someone so innocent gave her a dark and sinister pleasure.   Though speaking of dark and sinister, when the voice that could only be Hades, emerged from the darkness, a chill went up her spine. Lord Hades, king of the underworld, god of the dead had arrived in her sacred grove. Her arousal from the very presence of this man caused her cock to grow longer and her cunt to drool more than it already was. When he grabbed her throat, his rings digging into her neck, she was all but his. He could have done anything in this moment and she would have begged and thanked him for it. Often, her dreams had been filled by being defiled by one of the big three, the most common of these dreams had been Hades. Despite what everyone often said about him, she knew Hades was not evil. Cruel, demanding, powerful, yes, but not evil. Death was fair, so the god of the dead was the same. The child's tears streamed down her face as she was ripped and torn beyond all belief as the power of two gods thrusting into her nearly broke her tiny frame. Even her hips had dislocated, but then were being healed by the power Artemis held over the female form. When Hades' grip slacked just enough for her to speak she whispered.   ""T-thank you, m'lord.""  Artemis' insides felt like a cold fire was burning inside of her. The savage pain of Hades cock ripping her virginity was a divine horror. It was heaven and hell, agony and ecstasy. And with each thrust, she got to break this girl some more. Finally she began to cum, filling this girl with her seed, but then glanced back at Hades.   ""Her... ass... put me.... in... her ass, please....""  Her voice begged to destroy this girl's more sinful hole.  Hades however did not care for Artemis' request, but rather cloaked the woman's dick in darkness and caused it to press through shadows, reappearing against her own butthole as if through a portal.   ""Stick it in your own ass, you filthy freak.""  He growled against her ear, slapping her butt hard and watching her own cock begin to thrust lewdly up into her unprepared ass. He shuddered at the power he held over her, grabbing her hips and pulling her back roughly against his cock rapidly. His eyes closed as he focused on his own pleasure, using her body for his own whims. The same way she had done the small trembling girl beneath her. Whatever her name was, Hades took pity on her, combining his healing with hers and healing the girl until it left her in a dreamless sleep on the same bed they were fucking on like animals.  Being fucked by Hades was everything she could ever want and more. He was cold and degrading. Feeling the shadows move her cock, she did not know what else to say or do. She simply obeyed. She shoved her hips forward, and as they did, her cock rammed into her own unused, unlubed ass. The only slight relief was the blood and cum that was already on her shaft. She violated herself, the thick cock stretching her hole to the point of ripping. The power of Hades' thrusts forcing her to her knees and elbows. Then Artemis began to feel a tugging on her nipple, followd by fluid rushing out of it. Her eyes went wider.  ""Th-this is... not... allowed.... she's... drinking my... milk.""   It was one of the rules that she had made, even though she was a goddess of fertility and an eternal virgin, her body always produced milk and she had forbidden humans from ever tasting it.   ""I... must... be better... than.... that whore... Persephone...""  Hades seemed unamused by the young girl that was latched on to Artemis' breast, suckling her milk desperately. He lifted a hand, redressing her in the guise of shadows and returning her to the warmth of her own bed somewhere in the huntress camp down below. He then summoned Cerberus in his puppy form, smirking down at Artemis' as the three headed puppy sniffed around her boobs and two out of the three heads latched on to a nipple each, suckling more ravenously than the human child had been. They weren't even gentle about their claws either, pawing against her large milk sagging breasts and hungrily drinking her milk like they were starving.   ""Who knew, you'd be a useful cow yet.""  Hades mocked, encircling Artemis' flat and toned belly with his cold hands. A devious smile filtered across his lips as he thrusted into her a few more times and then began to cum, seeding her womb with his potent load, caressing her belly as it began to swell and swell until life could definitely be felt inside. Godly pregnancies were instantaneous, which was why he seemed so smug as he pulled out of her, watching his cum dribble out of her ruined cunt.  ""I hope childbirth is especially agonizing for you... maybe Hera will make sure to it..""  Hades smirked, dissolving into shadows along with Cerberus, back to the pits of the underworld he had come from. The shadows around her cock disappeared, making her erection swing between her thighs, going immediately limp...";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
38985855;;;;;Artemis' virginity;;;;;;Hades;;;;;;spiritual death;;;;;"Artemis watched as her huntresses practiced their archery. They were the finest archers that the world had ever seen. They could hunt and track for leagues without issue. Even the devotees of her brother and rival, Apollo, could not match the skill of these women here. Plus, without the interruptions of men, these women had nothing to focus on but honing their skills. These mountains of forestry were true paradise for her. Though she would be lying if she said that she did not have other purposes for acquiring the most beautiful women she could find and training them to be her devotees. Even though she was supposed to be one of the divine maidens, she could not help but be tempted by these gorgeous women. She wanted them, wanted to claim them. Sitting in her temple, Artemis contemplated how she was going to get her first concubine. These huntress had been taught that their femininity and virginity was sacred and that none were supposed to take it. She would now have to find a way to get them to believe otherwise.   Then lightning struck her brain as an idea came to her. She could host a grand challenge, a competition and the winner would spend a night with her in the temple alone. She would promise it would be a night of great boons and honor. A prize worth a thousand lifetimes. That would entice even the most reluctant to compete she thought. Though the competition mattered little other than getting one of them to stay with her for a night. Walking out of her temple, she quickly put on her loincloth, barely able to contain her excitement. Holding up her hand to the sky as she called out,   ""Huntresses! Come to me!""   Once they were all assembled, she smiled.   ""I am going to host a very special challenge. A hunt unlike any I've ever had you do, tracking a beast deadlier than any you've ever faced. Any of you can choose to abstain from the challenge if you wish, but those of you who compete have a chance for a boon worth more than any gold or jewels. A night with me showered in my splendor and a gift worthy of a goddess. She smiled, proud of her con.   ""What say you?""   She asked before giving any further details.  Out of the many hunters she had, most were weary of their goddesses objective. Some of the older girls knew the goddess was usually hiding a trick or two up her sleeve when it came to granting rewards and boons. But in the end, three of the girls offered themselves for the task, willing to go out and hunt the beast like no other in hopes of pleasing their patron....  That had been two weeks ago. And now, the lone survivor of the girls had returned with a Griffins coat in tow and her body fully battleworn. She presented the coat of intricate feathers to her goddess and immediately felt cleansed of all dirt and grime from simply being in Artemis' luminous presence.   ""My lady..... might I claim the boon now and share your company within your temple?""  Caeda requested softly, keeping her head bowed whilst kneeling at the steps leading up to Artemis' temple.  Seeing the Griffin coat, it made her smile, as Artemis already had plans for what she could do with it. Slaying a griffin was no small task for a mortal, and to do it alone where others had failed, that was no small boast. This woman indeed was a strong huntress and warrior. The thought of fucking this woman, robbing her of her precious virtue, it was thrilling to her. She could barely contain her desire and her lust. She watched as the girl's wounds vanished, her strength returning and fatigue fading. At the girl's words, she beckoned her to follow with the motion of a single finger. Then she turned and entered the temple. With her back to the girl, she immediately took off her loincloth and then spoke.   ""You shall indeed receive the boon of my company and your gift, but this is my temple and we do not allow things like clothes or armor to be worn in these sacred halls. This is a place of nature, and as such we are to be as nature made us.""   Artemis spoke in a clear tone, looking over her shoulder and waiting to see the young girl strip.   ""I'm waiting.""   She drawled impatiently, twisting her back a bit more and folding her arms across her busty chest. Still, she kept the swollen rod between her legs hidden for the most part.  Caeda followed silently up the polished marble staircase, in awe at the power radiating from the staircase alone. Once she was at the entrance, her cheeks burned a deep crimson as the goddess commanded her to disrobe.   ""...a-as you wish my lady...""  Caeda murmured softly. She began to pull off her armor and weapons, setting them down before her clothing fell away as well and her nude body showcased the faint scars that littered her skin. She wore them proudly, having gained them in the servitude of her goddess after all. Caeda walked up to the goddess and shuddered at the cool breeze that entered the temple around them, causing her nipples to harden significantly.   ""....what now my goddess...""  Seeing the girl's young, slender, and muscular form before her, she could not wait any longer. She needed her now. She grabbed the girl by the throat, lifting her off the ground and carrying her over to the bedchamber that had been prepared for the Goddess, even though she did not need sleep. She smirked as she forcefully slammed her down onto the bed. She moved her body next to the girl's head, letting her see the monster of a shaft that was pointing out from her pelvis. With a chuckle, she looked at the girl.   ""You get your 'gift' of motherhood. You will be the first to bear the child of Artemis!""   Then she moved over top of the teen, straddling her legs and holding them together with her own stronger legs. Sure, it would be easier to penetrate her with her legs spread, but she did not want this to be easy, plus doing so would have made it less painful for the girl as well.   ""You're going to bear me a strong, beautiful line of daughters... you'll be part of my finest breeding stock now..""  Artemis breathed out heavily.  ""Aren't you?""   Her tone was full of challenge as she looked down on her seventeen year old maiden.   Caeda's hands shot out, holding tightly at Artemis' godly grip around her throat, fearing for her life in that moment until she was thrown into the deity's bed and pinned.   ""My lady no! Not my virtue!""  She reasoned, trying to push the unmoveable weight of the goddess from overtop of her naked body. Caeda had no luck in moving Artemis, so she grasped desperately for the edge of the bed, pulling herself with all of her strength until her body roughly turned and she tried to get away, feeling the godly monster of a penis slap between her firm asscheeks instead. This also gave an easier route to her hairless pussy without having to spread her legs at all.  ""Let me go! Goddess please!""  Caeda couldn't move anymore, Artemis' godly weight growing heavier with the more she resisted.  The goddess looked down as the woman begged, trying to push herself free. She smirked, just the sheer fact that she would try to deny a goddess showed more fighting spirit than most mortals. She would indeed bear a strong, powerful child. Though, resistance cannot be tolerated. She smacks the girl firmly across the face as she growls in her ear.   ""You will do as your goddess commands. Do not question me again.""   She hissed in a stern, almost cruel tone.   Seeing the bare pussy on full display for her, she placed a hand on the girl's lower back and pushed down a bit, making her bend more. Then she took her hand and ran it along the girl's slit. Glistening juices immediately coated her finger, and as she sucked her finger clean the divine taste had her moaning in bliss.   ""You act like you don't want this, but your body tells the truth.""   She placed the tip of her cock against the hole, then pressed just enough that the head would start to spread her lips but not fully enter her.   ""Do you love your goddess?""   Artemis asked curiously with a smirk.  Caeda's nipples hardened painfully as a chain reaction to the contact of Artemis' fat cock head pressed up against her cunt. She shuddered and let the tears flow freely, the tear droplets wetting the bed as her womb began to burn. Being in the presence of a fertility goddess whom intended to breed caused her womb to eagerly ready itself to create life from the potential divine seed.   ""....please goddess.... I love my goddess... don't do this to me!""  Caeda's voice cracked as she begged. She was shaking as her wet cunt began to spread, not putting up the slightest fight against the godly cock that was going to enter her.  The goddess just watched as she saw the girl sobbing onto the bed. She smacked her ass firmly with one hand an then continued to push her hips further down. First, the cock head entered the narrow, human passage. It was a good thing her walls were so wet and had already started stretching for her. She could hardly contain herself, but she did not want this over quickly. Artemis wanted to savor every one of this girl's reactions. She wanted to take her time with this oro huntress. She started kissing her neck as she slowly slipped deeper until she met a bit of resistance and smirked.   ""Push your hips towards me and rip your virtue on my cock, or I'm going to get very rough with you.""   Artemis then smacked the girl's ass for emphasis. Her cock was already throbbing in the tight, wet canal.   ""You thought I gather women as gorgeous and powerful as yourself with no intention ofclaiming them? Don't tell me you're that naive.""  Caeda gasped out, her body trembling as she pushed up on her hands, wincing from the ass jiggling slap. She didn't want to anger her goddess, the love she held for the moon deity outweighed the fear and anger she felt about losing her virtue.   ""Y-Yes m'lady...""  Her hips shifted as she pushed up on her palms and then rocked a little bit, flinching from how painful the cock felt inside of her stretched out cunt. Taking a deep breath, she suddenly went for it, slamming her hips back fully and destroying her hymen. A loud cry escaped pass her lips and she slumped down into the bed again, blood coating the goddesses cock as proof of her virtue sacrifice to her patron.   Whilst outside of the temple, some of the huntresses avoided the suspicious cries of their sister in the temple being raped by the moon goddess.  Artemis was loving this, the loyal obedience, the unquestioning loyalty. This girl did not want to be fucked, did not want her virtue taken, but because her patron goddess had demanded it, she sacrificed her virginity to the mammoth rod of her goddess. The feeling of the fat, juicy toned ass slamming against her pelvis felt incredible, and she loved the way it jiggled from the impact. Then as the goddess leaned herself forward, a wide smile grew across Artemis' face, seeing the blood trailing down her shaft.   ""Such an obedient little slut.""   She said and smacked the girl's ass, this time far more playfully.   Then she pushed the teen's head down onto the bed, and let her hand run down the girl's back to her waist.   ""But we're not done yet.""   She grabbed Caeda's hips in both hands, pulling them back roughly and began to thrust, her balls slapping loudly, painfully against the girl's clit. She did not care that the girl screamed, she did not care if the huntresses outside grew curious. Right now, she had a fertile female to breed, one whose body was more than accommodating her every need. She slammed in faster and faster, knowing her balls would bruise the girl's clit, just like her rod would bruise her cervix. Artemis moaned as her cock began to throb.   ""Are you ready for my seed? Are you ready to bear my child?""  Artemis moaned, lowering her lips to Caeda's ear and licking the lobe lightly.   Said girl huffed into the bed, breasts swaying and jiggling with every thrust. She felt herself burning from the inside out, the goddesses girth incredibly hot and pulsating wildly in her cunt. There was truly no stopping the goddess. Not when she seemed to have a very clear mission at hand.   ""....my lady.... please....""  Caeda pleaded, gasping out haggardly as her pelvis bulged with every thrust, accommodating such a large cock. To carry a god's offspring should be the biggest honor, but she felt more terrified than anything.   From across the temple bed chambers, Artemis had a secret audience of one of the younger Huntresses. She was only ten years old, Vivian was her name. The child was wide eyed in wonder, watching the goddess make her sister huntress moan and cry into the large bed. Viv was so confused by what was going on.  The way her body felt was incredible, Artemis had begun to see why men seemed so obsessed with conquering women. In fact, she was beginning to wonder if she should just breed all her huntresses and then go out and find more. The more she slammed into this girl, the more her balls ached and her cock throbbed. She gripped the teen by the back of the head, pushing her hard into the mattress. She began slamming her hips into her with all the force she could muster.   ""You don't have to beg me to breed you, lovely. That's what I'm going to do!""   Then at last she began to cum, shooting rope after rope of a thick golden cream into the girls cunt. She did not stop thrusting, letting her juices run out of the girl and onto the bed beneath them. Then she smiled when she finally pulled out, shooting more of her spunk over Caeda's raped body.   ""You're the first to be blessed by my seed dear, but make sure you tell no one of what happened. Am I clear?""  Caeda's womb accepted the seed hungrily, causing her belly to glow softly before the light began fading as Artemis' cock pulled out of her stretched pussy. Godly seed oozed out of her gaping cunt as sobs wracked the teens sweaty body and she fisted the bedsheets in defeat. It took her a few minutes to recover before she was able to get up from the bed, bowing in respect to her goddess before hurrying out of the temple with tears in her hazel eyes. Caeda dressed quickly at the temple stairs and avoided the gaze of all the other huntresses whilst striking out to go hunt something and burn away some anger.   ""M'lady.... why was Caeda crying?""  Vivian spoke up, coming out of the shadows and playing with the hem of her dress. She really should not have been spying on them.  The goddess was pleased with her self. Despite the fact that she had just committed one of the acts that she claimed only men would do to these huntresses, the rush she felt from it was incredible. Her desire to further ruin and mate with more of her huntresses increased exponentially. She wanted to break someone. Then she heard a small, timid voice. Her eyes went wide with panic and anger. She grabbed the small child by the back of her neck.  ""YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU ARE NEVER TO ENTER MY CHAMBERS WITHOUT PERMISSION!""  Her voice rang out, filling the entire room. She backhanded the girl across the face before throwing her face down onto the bed.   ""You will speak when spoken to. This was a training exercise for Caeda, she failed. Let's see if your will is stronger.""   It was of course a lie, but the child was likely too naiive to know that. She growled as she slapped the kid firmly on her ass once, then again and again. Grabbing the panties of the young girl, she ripped them off. Then she began to spank the girl's bare ass, turning it pink.   ""Beg for my forgiveness! Beg to be spared from my wrath!""  Vivian screamed out, not one for pain tolerance like the older girls as she was spanked ruthlessly with her heavy handed goddess. The child sobbed and trembled in the bed, kicking her legs every so often to try and scoot away from the lust hungry moon goddess.   ""I'm sorry! M'lady! Sorry!""  Viv cried out, her red butt jiggling as she kicked away again but couldn't get very far. It was like a game of cat and mouse, the goddess was simply toying with her until she decided what to do with her.   ""F-Forgive me!""  She hicupped, burying her watery eyes and red face against the bed covers to try and muffle the cries that were escaping her soft lips...  The goddess, seething from rage, still spanked the child's ass while she begged until the skin was glowing red and would sting when touched. Afterwards, she laid the child flat on the bed, rolling her onto her back, knowing that her now sore ass was going to be pressed into the mattress, causing her pain. Then she ripped open the girl's dress with one hand. The petite body made a smile grow across Artemis face. Looking down at the girl's tiny bare cunt, she licked her lips.   ""I'm going to make you stronger too...""   She grabbed the girl by the throat as she began to rub her cock on the girl's slit. It was still slick with the mixture of her cum and Caeda's juices. The thought of adding Caeda's juices into this girl made her smirk.   ""You want to be a strong huntress, don't you?""  Artemis waited for the child's answer, but once she got it, she began to squeeze the girl's throat. She cut off her air supply as she got ready to shove her cock in. There would be no screaming this time. She did not want to risk someone older and less gullible walking in. Wasting no more time, she began to push her hips against the girl. Her tiny pussy seemed far too small for the huge cock. At first she was just pushing against the surface as the hole seemed to refuse to give. Then finally with enough pressure, she forced her way in. She did not stop, she completely buried herself in this girl, shredding her hymen and causing her stomach to bulge up nearly to her chest.  Sad as it was to admit, the ten year old was far to caught up in the tunnel vision consuming her vision, to fully process the blinding pain that was following as her cunt was forcefully ripped into, way more blood soaking the goddesses divine cock and acting as a decent lubricant. As her organs rearranged, most likely bruising internally, a cold chill filled the room quite suddenly. It wrapped around the pair and was followed by the scent of insence and strong masculine cologne.   ""You're proving to be a much more interesting niece than any other I've had the pleasure of watching grow into godhood.""  That voice, bone chilling and deep as it was, belonged to none other than the god of the underworld, Hades himself. Cold and strong, his hand wrapped around Artemis' slender throat, his jewelled rings digging against her luminous flesh. Hades was one of the big three, he was not a weak god in any way or form.   ""...look at you.... choking this child to the brink of death... your power precedes you Artemis.... so let me fix that...""  Hades' clothing shimmered in black smoke, baring his naked body to the temple as he forced Artemis to slam down onto the bed, lodging her cock even further up the child's ripped cunt as he mounted her from behind and unceremoniously began choking her lightly as his monstrous cock began to invade her sacred untouched cunt.   "".....take my cock like a godly whore....""  Hades hissed before slamming his hips into her, lodging his dick balls deep into her cunt. He was stretching her so much, her gold blood drenching his cock and dripping down his hairy ballsack as he began to thrust into her. Every hump causing her to push into the girl beneath them as he chose to rape the moon goddess and be the one god that ever claimed her cunt virginity.  She kissed the girl as she ravaged and raped her small, helpless form. Pushing her tongue into the girl's mouth, her power would keep the girl alive, even if she was literally killing her by choking her. The thrill of holding such a power over someone so innocent gave her a dark and sinister pleasure.   Though speaking of dark and sinister, when the voice that could only be Hades, emerged from the darkness, a chill went up her spine. Lord Hades, king of the underworld, god of the dead had arrived in her sacred grove. Her arousal from the very presence of this man caused her cock to grow longer and her cunt to drool more than it already was. When he grabbed her throat, his rings digging into her neck, she was all but his. He could have done anything in this moment and she would have begged and thanked him for it. Often, her dreams had been filled by being defiled by one of the big three, the most common of these dreams had been Hades. Despite what everyone often said about him, she knew Hades was not evil. Cruel, demanding, powerful, yes, but not evil. Death was fair, so the god of the dead was the same. The child's tears streamed down her face as she was ripped and torn beyond all belief as the power of two gods thrusting into her nearly broke her tiny frame. Even her hips had dislocated, but then were being healed by the power Artemis held over the female form. When Hades' grip slacked just enough for her to speak she whispered.   ""T-thank you, m'lord.""  Artemis' insides felt like a cold fire was burning inside of her. The savage pain of Hades cock ripping her virginity was a divine horror. It was heaven and hell, agony and ecstasy. And with each thrust, she got to break this girl some more. Finally she began to cum, filling this girl with her seed, but then glanced back at Hades.   ""Her... ass... put me.... in... her ass, please....""  Her voice begged to destroy this girl's more sinful hole.  Hades however did not care for Artemis' request, but rather cloaked the woman's dick in darkness and caused it to press through shadows, reappearing against her own butthole as if through a portal.   ""Stick it in your own ass, you filthy freak.""  He growled against her ear, slapping her butt hard and watching her own cock begin to thrust lewdly up into her unprepared ass.

""You're going to bear me a strong, beautiful line of daughters... you'll be part of my finest breeding stock now..""  Artemis breathed out heavily.  ""Aren't you?""   Her tone was full of challenge as she looked down on her seventeen year old maiden.   Caeda's hands shot out, holding tightly at Artemis' godly grip around her throat, fearing for her life in that moment until she was thrown into the deity's bed and pinned.   ""My lady no! Not my virtue!""  She reasoned, trying to push the unmoveable weight of the goddess from overtop of her naked body. Caeda had no luck in moving Artemis, so she grasped desperately for the edge of the bed, pulling herself with all of her strength until her body roughly turned and she tried to get away, feeling the godly monster of a penis slap between her firm asscheeks instead. This also gave an easier route to her hairless pussy without having to spread her legs at all.  ""Let me go! Goddess please!""  Caeda couldn't move anymore, Artemis' godly weight growing heavier with the more she resisted.  The goddess looked down as the woman begged, trying to push herself free. She smirked, just the sheer fact that she would try to deny a goddess showed more fighting spirit than most mortals. She would indeed bear a strong, powerful child. Though, resistance cannot be tolerated. She smacks the girl firmly across the face as she growls in her ear.   ""You will do as your goddess commands. Do not question me again.""   She hissed in a stern, almost cruel tone.   Seeing the bare pussy on full display for her, she placed a hand on the girl's lower back and pushed down a bit, making her bend more. Then she took her hand and ran it along the girl's slit. Glistening juices immediately coated her finger, and as she sucked her finger clean the divine taste had her moaning in bliss.   ""You act like you don't want this, but your body tells the truth.""   She placed the tip of her cock against the hole, then pressed just enough that the head would start to spread her lips but not fully enter her.   ""Do you love your goddess?""   Artemis asked curiously with a smirk.  Caeda's nipples hardened painfully as a chain reaction to the contact of Artemis' fat cock head pressed up against her cunt. She shuddered and let the tears flow freely, the tear droplets wetting the bed as her womb began to burn. Being in the presence of a fertility goddess whom intended to breed caused her womb to eagerly ready itself to create life from the potential divine seed.   ""....please goddess.... I love my goddess... don't do this to me!""  Caeda's voice cracked as she begged. She was shaking as her wet cunt began to spread, not putting up the slightest fight against the godly cock that was going to enter her.  The goddess just watched as she saw the girl sobbing onto the bed. She smacked her ass firmly with one hand an then continued to push her hips further down. First, the cock head entered the narrow, human passage. It was a good thing her walls were so wet and had already started stretching for her. She could hardly contain herself, but she did not want this over quickly. Artemis wanted to savor every one of this girl's reactions. She wanted to take her time with this oro huntress. She started kissing her neck as she slowly slipped deeper until she met a bit of resistance and smirked.   ""Push your hips towards me and rip your virtue on my cock, or I'm going to get very rough with you.""   Artemis then smacked the girl's ass for emphasis. Her cock was already throbbing in the tight, wet canal.   ""You thought I gather women as gorgeous and powerful as yourself with no intention ofclaiming them? Don't tell me you're that naive.""  Caeda gasped out, her body trembling as she pushed up on her hands, wincing from the ass jiggling slap. She didn't want to anger her goddess, the love she held for the moon deity outweighed the fear and anger she felt about losing her virtue.   ""Y-Yes m'lady...""  Her hips shifted as she pushed up on her palms and then rocked a little bit, flinching from how painful the cock felt inside of her stretched out cunt. Taking a deep breath, she suddenly went for it, slamming her hips back fully and destroying her hymen. A loud cry escaped pass her lips and she slumped down into the bed again, blood coating the goddesses cock as proof of her virtue sacrifice to her patron.   Whilst outside of the temple, some of the huntresses avoided the suspicious cries of their sister in the temple being raped by the moon goddess.  Artemis was loving this, the loyal obedience, the unquestioning loyalty. This girl did not want to be fucked, did not want her virtue taken, but because her patron goddess had demanded it, she sacrificed her virginity to the mammoth rod of her goddess. The feeling of the fat, juicy toned ass slamming against her pelvis felt incredible, and she loved the way it jiggled from the impact. Then as the goddess leaned herself forward, a wide smile grew across Artemis' face, seeing the blood trailing down her shaft.   ""Such an obedient little slut.""   She said and smacked the girl's ass, this time far more playfully.   Then she pushed the teen's head down onto the bed, and let her hand run down the girl's back to her waist.   ""But we're not done yet.""   She grabbed Caeda's hips in both hands, pulling them back roughly and began to thrust, her balls slapping loudly, painfully against the girl's clit. She did not care that the girl screamed, she did not care if the huntresses outside grew curious. Right now, she had a fertile female to breed, one whose body was more than accommodating her every need. She slammed in faster and faster, knowing her balls would bruise the girl's clit, just like her rod would bruise her cervix. Artemis moaned as her cock began to throb.   ""Are you ready for my seed? Are you ready to bear my child?""  Artemis moaned, lowering her lips to Caeda's ear and licking the lobe lightly.   Said girl huffed into the bed, breasts swaying and jiggling with every thrust. She felt herself burning from the inside out, the goddesses girth incredibly hot and pulsating wildly in her cunt. There was truly no stopping the goddess. Not when she seemed to have a very clear mission at hand.   ""....my lady.... please....""  Caeda pleaded, gasping out haggardly as her pelvis bulged with every thrust, accommodating such a large cock. To carry a god's offspring should be the biggest honor, but she felt more terrified than anything.   From across the temple bed chambers, Artemis had a secret audience of one of the younger Huntresses. She was only ten years old, Vivian was her name. The child was wide eyed in wonder, watching the goddess make her sister huntress moan and cry into the large bed. Viv was so confused by what was going on.  The way her body felt was incredible, Artemis had begun to see why men seemed so obsessed with conquering women. In fact, she was beginning to wonder if she should just breed all her huntresses and then go out and find more. The more she slammed into this girl, the more her balls ached and her cock throbbed. She gripped the teen by the back of the head, pushing her hard into the mattress. She began slamming her hips into her with all the force she could muster.   ""You don't have to beg me to breed you, lovely. That's what I'm going to do!""   Then at last she began to cum, shooting rope after rope of a thick golden cream into the girls cunt. She did not stop thrusting, letting her juices run out of the girl and onto the bed beneath them. Then she smiled when she finally pulled out, shooting more of her spunk over Caeda's raped body.   ""You're the first to be blessed by my seed dear, but make sure you tell no one of what happened. Am I clear?""  Caeda's womb accepted the seed hungrily, causing her belly to glow softly before the light began fading as Artemis' cock pulled out of her stretched pussy. Godly seed oozed out of her gaping cunt as sobs wracked the teens sweaty body and she fisted the bedsheets in defeat. It took her a few minutes to recover before she was able to get up from the bed, bowing in respect to her goddess before hurrying out of the temple with tears in her hazel eyes. Caeda dressed quickly at the temple stairs and avoided the gaze of all the other huntresses whilst striking out to go hunt something and burn away some anger.   ""M'lady.... why was Caeda crying?""  Vivian spoke up, coming out of the shadows and playing with the hem of her dress. She really should not have been spying on them.  The goddess was pleased with her self. Despite the fact that she had just committed one of the acts that she claimed only men would do to these huntresses, the rush she felt from it was incredible. Her desire to further ruin and mate with more of her huntresses increased exponentially. She wanted to break someone. Then she heard a small, timid voice. Her eyes went wide with panic and anger. She grabbed the small child by the back of her neck.  ""YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU ARE NEVER TO ENTER MY CHAMBERS WITHOUT PERMISSION!""  Her voice rang out, filling the entire room. She backhanded the girl across the face before throwing her face down onto the bed.   ""You will speak when spoken to. This was a training exercise for Caeda, she failed. Let's see if your will is stronger.""   It was of course a lie, but the child was likely too naiive to know that. She growled as she slapped the kid firmly on her ass once, then again and again. Grabbing the panties of the young girl, she ripped them off. Then she began to spank the girl's bare ass, turning it pink.   ""Beg for my forgiveness! Beg to be spared from my wrath!""  Vivian screamed out, not one for pain tolerance like the older girls as she was spanked ruthlessly with her heavy handed goddess. The child sobbed and trembled in the bed, kicking her legs every so often to try and scoot away from the lust hungry moon goddess.   ""I'm sorry! M'lady! Sorry!""  Viv cried out, her red butt jiggling as she kicked away again but couldn't get very far. It was like a game of cat and mouse, the goddess was simply toying with her until she decided what to do with her.   ""F-Forgive me!""  She hicupped, burying her watery eyes and red face against the bed covers to try and muffle the cries that were escaping her soft lips...  The goddess, seething from rage, still spanked the child's ass while she begged until the skin was glowing red and would sting when touched. Afterwards, she laid the child flat on the bed, rolling her onto her back, knowing that her now sore ass was going to be pressed into the mattress, causing her pain. Then she ripped open the girl's dress with one hand. The petite body made a smile grow across Artemis face. Looking down at the girl's tiny bare cunt, she licked her lips.   ""I'm going to make you stronger too...""   She grabbed the girl by the throat as she began to rub her cock on the girl's slit. It was still slick with the mixture of her cum and Caeda's juices. The thought of adding Caeda's juices into this girl made her smirk.   ""You want to be a strong huntress, don't you?""  Artemis waited for the child's answer, but once she got it, she began to squeeze the girl's throat. She cut off her air supply as she got ready to shove her cock in. There would be no screaming this time. She did not want to risk someone older and less gullible walking in. Wasting no more time, she began to push her hips against the girl. Her tiny pussy seemed far too small for the huge cock. At first she was just pushing against the surface as the hole seemed to refuse to give. Then finally with enough pressure, she forced her way in. She did not stop, she completely buried herself in this girl, shredding her hymen and causing her stomach to bulge up nearly to her chest.  Sad as it was to admit, the ten year old was far to caught up in the tunnel vision consuming her vision, to fully process the blinding pain that was following as her cunt was forcefully ripped into, way more blood soaking the goddesses divine cock and acting as a decent lubricant. As her organs rearranged, most likely bruising internally, a cold chill filled the room quite suddenly. It wrapped around the pair and was followed by the scent of insence and strong masculine cologne.   ""You're proving to be a much more interesting niece than any other I've had the pleasure of watching grow into godhood.""  That voice, bone chilling and deep as it was, belonged to none other than the god of the underworld, Hades himself. Cold and strong, his hand wrapped around Artemis' slender throat, his jewelled rings digging against her luminous flesh. Hades was one of the big three, he was not a weak god in any way or form.   ""...look at you.... choking this child to the brink of death... your power precedes you Artemis.... so let me fix that...""  Hades' clothing shimmered in black smoke, baring his naked body to the temple as he forced Artemis to slam down onto the bed, lodging her cock even further up the child's ripped cunt as he mounted her from behind and unceremoniously began choking her lightly as his monstrous cock began to invade her sacred untouched cunt.   "".....take my cock like a godly whore....""  Hades hissed before slamming his hips into her, lodging his dick balls deep into her cunt. He was stretching her so much, her gold blood drenching his cock and dripping down his hairy ballsack as he began to thrust into her. Every hump causing her to push into the girl beneath them as he chose to rape the moon goddess and be the one god that ever claimed her cunt virginity.  She kissed the girl as she ravaged and raped her small, helpless form. Pushing her tongue into the girl's mouth, her power would keep the girl alive, even if she was literally killing her by choking her. The thrill of holding such a power over someone so innocent gave her a dark and sinister pleasure.   Though speaking of dark and sinister, when the voice that could only be Hades, emerged from the darkness, a chill went up her spine. Lord Hades, king of the underworld, god of the dead had arrived in her sacred grove. Her arousal from the very presence of this man caused her cock to grow longer and her cunt to drool more than it already was. When he grabbed her throat, his rings digging into her neck, she was all but his. He could have done anything in this moment and she would have begged and thanked him for it. Often, her dreams had been filled by being defiled by one of the big three, the most common of these dreams had been Hades. Despite what everyone often said about him, she knew Hades was not evil. Cruel, demanding, powerful, yes, but not evil. Death was fair, so the god of the dead was the same. The child's tears streamed down her face as she was ripped and torn beyond all belief as the power of two gods thrusting into her nearly broke her tiny frame. Even her hips had dislocated, but then were being healed by the power Artemis held over the female form. When Hades' grip slacked just enough for her to speak she whispered.   ""T-thank you, m'lord.""  Artemis' insides felt like a cold fire was burning inside of her. The savage pain of Hades cock ripping her virginity was a divine horror. It was heaven and hell, agony and ecstasy. And with each thrust, she got to break this girl some more. Finally she began to cum, filling this girl with her seed, but then glanced back at Hades.   ""Her... ass... put me.... in... her ass, please....""  Her voice begged to destroy this girl's more sinful hole.  Hades however did not care for Artemis' request, but rather cloaked the woman's dick in darkness and caused it to press through shadows, reappearing against her own butthole as if through a portal.   ""Stick it in your own ass, you filthy freak.""  He growled against her ear, slapping her butt hard and watching her own cock begin to thrust lewdly up into her unprepared ass. He shuddered at the power he held over her, grabbing her hips and pulling her back roughly against his cock rapidly. His eyes closed as he focused on his own pleasure, using her body for his own whims. The same way she had done the small trembling girl beneath her. Whatever her name was, Hades took pity on her, combining his healing with hers and healing the girl until it left her in a dreamless sleep on the same bed they were fucking on like animals.  Being fucked by Hades was everything she could ever want and more. He was cold and degrading. Feeling the shadows move her cock, she did not know what else to say or do. She simply obeyed. She shoved her hips forward, and as they did, her cock rammed into her own unused, unlubed ass. The only slight relief was the blood and cum that was already on her shaft. She violated herself, the thick cock stretching her hole to the point of ripping. The power of Hades' thrusts forcing her to her knees and elbows. Then Artemis began to feel a tugging on her nipple, followd by fluid rushing out of it. Her eyes went wider.  ""Th-this is... not... allowed.... she's... drinking my... milk.""   It was one of the rules that she had made, even though she was a goddess of fertility and an eternal virgin, her body always produced milk and she had forbidden humans from ever tasting it.   ""I... must... be better... than.... that whore... Persephone...""  Hades seemed unamused by the young girl that was latched on to Artemis' breast, suckling her milk desperately. He lifted a hand, redressing her in the guise of shadows and returning her to the warmth of her own bed somewhere in the huntress camp down below. He then summoned Cerberus in his puppy form, smirking down at Artemis' as the three headed puppy sniffed around her boobs and two out of the three heads latched on to a nipple each, suckling more ravenously than the human child had been. They weren't even gentle about their claws either, pawing against her large milk sagging breasts and hungrily drinking her milk like they were starving.   ""Who knew, you'd be a useful cow yet.""  Hades mocked, encircling Artemis' flat and toned belly with his cold hands. A devious smile filtered across his lips as he thrusted into her a few more times and then began to cum, seeding her womb with his potent load, caressing her belly as it began to swell and swell until life could definitely be felt inside. Godly pregnancies were instantaneous, which was why he seemed so smug as he pulled out of her, watching his cum dribble out of her ruined cunt.  ""I hope childbirth is especially agonizing for you... maybe Hera will make sure to it..""  Hades smirked, dissolving into shadows along with Cerberus, back to the pits of the underworld he had come from. The shadows around her cock disappeared, making her erection swing between her thighs, going immediately limp...";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
47019253;;;;;Thetis;;;;;;Zeus/Fate;;;;;;forced marriage;;;;;"Heracles unbinds Prometheus and talks with him.  I had a dream. I was removed from the crag and was lying on the ground in a curled position, feeling some pleasant warmth on my face and stomach. But a part of me was still awake and conscious, and knew it was just a dream. Maybe the warmth was real, from the sun, though if so, it was unusually strong for such an early spring. But the changed position was an illusion, and I knew that if I tried to move my body or any limb, the chains would cut into my wounds and would add new sharp pain to the background pain that was always with me. Strangely, the background pain had changed its pattern. It had subsided where I felt it in recent times, and instead had reappeared in my hand and feet that had become numb decades ago.  Then I smelled smoke, smoke of raw wood. This made me open my eyes. I saw that I was indeed lying on the ground on my left side, and a fire of juniper branches was burning - and smoking - in front of me. More junipers were growing around. What a strange hallucination! I looked at my body. It was covered by a blanket. My arms were curled rather than stretched, and the chains were attached to the wrists but their other ends were lying on the ground. Nothing made any sense, yet it looked and felt increasingly real. It seemed I was truly free after all, though it defied explanation.  And then someone came, carrying more juniper branches. Heracles! I finally understood. He had returned and rescued me. And because there was no one else in sight, he had most likely done it of his own accord, notwithstanding the will of Zeus.  He left his load on the ground and added two of the branches to the fire. I called his name and he turned to me.  'You are awake, hurrah!' he rejoiced. 'I feared you could never wake up.'  'You took me down from the crag?'  'Exactly. I hid and waited until Hermes cleared the terrain, then climbed back and finished the job.' He added with pride, 'I hate doing things halfway.'  'Immense thanks but... You shouldn't have done it. You took too great a risk.'  'Come what may. Nobody needs me anymore, and nobody will weep for me anyway.' After a moment, he corrected himself: 'Only my old mother.'  Then I realized something that hit me like a heavy object.  'Heracles!' I appealed. 'You must return to the crag and bring a piece of it, now! Because Zeus has sworn to keep me chained to it. If he breaks his oath, he will suffer terribly, and will punish you terribly.'  'So we need a piece of that crag here next to you, to pretend you are still on it?'  'Yes!'  'Relax, then! We have it.' Heracles poked into his backpack and brough out a piece of rock. From this angle, it vaguely resembled the hand axes of the Ants. 'I took it because it brought me luck.'  'It really did,' I agreed with a sigh of relief.  'I first tried to pull the chains out of the rock but they didn't even shake. Then I took a hammer that I had brought for this purpose, and tried to break them. But the hammer slipped out of my hand and fell down into the precipice. It was impossible to retrieve it, so I broke this piece from the rock to use it instead. Only then did I see that in each chain, one link was yellowish. I hit on these links, and each of them shattered after the first stroke. But I was afraid when you didn't even wake up. I feared that I'd come too late.'  'So you brought me to - where are we?'  'Somewhere in the mountain, that's all I can say. I walked down the path I came for about three hours, to reach the juniper shrubbery so I could kindle a fire and build a shelter for the night.'  Relaxed, I looked at the snow covering the ground outside the warm circle around the fire.  'Could you please melt a little snow?' I asked. 'Or just put some into my mouth? I'm thirsty.'  'You drink water?' Heracles was surprised. 'I thought you drink only nectar, and eat ambrosia.'  'We eat and drink like you. That's why I divided the ox.'  He brought to my mouth a small pot full of water which tasted like melted snow. After I drank, he said:  'Do you want to eat? I have bread.'  'Yes, please!'  'I also have olives but I am not sure you should eat them. They are a heavy food.'  'You are right but may I see them? I've never seen olives. They appeared after I was bound here.'  'Here they are. Look, these ones are still on twigs with leaves. And here is the bread.' Heracles brought out a piece, broke it into morsels and put one into my mouth. He said:  'I see that you've had nothing to eat and drink for a long time.'  'The Erinyes came and brought me food and water but it was never enough.'  'The Erinyes? It's good that they fed you but... they aren't a good company, are they?'  'No, they aren't.'  'They come also to me when I unintentionally kill someone... to torment me. But I tell them, if they can return the dead to life, they are welcome, if not, to go away.'  He fed me a little more bread. Its taste awakened old memories and I shared them:  'We sowed barley with my human friends once but then the flood destroyed it. How have you obtained it after the flood?'  'Demeter gave it to Triptolemus of Eleusis.'  'I am glad that other gods also help the humans now. Back then, nobody approved my deed. Many begged Zeus to relent and punish me less severely. But nobody disputed that I deserved a punishment because I had bestowed honors upon mortal creatures beyond their due. Such were the times... Even the gods barely remember them, and for the humans, it must be forgotten prehistory. But for me, it was like yesterday, because then I was bound here, and my real life was over...'  I stopped talking, ashamed of complaining so much. Heracles said:  'I cut off your hair and beard, for they were hopeless. I saw a wound on the back of your head but it's not deep - apparently not from the bird's beak.'  'I banged my head into the rock,' I admitted.  'You tried to kill yourself?'  'No, just couldn't help doing it when the bird...'  'Well, it's over. Do you think they will check on you and find out that you are gone?'  I considered the question and the more I thought of it, the less likely it seemed that Zeus would really let me alone in eternal sleep.  'I think they will,' I said. 'I think that Zeus will be unhappy that Hermes has botched the negotiations, and will try again. Let's think what you'll say when they return.'  'Well, the way they were treating you, immortality or not, you would very soon be unable to negotiate, so they should be thankful to me. And with this fire, it's not like we are hiding. But I think you must say that damned secret.'  'I don't know,' I admitted.  'Why? Are you worrying about Chiron? Believe me, he suffers unbearably and longs for death. He would have already stopped eating ambrosia but he still has some pupils and wants to complete teaching them.'  'I don't want to uphold Zeus' power... after all he did, and all he can do.'  'What exactly can he do?'  'I wish I knew!'  'You talked about me as if you knew everything that has happened and will happen. But now you say that you don't know what Zeus intends.'  'I know some things from the past and future but not all. In fact, very little. Tell me about yourself!'  'I was born in Thebes, the city with the seven-gated fortress...'  'What is a city?' I asked, leaving ""fortress"" aside. I was sure that these were not words that I had forgotten but rather words I had never known.  'A large settlement. How was it called back in your time?'  'At my time, there were no such things. Sorry that I interrupted you.'  'I had to become king of Mycenae but Hera made my aunt give birth prematurely, so my cousin Eurystheus was born before me and became king...'  'I think she did you a favor. Being a king is dirty work.'  'But it was my birthright! And she has harmed me more. When I was eight months old, she put two large snakes into my cradle to strangulate me, but I killed them instead. I am very strong. But I cannot control myself, and I don't think very well. As I told you, I never learned reading and writing. As a boy, I had a tutor for some time. But I got angry at him, unwittingly hit him on the head too hard and killed him. Then no one wanted to teach me. When I grew up, I did a favor to Creon the ruler of Thebes, and he gave me his daughter Megara to be my wife. She bore me three wonderful sons. And then great misfortune struck me...'  Heracles made a pause and swallowed several times before continuing:  'Because Hera with her intrigues had made my cousin Eurystheus king, I had to serve him. But he is a good-for-nothing scoundrel. You cannot imagine how I felt!'  I could imagine it very well but said nothing because I didn't want to interrupt him again.  'He hadn't sought me for years and I hoped that he didn't need me anymore and would leave me alone. But I was wrong. Exactly when I had finally managed my own life and was happy, he sent me a message to report to him so that he would give me tasks. Then madness overwhelmed me... It seemed to me that my eldest nephew Iolaus was Eurystheus, and his two younger brothers... and my own children... were his sons. And I rushed to kill them... Iolaus escaped but I killed the five children... Have you any loved ones - a wife, relatives?'  'I had. I had a wife, three brothers, parents. I had also a son and a daughter but they were mortal, and died long ago.'  'But the others aren't mortal, are they? Why do you talk as if they are also dead?'  'Hermes said that they have written me off. But I am not sure now that this is entirely true. I know it's true about my eldest brother Atlas. Maybe about my youngest brother as well. But I wonder why Hermes and the Erinyes didn't tell me earlier. They are always happy to bring me bad tidings.'  'So Hermes told you that your loved ones no longer love you, and you decided to sleep. I felt the same when I came back to my senses. Do you remember what Hermes said - that mad people should not live? I also thought that it's better for those like me to die. I intended to kill myself but my friend Theseus stopped me. He told me that Hera has most likely afflicted me with madness...'  'Yes, she has, and also Zeus before her.'  'My father? But why?'  'I mean you have inherited dangerous things from him. Look at me - would he do such things if he were sane? And some of his sons skin or tear apart alive people they don't like. Good that Theseus happened to be there. What happened then?'  'I consulted the Oracle of Delphi. The priestess told me to go to Eurystheus and offer him my services, and he'd order me to perform ten Labors to atone for my deed. Since then, I've been busy with these tasks. I have in fact already performed ten Labors but he dismissed two of them. He had sent me to kill a monster called Hydra. It was lurking near the city of Lerna and eating the travelers. It had nine heads, eight mortal and one immortal in the middle. I started removing them but as soon as I chopped one off, two new ones grew in its place. I called Iolaus to help me and while I was cutting the heads, he burned their places so that they wouldn't grow anymore. So we killed the Lernaean Hydra, except its immortal head which we couldn't kill and I buried it deep under a crag. But when I returned, Eurystheus said that he wouldn't count this Labor because Iolaus had helped me. The other one he didn't count was the cleaning up of king Augeas' stables because I had received payment for it. That's why I still have two Labors left: the one in Hesperia and the one that you say will be in Hades, and they will be twelve totally. After I killed the Hydra, I immersed my arrows in its poisonous bloud. Since then, everybody pierced by these arrows dies in extreme pain. This is how I unfortunately injured my friend Chiron. I was aiming at another centaur but hit him. He has suffered ever since but as long as he eats ambrosia, he will not die.'  'Let me repeat: in such an accident, immediately immerse the injured body part in hot water. Remember this!' I said. I had a foreboding that such an accident would happen to Heracles himself.  'Between the Labors, I do some other things,' he continued. 'Upon returning from the tenth Labor, I was invited to an expedition to Colchis to seek a golden fleece. We were fifty, and sailed on a ship named Argo. We crossed the Euxine.' Heracles said ""Euxine"" quite clearly and confidently, so I realized that the name of the sea had changed. 'When we were already close to Colchis, we disembarked on the shore. One of us got lost, and we made a search party but never found him. His name was Hylas, and he was a very good friend of mine. I suppose that the poor one has fallen and died somewhere in the wilderness.'  'The water nymphs have liked him and lured him,' I chimed in. I preferred not to reveal that they had unintentionally drowned him.  'I hope he is well,' replied Heracles, apparently doubting it. 'After searching long in vain, I despaired. At that moment, Iris appeared to me. It was like a dream but was no dream. She smiled and was very polite. She told me to give up everything else and go rescue you from the eagle. So I left my companions and came here. I wandered for a long time, for the Caucasus is a wilderness without tracks. I wished I had a flying device like that which Daedalus built to escape from Crete. Though maybe it was better that I hadn't, because his son Icarus fell and died. It was exactly me who found and buried the body, and it was horrible to behold...'  I was stunned. I supposed that the flying device constructed by Daedalus had been engineless but it was still hard to believe that the humans who hadn't yet mastered the iron were already trying to travel by air.  'When I would lose myself totally, someone left signs for me,' said Heracles. 'Nevertheless, I already feared that I wouldn't find you and would just wander until I'd run out of food and die. However, two days ago at dawn, I heard someone cry - was this you?'  'Yes, it was me. I tried to endure in silence but couldn't.'  'And it was good that you couldn't, because I heard you and finally found you. I'd shoot that disgusting bird even if they hadn't told me. I wouldn't stand by and watch it eat you alive. Then I considered my job done, and intended to leave. But as I turned my back, I realized that Hermes had not actually promised me that they'd set you free from your bonds, and I was afraid for you. So I hid and then returned to rescue you. Now, I have my peace of mind, and this is most important. Besides, as I said, I have no children to support anymore. I have only Megara. She forgave me but I have the feeling that she'd be happier without me. She is now living in Tiryns, where my mother is from, and I visit her whenever I can. We had to leave Thebes, of course.'  I had a feeling now that Heracles would get away with releasing me, and I voiced it:  'Methinks you have nothing to be afraid of now. And generally you can cope with almost any difficulty coming from without. The real perils for you are the fits of rage and madness coming from within. They cost the life of whoever happens to be around, guilty or not. Why did you want to kill Eurystheus' children? You must learn to control yourself. Count to fifty before raising your hand against someone!'  As I expected, Heracles didn't like my words. Rage distorted his face, and he raised his right hand as if to hit me.  'This is exactly what I mean,' I added. Heracles slowly pulled his hand down.  'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I can't control myself. This is the curse of my life.'  'It's all right, but be careful not to kill anymore. And as I already said, part ways with Megara! She has forgiven you but you mustn't live together anymore. No marriage can survive what happened.'  'But how can I leave her alone and without protection?'  'Don't leave her alone, give her as wife to someone trustworthy! I think Iolaus is the best. He is good-hearted, and they'll love each other.'     Heracles added juniper branches into the fire and asked:  'Now, if you aren't too exhausted, would you tell me your story? Why did you and my father become enemies? How did you decide to give us fire? And is it true that you have created the humans?'  I remained silent for a moment to collect my thoughts, wondering where to begin. Then I began my tale at random:  'This was the third human generation. Athena, Hephaestus and I created it, following your father's order. Otherwise, none of us would think of it, let alone dare do it. Zeus was far-sighted. He had figured out that sentient mortal beings, similar to us, were needed. But when we created them, he didn't like them. He wanted to bring the whole race to an end and create a new one in its place, more to his liking. I disagreed. You asked why we became enemies. After all, I supported him in his revolt against Cronus. I stood against most of my family...'  'You mean the War of the Titans?'  'Yes.'  'I have wondered why after it, Zeus imprisoned the other titans but left you free. Why did you side with him?'  'Because of stupidity. I was young and thought that if we topple to old tyrant, everything would be fine. However, once enthroned, Zeus started doing things I found wrong. I objected, and we started to dislike each other. But we truly quarreled over the humans. I befriended some of them. And my son would be like them. But they had nothing, and Zeus wanted them never to have anything. You talk about cities, ships and flying devices. The humans of my time had only dreams of food, warmth and shelter. We met with their chiefs at a place named Mecone - do you know it?'  'In Peloponnese, close to the isthmus?' asked Heracles.  'Yes, it was close to the isthmus,' I confirmed, though I had never before heard the name Peloponnese.  'I have heard that this is the old name of the place where today is the city of Sicyon.'  'At Mecone, Zeus ordered me to show how to do a sacrifice. I made a trick so that the meat remained for the humans, and the gods ended up with the bones. We actually had our own flocks and didn't need the human ones. However, your father got quite angry, and forbade us to give fire to the humans. I gave them whatever else I could but without fire, nothing was of much use. The winter was disastrous for them, their children were dying of cold. And when Zeus forbade me to meet them anymore, I went for one last time and showed them how to kindle fire by friction...'  'Really? Our tradition says that you have stolen a firebrand from Zeus' hearth, or from Hephaestus' forge, or from Helios' chariot.'  'Nonsense! I had my own hearth but why carry around firebrands so that everyone would see me? And I had to learn the humans to kindle fire themselves anyway. Your father considered the fire his property, like everything else. That's why he said I had stolen it. However, I thought that the fire belongs to everyone. And I still think so.'  'Some say that my father actually wanted you to give us fire.'  'They may well be right. But his intention wasn't good. I think he set a trap for me, and I stepped into it and dragged the humans as well. Your father was seeking an excuse to deal with them and with me, and I gave him one. At my trial, he said: ""Son of Iapetus, surpassing all in cunning, you are glad that you have outwitted me and stolen fire - a great plague to you yourself and to men that shall be. But I will give men as the price for fire an evil thing, their own destruction."" And he laughed. Yes, he laughed. I had foreseen my fate but too late did I see what he'd do to the humans. Do you know what happened then? Have you heard of Pandora and her... box?' I couldn't remember the word ""jar"".  'I know nothing about the box but have heard of Pandora. That she was the first mortal woman, sent to the human race as a punishment. Was it truly so? It makes Megara angry that just because Pandora was bad, all women are blamed.'  'She wasn't bad, just curious. And she wasn't the first mortal woman. Zeus decided to use my feeble-minded brother Epimetheus to hurt the humans. He made the Olympians adorn Pandora, placed a jar full of contagious diseases into her hands, and sent her to become my brother's wife. I had warned him to accept nothing from Zeus, but he had no sense. So women are blamed just because I happened to have a feeble-minded brother rather than a sister.'  'But people also say that Pandora gave us hope,' remarked Heracles.  'It's true. She gave birth to Pyrrha, and I don't think Deucalion would have coped without Pyrrha. But before hope, Pandora gave diseases - because she opened the box, of course. So outbreaks afflicted the humans, and their numbers plummeted. But some withstood the diseases. Zeus saw that he wouldn't get rid of mankind so easily, and made a flood. This was thirty years after the so-called theft of fire...'  'I have heard that he ordered the flood because humans succumbed to evil.'  'They say so to whitewash Zeus. In fact, he had decided to destroy the humans, be they good and bad. But it's true that after Pandora's box, many were ruined inside and resorted to evil. They would blame some unfortunate man for bringing disease, and kill him on the spot. But the worst thing was that they stopped worshipping the gods. As a result, most gods agreed with Zeus that this generation of humans had to be wiped out from the face of the Earth and be replaced with another, allegedly better. A crazy chief named Lycaon tipped the balance. He sacrificed a boy to Zeus, thinking - with some logic - that Olympians wanted human sacrifices. Your father used this as an excuse to flood the lands populated by humans. Only my son Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha survived. I had warned them about the flood, and they built a chest. They were offspring of gods, so Zeus didn't dare to kill them...'  'You mean Deucalion who survived the flood, wanted new humans and became ruler of Thessaly! I have heard of him of course but I didn't know he was your son.'  'My descendants leave out this awkward detail,' I admitted. 'They prefer to point out that they derive from Zeus, which is also true because he raped Pyrrha and her daughters and begat children with them. Anyway, mankind had a new start, and most diseases brought by Pandora disappeared with the flood - at least for the time being. But back then, I couldn't find anything positive. I regretted my deeds, because however wretched the life of humans in the Stone Age was, my intervention brought their demise.'  'Did you tell anyone of your regret?'  'No, I didn't.' Heracles smiled, satisfied. 'You are the first to hear about it. But I said a lot of other things. Most importantly, I uttered the prophecy that a particular woman, if raped by Zeus, would give birth to a son stronger than him. But I haven't said her name to this day, and I don't intend to.'  'I think that you must.'  'Heracles, your father killed off my friends, tortured me until I turned into a shadow of my former self, and made the pettiest revenge possible by raping my daughter in-law and my granddaughters! And you say I must give him what he wants?'  'About the latter, I don't even think it was revenge,' said Heracles. 'It seems that my father rapes anything that moves. No one of my family has ever rebelled against him, yet he forced himself on my mother Alcmene, and this is how I was conceived. People say that he is very good, but I am a living proof that he isn't, for if he was, I wouldn't exist at all! Unless we say that whatever he does is good, but this makes no sense.'  'Excellent argument!' I admitted. 'But please don't say it to others.'  'I won't.'  'And don't pursue one woman after another like him. He can do whatever he wants because he makes others pay for his mistakes. But if you do the same, you'll suffer terribly, and will die early. So let me repeat, it's the best for you not to marry again, but if you really need a woman, choose one and be loyal to her.'  'I'd wish to do so, but as I said, I cannot control myself. I take after my father in this. So I'll follow my fate. I am doomed to die anyway. I am not immortal, no matter how much I wish to be. I have heard that my father has grabbed some boy from Phrygia, made him his cupbearer and given him immortality, but he has no intention to bestow the same gift on me, his own son.'  I had a reasonable guess that the Phrygian boy was wanted for services other than cupbearing, which Heracles couldn't perform exactly because he was Zeus' son. I didn't voice it, just asked:  'Do you wish to be immortal?'  'Of course I do! I know it's impossible but I still wish it. And though I suffered greatly after I killed my sons and nephews, I am glad that Theseus didn't let me die. I can challenge death, and I have done it many times, but I still think nothing is worse than it!'  I just nodded, though I knew that worse than death was wishing for it in vain. Heracles returned to the previous subject:  'And I fear that if you don't reveal the secret, this would mean death for many of us. Because, when the stronger son comes, the first thing he'll do will be a big war in our lands. And then, if any humans have remained, he may wish to clear them. My father for all his faults has already put up with the existence of humans.'  'You are right here,' I admitted, 'though Zeus still kindles stupid wars among humans.'  'It seems that his power has diminished,' coucluded Heracles and asked a surprising question: 'Do you know if he's still Thunderer?'  'What makes you doubt it?'  'I have a friend named Admetus, he rules over Pherae. Do you know what happened to him?'  'No, I don't, please tell me!'  'Admetus had as a servant Apollo himself for an entire year! But let me begin from the beginning. Some time ago, Apollo fell in love with a mortal woman named Coronis, and begat a child. But she cheated on him because she didn't love him, she loved a man. Apollo found out and shot her, or sent Artemis to shoot her - I am not sure what exactly happened. Anyway, Coronis was killed, together with many poor people who just happened to be nearby...'  'Typical.'  'And she was about to give birth. Apollo cut her womb open and brought out his son alive. He named him Asclepius and gave him to Chiron for upbringing. Apollo hoped that his son would befriend gods and be given immortality. Instead, Asclepius wished to help humans. He became a great healer, some say better than his father. He cured many who were considered doomed. But once he brought back to life a man hit by Zeus' thunderbolt, and my father got angry. He killed the man again, and then killed Asclepius with another thunderbolt. Apollo was enraged, and avenged his son by shooting the Cyclopes who had forged the thunderbolt. Zeus relented and revived Asclepius but ordered Apollo to become a mortal's servant for a year as a punishment. This is why he had to serve Admetus. When I heard of this, I thought that with the Cyclopes dead, there would be no more thunderbolts. However, they didn't even diminish.'  What news! It was good that I was lying, for I felt my world turning upside down. And Heracles was relating it quite an everyday manner - apparently his imagination wasn't too lively. I could now understand why my mention of Leto had enraged Hermes so much.  'The thunderbolt was both a weapon and a natural phenomenon,' I explained. 'The natural phenomenon will remain. However, only the Cyclopes knew how to make the weapon, so it will come to an end. However, don't tell the humans about it! They will grow overconfident, and Zeus may still be Thunderer for some time because he is likely to have dozens of stored thunderbolts. Moreover, he has other weapons as well.'  'But he is going to lose this particular weapon sooner or later, isn't he?'  'If the Cyclopes are truly dead, then yes, he is.'  'Then I suppose that, knowing that he won't be as dangerous anymore, you can accept his power and have your life back.'  'Not much has remained of it...'  'Whatever has remained. So tell that damn secret! You'll do a favor to yourself and everyone else. Including the lady. Whoever she is, I don't think she'd want my father in her bed. My mother didn't.'  'Yes, she definitely wouldn't want him.'  'So reveal it! Just take care that my father doesn't deceive you. Don't rely on his mercy!'  'Of course I won't. I know Zeus' mercy. Its key quality is its absence.'  I felt that Hermes would return any moment, and told Heracles about it:  'Please add green branches to the fire to produce smoke. Hermes will soon come, and will wonder where I am.'  'I wish I hadn't to deliver you to my father, and return to serve that wretch Eurystheus.'  'Once I am out of here, I'll be safe. And you do a good job ridding the forests and the see from monsters, the result of irresponsible experiments. Try to look at Eurystheus' funny side. I can see him trembling behind the walls of Mycenae, daring not show his nose...'  'Whenever I bring him something truly interesting, he hides in a large jar.'  'I wish to see him when you bring him Cerberus! Now call Hermes, for he is already circling above the crag and wondering.'  Hermes returns and negotiates with Prometheus.  Heracles stood up, waived his hands over his head and cried out:  'Here, here! We are here!' The knife with which he had cut the juniper shone in his right hand. He turned to Prometheus and said in a low voice: 'What a fool I must look like, pointing a knife at the sky!'  'In such cases, we usually hold a knife. Maybe it gives us confidence,' I said.  A dot in the sky started enlarging. It soon turned into a flying cart which landed on the slope. Hermes and Hephaestus stepped out of it and approached.  'So Prometheus talked you into releasing him after all, didn't he?' sneered Hermes to Heracles.  'So what if he's released me?' I asked. 'If the negotiations fail, you'll bind me again.'  'You must stay bound to the crag all the time!'  'I am. The stone next to me is from the crag.'  'Prometheus hasn't talked me into anything,' clarified Heracles. 'When I wrapped him in a cloak, I touched him, and he was cold as a corpse. He was quite unwell, and I didn't think you'd leave him there. But I still checked, and I found you gone and him unconscious. If I hadn't released and warmed him, I doubt he'd be able to speak with you now.'  'I had to bring the cart,' said Hermes. 'Did Prometheus badmouth your father in front of you?'  'He said that it was thanks to my father that humans came to exist,' replied Heracles with resourcefulness that surprised me. Then Hermes turned to me:  'And you, Prometheus, dare not speak of negotiations! This is arrogance. The father of gods and men cannot negotiate with a wretch like you.'  'Oh he can. He wants something from me and I want something from him, so we'll negotiate. This is why you're here after all.'  'Hail Heracles! You've done my job, and done it quite well!' exclaimed Hephaestus joyously. He approached me, bent down and asked:  'Why are you lying, have you broken bones?' and added quietly so that Hermes wouldn't hear him, 'Don't tell the secret until he promises you freedom!'  'I am just injured and exhausted,' I replied and winked to show that I had understood. He was my dear friend as before, and I wouldn't let anything come between us.  'No personal conversations!' Hermes interrupted us and also approached me. 'Father Zeus said that you must first divulge the secret and only then be unbound. But if you are reasonable and don't fall back to your old obstinacy, it won't matter which one has been first. Come on! All I want from you is a name.'  'And what about my conditions?'  'The titans are already free, as Arce has told you.'  'And the humans?'  'Zeus needn't promise anything about the humans. He has changed his attitude to them. He doesn't want anymore to wipe them out and replace them with a better race.'  'This is already impossible anyway,' I pointed out.  'Of course, he removes individual humans.'  'Only individuals?'  'Well, also groups that become too evil or too proud.'  'Only in such cases?'  'Or if they become too numerous,' reluctantly admitted Hermes and cast a quick glance at Heracles to see how the member of the human race felt about this discussion. The hero was admiring the mountain peaks and seemed quite uninterested in the negotiations.  'So be it,' I said. 'Then I only want Zeus to give me back my freedom.'  'Unthinkable! You are a criminal who doesn't deserve freedom, and when you were free, you kept making epic messes. But you'll receive the treatment you need, and you'll be treated well. If you behave well, you may even have visitations from time to time.'  'It had to be so from the beginning. But after everything I endured, now I want freedom. Not to be locked up and the key be thrown away.'  'You cannot demand to walk free around Olympus and disturb the Thunderer! This is simply not serious!'  'If Father Zeus doesn't want Prometheus on Olympus, let him stay with us,' chimed in Heracles. 'I'll bring him to Colchis, it's a barbarian city but is well managed and must have good healers. When he gets better, I can take him home in Tiryns. Or he may settle in Athens. My friend Theseus who rules there wants to increase literacy and meets with open arms anyone who can read.'  Heracles' expression was quite innocent though he would later admit that he was trying to catch Hermes at his word.  'Unthinkable!' shouted Hermes again. 'Prometheus among the humans again, may the Moirae save us from this!' Then he turned to me: 'Have you learned nothing during all these years? If you had admitted your fault and had repented, your lot would have been far better. But no, you want Zeus to release you while still behaving as his enemy.'  'On the contrary, I was very loyal,' I said. 'I revealed right away that the danger would come from a new union. If I hadn't warned him, Zeus would have laid with that maiden long ago, and would fall from his... high chair. But now, to keep his power, it's enough to stick to Hera and all the other ladies he already has, plus the boy he has abducted from Phrygia. As long as he rules over himself, he'll rule over the world...'  'Watch your tongue! And if you don't want new torture, don't mention Ganymede!'  'I'm just describing the situation. Unless Zeus accepts my condition, he won't learn the secret. You know that when I want, I talk free, and when I don't want, nobody can force me. Time passes, and some wonderful day Zeus will be unable to restrain himself. An adversary will he prepare despite himself, a prodigy irresistible, even one who shall discover a flame mightier than the lightning and a deafening crash to outroar the thunder. Then, wrecked upon this evil, Zeus shall learn how different it is to be a sovereign and a slave.'  'Nonsense! The life span of our progeny is ever shortening. Zeus need not fear his son who will not be immortal. He demands the name from you just as a formality and a proof that you have been reformed.'  'Oh yes, his son will not be truly immortal. But our previous succession war lasted only ten years. Even ordinary humans live much longer. So I don't believe that it's just a formality. If so, why does Zeus recently lay only with Hera and mortal women... and with that boy?'  Hermes couldn't find an answer. I continued:  'Right now, Zeus seems more eager to keep me here than to learn the secret. But he'll change his mind, and will send you to me again. Today, Heracles barely brought me back to my senses. Next time, I may be unable to tell the name, even if I want to. I lose ever more words. Maybe I won't remember even my own name. And Zeus will blame you. You know that he always blames others for his mistakes.'  'This is nonsense! You are immortal.'  'My liver is immortal but my brain isn't. You said yourself that I am becoming like Epimetheus.'  Hermes was lost for words again. Then Hephaestus turned to him:  'Why don't you agree? You know that we all want Prometheus to return. I bet that even you want it. Why don't you promise him freedom on Zeus' behalf?'  'So be it,' Hermes sighed. 'He'll be free within the confines of Olympus.'  'And promise that Zeus won't hurt the maiden!' I added.  'Stop these offensive hints!'  'This is no hint. I remember what happened to Metis!'  'All right. I promise that Zeus won't hurt her.'  'Swear an oath!' I insisted. Hermes reluctantly swore and added:  'But you will not be acquitted. You are just a pardoned criminal, and will wear an ivy wreath in place of your chains, to differ from the rest and to remember your punishment.' Saying this, he took out a wreath.  'I refuse to admit guilt in this way!' I said and turned to Heracles with indignation: 'The inferior ones on Olympus wear ivy leaves, and they want to put an entire wreath on me!'  'Why do you care? It causes no pain, does it?' remarked Heracles. 'If you don't repent in words, others may think whatever they want. And we can bear wreaths in you honor.' Heracles brought out from his bag the olive branches and put them on his head in some crude resemblance of a wreath. Then he took the ivy wreath from Hermes and placed it on my head. This time, I did not object.  'Now, say her name,' said Hermes. However, I stayed silent. I felt that if I said it, something bad would happen, though I didn't yet know what exactly. Anxiety grew until finally Hephaestus spoke:  'Say it at last so that we can go home! Have you grown attached to the Caucasus? If you don't think of yourself, think of Pronoia! She has been inconsolable ever since you were bound here. She became gaunt and her eyes shine no more. Without you, there is no life for her!'  Something tore inside me. I turned to Hermes and sneered:  'Liar!'  'I haven't lied to you! I only said that Pronoia lives in Hephaestus' home and he has remarried! This is true, and it's no fault of mine if you have misunderstood me.'  Hephaestus and Heracles were watching us in dismay. Hermes admitted what it was about. Heracles cast an admonishing look while Hephaestus laughed and explained to me:  'We parted ways with Aphrodite and I married Aglaia, and Pronoia lives with us. This is the truth.' Then he turned to Hermes: 'Aren't you tired of all these lies? You deserve Prometheus to tear off your head! And I'll help him.'  'All right, but let him first say the name.'  I still had the dark foreboding but I wanted to live again, to return to Pronoia. I took a breath and said:  'Thetis.'  'Really?' exclaimed Hermes in disbelief. 'Of all goddesses and nymphs, exactly Thetis! It's hard to believe. Too convenient. Can you swear?'  'I swear by Styx that it's Thetis!'  'So it must be true after all. Father Zeus will be disappointed, for he hasn't given up on Thetis. He intended to take her as soon as you would confirm that it was not her.'  'Let him take her, why not!' Heracles said merrily. 'If he wishes her so much... I'd always prefer a beautiful maiden to a kingdom!'  'It won't get to this. He'll most likely give her as wife to some mortal.'  I immediately realized that, though Thetis herself had proposed this long ago, it was exactly the evil I had foreseen. She had escaped a trouble just to be afflicted by another one, and it was my fault. Alas, it was too late to swallow my words or to set a condition that Thetis does not suffer a forced marriage. I only said:  'No need to.'  'Now that Prometheus has revealed the secret, you'll return him to his wife, won't you? And you'll treat him well?' asked Heracles.  'Yes, we will,' replied Hermes and nodded.  'I am very glad! I knew that we could rely on the mercy and wisdom of Father Zeus! Prometheus cannot walk, may I carry him to your cart?'  'Yes, please! Prometheus, bid your rescuer farewell and let's go,' said Hermes.  Heracles lifted me, carried me to the cart and placed me on the back seat, then handed the stone to Hephaestus. I was so exhausted that couldn't even say farewell. I remember that Hephaestus, who was sitting next to me, was poking me and shouting: ""Don't fall asleep! Apollo said you shouldn't!"" but it was in vain. I fell asleep deeply, or maybe I fainted again.";;;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule;0;1;0;0;rule
